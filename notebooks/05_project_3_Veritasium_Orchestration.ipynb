      "*** Response: The number 37 seems to hold a special place in the minds of many people, as evidenced by the various instances and patterns surrounding it. From the sheer amount of coincidences and occurrences associated with the number 37, to its significance in psychology (such as the blue seven phenomenon), and even its prevalence as a common choice when asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100, there appears to be a mysterious allure to this particular number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematically, 37 also stands out in interesting ways. For instance, it is revealed as the median second prime factor of all numbers when analyzing the distribution of prime factors. Additionally, as a prime number, 37 falls into various categories such as irregular prime, Cuban prime, lucky prime, sexy prime, and more, showcasing its unique properties in the realm of mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the number 37 has been studied in different contexts, from its appearance in magic tricks like the \"37 force\" to its significance in decision-making techniques such as the secretary problem, where rejecting 37% of options can optimize the probability of finding the best choice. This number seems to crop up in various aspects of life, from birthdays to lottery numbers to historical events like the discovery of the 37th Mersenne Prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the number 37 holds a certain mystique, whether through its prevalence in everyday occurrences, its mathematical peculiarities, or its cultural references. It serves as a reminder of the intriguing patterns and mysteries that can be found in the seemingly mundane aspects of our lives.\n",

      "*** Response: According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, the speed of light is considered to be the ultimate speed limit in the universe. This theory states that nothing should move through space faster than light. While people may propose various ways to surpass this speed limit, such as using lasers or long sticks, the fundamental principle remains that nothing can actually travel faster than the speed of light. Even scenarios like shining a laser beam across the moon's surface faster than the speed of light are based on illusions and not actual faster-than-light travel. Einstein's principle of relativity also plays a crucial role in understanding the limitations imposed by the speed of light, as it affects concepts like time dilation and length contraction when approaching the speed of light. While there have been experimental results suggesting neutrinos exceeding the speed of light, many physicists remain skeptical, as the speed of light is widely regarded as a fundamental constant in the universe.\n",

      " Mathematics began as a way to quantify our world to measure land predict the motions of planets and keep track of commerce Then came a problem considered impossible The secret to solving it was to separate math from the real world to split algebra from geometry and to invent new numbers so fanciful they are called imaginary Ironically 400 years later these very numbers turn up in the heart of our best physical theory of the universe Only by abandoning maths connection to reality could we discover reality s true nature In 1494 Luca Pacioli who is Leonardo da Vinci s math teacher publishes Summa Arithmetica a comprehensive summary of all mathematics known in Renaissance Italy at the time In it there is a section on the cubic any equation which today we would write as ax cubed plus bx squared plus cx plus d equals zero People have been trying to find a general solution to the cubic for at least 4 000 years But each ancient civilization that encountered it the Babylonians Greeks Chinese Indians Egyptians and Persians they all came up empty handed Paceoli s conclusion is that a solution to the cubic equation is impossible Now this should be at least a little surprising since without the x cubed term the equation is simply a quadratic and many ancient civilizations had solved quadratics thousands of years earlier Today anyone who s passed 8th grade knows the general solution It s minus b plus minus root b squared minus 4ac all over 2a But most people just plug and chug into this formula completely oblivious to the geometry that ancient mathematicians used to derive it You know back in those days mathematics wasn t written down in equations it was written with words and pictures Take for example the equation x squared plus 26x equals 27 Ancient mathematicians would think of the x squared term like a literal square with sides of length x and then 26x well that would be a rectangle with one side of length 26 and the other side of length x and these two areas together add to 27 So how do we figure out what x is Well we can take this 26x rectangle and cut it in half So now I have two 13x rectangles and I can position them so the new shape I create is almost a square It s just missing this section down here But I know the dimensions of this section it s just 13 by 13 So I can complete the square by adding in a 13 by 13 square Now since I ve added 13 squared or 169 to the left hand side of the equation I also have to add 169 to the right hand side of the equation to maintain the equality So now I have this larger square with sides of length x plus 13 and it is equal to a hundred and ninety Now the square root of 196 is 14 so I know that the sides of this square have length 14 which means x is equal to 1 Now this is a great visual way to solve a quadratic equation but it isn t complete I mean if you look at our original equation x equals 1 is a solution but so is negative 27 For thousands of years math B\n",

      "ch of the thirteen chapters arrangements of the cubic equation Although he acknowledges the contributions of Tartaglia Delferro and Fior Tartaglia is displeased to say the least He writes insulting letters to Cardano and CCs a good fraction of the mathematics community And he has a point To this day the general solution to the cubic is often called Cardano s method But Ars Magna is a phenomenal achievement It pushes geometrical reasoning to its very breaking point Literally While Cardano is writing Ars Magna he comes across some cubic equations that can t easily be solved in the usual way like x cubed equals 15x plus 4 Plugging this into the algorithm yields a solution that contains Cardano asks Tartaglia about the case but he evades and implies Cardano is just not clever enough to use his formula properly The reality is Tartaglia has no idea what to do either Cardano walks back through the geometric derivation of a similar problem to see exactly what goes wrong While the 3D cube slicing and rearrangement works just fine the final quadratic completing the square step leads to a geometric paradox Cardano finds part of a square that must have an area of 30 but also sides of length 5 Since the full square has an area of 25 to complete the square Cardano has to somehow add Now this isn t the first time square roots of negatives show up in mathematics In fact earlier in R s magna is this problem Find two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40 You can combine these equations into the quadratic x squared plus 40 equals 10x But if you plug this into the quadratic formula the solutions contain the square root of roots of negatives The obvious conclusion is that a solution doesn t exist which you can verify by looking at the original problem There are no two real numbers which add to 10 and multiply to 40 So mathematicians You understood square roots of negative numbers were math s way of telling you there is no solution But this cubic equation is different With a little guessing and checking you can find that x equals 4 is a solution Why doesn t the approach that works for all other cupics find the perfectly reasonable solution to this one Unable to see a way forward Cardano avoids this case in Ars Magna saying the idea of the square root of negatives is as subtle as it is useless But around 10 years later the Italian engineer Raphael Bombelli picks up where Cardano left off Undeterred by the square roots of negatives and the impossible geometry they imply he wants to find a way through the mess to the solution Observing that the square root of a negative cannot be called either positive or negative he lets it be its own new type of number Bombelli assumes the two terms in Cardano s solution can be represented as some combination and this new type of number which involves the square root of negative 1 And this way Bombelli figures out that the two cube roots in Cardano s equation are equivalent to 2\n",

      " What would it look like to ride alongside a beam of light This is a question Einstein asked over a hundred years ago Now the trouble was he couldn t actually do the experiment so he had to use his imagination He had to do a thought experiment to figure out what a reasonable outcome would be Einstein s intuition told him that the world should feel the same in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity These are called inertial frames of reference So it doesn t matter if you re in a train or on a plane or in a car or in a room As long as you re moving with constant velocity the laws of physics should apply in exactly the same way And this is what s called the principle of relativity Is there a speed limit the universe I don t think so So you can go as fast as you want Probably Could we go as fast as light Sure eventually absolutely Can you compare the speed of sound and the speed of light It s however many times quicker isn t it because you ve got the Lighting and thunder Roughly how much quicker is light Ten times Roughly ten times Ten times I think it s a ten or a hundred I don t know Something like that The answer for you is a million Oh Light is a million times faster than sound Perhaps thought or Thought is faster than light Yeah it s immediate It s there Let s do a little thought experiment Let s say I m on a train traveling the speed of light that way Who am I kidding This is City Rail We re lucky to be moving But let s use our imagination So let s say I m traveling at the speed of light this way If I hold up a mirror in front of my face will I be able to see my reflection Do you see the problem In order for me to see my reflection light has to bounce off my face and travel to the mirror But if the mirror is going forwards at the speed of light how is the light ever going to catch up So a logical answer would be that no you can t see your face in a mirror when you re on a train traveling at the speed of light violates the principle of relativity because it means that I can tell I m in a frame of reference that s going at the speed of light that way Ah crap not again So let s consider the other option Maybe I do see my reflection which means the light must travel from my face to the mirror at its regular speed the speed of light But now the problem is someone outside the train would see light traveling at twice the speed of light Because I m already traveling at the speed of light and the light is traveling at the speed of light relative to me If that makes any sense So that leads to a really inconsistent answer Because how can the speed of light be twice the speed of light in that frame of reference So Einstein s conclusion was that I must see my reflection because otherwise it violates the principle of relativity But in order for me inside the train to measure the same speed of light as someone outside the train the train must actually contract in the dire\n",

      "ty But in order for me inside the train to measure the same speed of light as someone outside the train the train must actually contract in the direction that it s moving and my time must tick by slower relatively relative to someone outside So Einstein changed what we thought were absolutes space and time and made something that seemed like it should be relative the speed of light into the true universal constant So what would it look like to travel alongside a beam of light Well according to Einstein we ll never know because we can t go that fast At that speed our length would become zero time would stop relative to an outside observer and perhaps worst of all our mass would become infinite But a recent experimental result has suggested that neutrinos can go faster than light Still most physicists think that well this result probably won t hold up to scrutiny because the just so well established nowadays But who knows perhaps one day we ll find a way to break what we thought was the universal speed limit the speed of light\n",

      "The speed of light is meant to be the ultimate speed limit in the universe According to Einstein s special theory of relativity nothing should move through space faster than light But that doesn t stop people from trying Every day I get a lot of messages proposing ways to go faster than the speed of light There is the classic method where you shine a laser at the moon If you can flick that beam across the moon s surface in less than a hundredth of a second which is not hard to do then that laser spot will actually move across the surface of the moon faster than the speed of light Imagine what that would look like if you were standing on the moon If you were quick enough to perceive it you would see this laser spot move faster than the light coming out of your own laser How is that even possible Well in truth nothing here is really traveling faster than the speed of light The individual particles of light the photons coming out of my laser are still traveling to the moon at the speed of light It s just that they re landing side by side in such quick succession that they form a spot which moves faster than the speed of light but really it s an illusion Nothing is actually going faster than that than the speed of light so you couldn t transmit any information this way Dan asked what if instead of a laser we used a long rigid stick instead Now surely if you flick your wrist the tip of the stick must move across the surface of the moon faster than the speed of light Well unfortunately this won t work either As we learned in the slinky drop experiment the fastest a force can propagate through an object is the speed of sound That s because each atom needs to bump into the one next to it to transmit that force And this is a lossy process be lucky if any of the energy you put in at the start actually made it to the tip You d be lucky if the tip moved at all Now this is a really sophisticated idea Girard writes a very special space age engine would need to be designed that is capable of doing 10 000 plus RPM in outer space with very high torque Consult Elon Musk for this As the engine is spinning it slowly deploys two very long tethers made from carbon nanotubes on opposing sides Eventually each carbon nanotube tether reaches an amazing length of 285 kilometers At this point the end of the tether will be traveling at the speed of light Can you point out some reasons as to why it would not work Yes Gerard yes I can First any object going in a circle requires a force pulling it in towards the middle of that circle That s called centripetal force and you can feel it when you whirl a ball above your head Now that force is dependent on the speed of the object squared So if that gets to be too great the tether breaks Now if you have had a single gram rotating at 99 the speed of light the amount of force required to pull it towards the center would be 300 mega Newtons That is the weight of 6 000 fully grown Af\n",

      "nd use a single clock at the start to time the full 2km round trip wanted to do this So that sounds a little like how the speed of light was first experimentally measured by Ippolite Fizeau in 1849 He shone a beam of light between the teeth of a rapidly spinning gear to a hill 8 kilometers away And then by increasing the speed of the gear he reached a point where the reflected light passed through the next gap on the gear and so it was observed So he measured the speed of light to be 313 000 kilometers per second is within 5 of the presently accepted value So someone has measured the speed of light Or have they What has been measured is the round trip or two way speed of light But no one has measured the one way speed of light like a Veritasium video in just one direction It s possible that the speed of light is half of c in one direction and then instantaneous on the return journey What That s possible Are you serious Think about communicating with an astronaut stranded on Mars Let s call him Mark We send out a signal and get a response 20 minutes later So we imagine our signal takes 10 minutes to get there and the reply takes 10 minutes to come back But it s It s possible that our message took all 20 minutes to get there and the reply came back instantaneously There s no way we could tell the difference between these two scenarios But why would the speed of light be different Well it s possible that there is some preferred direction through space time I mean our universe has a lot of symmetries but there is also some asymmetry For example why is there so much matter relative to antimatter And physicists have worked out internally consistent theories of physics in which the speed of light is different forwards and in reverse The speed of light could vary by just a few percent up to at the extreme going C over 2 in one direction infinitely fast in the other direction Okay so let me let me figure I kind of don t believe you I kind of don t believe you I don t believe you that light is a different speed in one direction but in the other But I know you well enough to know that you wouldn t you wouldn t call me and put a camera on me Unless you knew you were right and that s what scares me about this Now you might think it is just simpler that light should travel at the same speed in all directions but the truth is that is a convention rather than an experimentally verified fact Einstein himself pointed this out in his famous 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies He spends the first couple of pages on the problem of synchronizing clocks at different locations A and B And he says there is no way that we can meaningfully compare the times they measure He s essentially defining that the speed of light in opposite directions is the same And he puts by definition in italics to remind us that this is only a convention It s known as the Einstein synchronization convention So the idea that the spee\n",

Such techniques can only be used for measuring distances out to several hundred light years. Leavitt's great insight was that while no one knew the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud, all its stars must be roughly the same distance from Earth. Therefore, a relationship she discovered in it, between the period of certain variable stars (Cepheids) and their apparent brightness, reflected a relationship in their absolute brightness. Once calibrated by measuring the distance to a nearby star of the same type via parallax, her discovery became a measuring stick with vastly greater reach. \n",
      "After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula, and, using Leavitt's Law, calculated that their distance was far too great to be part of the Milky Way and were separate galaxies in their own right. This settled astronomy's Great Debate over the size of the universe. Hubble later used Leavitt's Law, together with galactic redshifts, to establish that the universe is expanding (see Hubble's law).\n",

      "On November 22nd 2014 a burst of x rays was detected by ASSASSIN That s the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae But this was no supernova The signal came from the center of a galaxy around 290 million years ago light years away And what we now believe happened was a star came too close to a supermassive black hole with a mass millions of times that of our Sun and it was eaten The black hole fed on the star And yes this is the actual terminology astrophysicists use to describe it Events like these are thought to be rare occurring maybe once every 10 to 100 000 years in a galaxy They re called tidal disruption events or tidal disruption flares As the star approached the side closer The forces to the black hole experienced a much stronger gravitational pull than the other side ripping the star to shreds Matter spiraling into the black hole formed an accretion disk an annular ring of gas and dust that s accelerating and heating up emitting visible light UV and x rays observable from Earth Now what s remarkable about this event is that it transformed a dormant or quiescent black hole one that wasn t really feeding into one that we can observe thanks to the matter falling in from that star this is what it looked like Okay if you re disappointed check out these artist renditions of the same event But if you re cynical you might say well how do we know that That s what really happened What if the scientists are just making this up to get more grant funding or to inspire people to go into science Well I ll explain how we know this is actually what went down But first things got weirder Scientists trained three x ray telescopes to observe this part of the sky for years after the event And what they found was a strong and regular pulse of x rays brightening and dimming every 131 seconds And it shows up in the data from all three telescopes They observed periodically over 450 days but the pulse maintained this rhythm and didn t get weaker In fact as time went on the relative strength of the pulse got stronger modulating the X ray signal by around 40 What was causing these periodic flashes of X rays And what could it tell us about the black hole Well let s back up because black holes are some of the simplest objects in the universe By that I just mean that they are characterized by only two attributes mass and spin Okay there s also charge but since black holes should essentially be neutral mass and spin are the two that count Mass is relatively easy to determine Far away from a black hole you can even use Newtonian physics by measuring the gravitational effects of the black hole on other bodies you can estimate the mass of the black hole This has been done and black holes have been found with masses ranging from just a few times our Sun stellar mass black holes up to billions of solar masses supermassive black holes It s generally accepted supermassive black hole at the centers of most galaxies inclu\n",

      "holes up to billions of solar masses supermassive black holes It s generally accepted supermassive black hole at the centers of most galaxies including our own But what about spin Since black holes form from collapsing stars and all known stars rotate all black holes should also be rotating I mean what are the chances that a bunch of matter just collapses into a point perfectly with no rotation It s just not going to happen And then additional matter falling into the black hole contributes its angular momentum So like a figure skater pulling their arms into a porous object you can imagine black holes get spinning pretty fast But spin is harder to measure because unlike mass it only affects objects relatively close to the black hole But there is a way to do it Actually three ways To understand all of them have to understand ISCO In Newtonian physics around a compact mass you can place an object in a circular orbit at any radius and it will be stable It doesn t matter how close you get This is not the case according to general relativity Here there of the accretion disk is at our isco What s useful for our purposes is that our isco depends on the spin of the black hole The faster it s spinning the smaller our isco becomes assuming it s spinning in the same direction as the matter in the accretion disk The rotation enables particles to orbit closer to the black hole than they d be able to for a non spinning black hole So you can kind of think of it as though the spin is supporting the particles against the relentless pull of gravity Now spin is normally discussed in terms of a dimensionless parameter that ranges from zero no spin to one maximum spin Though I guess you could also have spins down to negative one if the black hole is spinning in the opposite direction from the accretion disk Now as spin increases our ISCO decreases by a factor of 6 shrinking down to the size of the event horizon And this sets what many scientists think is the maximum span a black hole can have Because if the minimum stable orbit were the size of the event horizon then light could escape from the black hole allowing us to see into the singularity This is called a naked singularity and it makes a lot of scientists uncomfortable As yet there isn t a strong theoretical reason why a black hole can t exceed this maximum spin It s just that we haven t seen one and the thought of an exposed singularity just kind of feels wrong Most suspect the maximum real world spin parameter is around 0 998 So how can you use our Isco to measure the spin of a black hole Well first let s think about how we measure the size of anything far away from us in deep space like the radius of a star Most stars are so far away that they re simply point objects in our telescopes So how can you figure out their radii Well first look at the spectrum of their light and by seeing how red shifted absorption lines are you can determine how far away the star\n",

      "*** Response: Black holes are fascinating astronomical objects predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity. They are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them once it crosses the event horizon. When matter falls into a black hole, it forms an accretion disk that emits visible light, UV, and X-rays. Black holes come in different sizes, from stellar-mass black holes to supermassive black holes found at the centers of galaxies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formation of a black hole occurs when a massive star collapses under its gravity at the end of its life cycle. All known stars rotate, so it is believed that black holes should also be spinning due to the conservation of angular momentum. The spin of a black hole is harder to measure than its mass but can be determined by observing the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) of the accretion disk. The spin affects the size of the ISCO, with faster-spinning black holes having a smaller ISCO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Black holes have been detected indirectly through the effects they have on nearby objects and by observing the radiation emitted by the accretion disk. Recent advancements in technology, such as the Event Horizon Telescope, have allowed scientists to capture the first-ever image of a black hole in the galaxy Messier 87. These discoveries confirm the existence of black holes and provide valuable insights into the extreme gravitational phenomena predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n",

      "J Robert Oppenheimer might be the most important physicist to have ever lived He never won a Nobel Prize but he changed the world more than most Nobel Prize winners Under his leadership the best physicist of the 20th century built the atomic bomb forever changing the course of history He has affected every war waged and every peace settlement since the end of World War II He also created a way for humanity to destroy itself Now I am become death the destroyer of worlds This video is about how to build an atomic bomb the life of Oppenheimer and why serious scientists were worried about the explosion setting fire to the atmosphere ending all life on Earth Part of this video is brought to you by Wren When J Robert Oppenheimer was 21 he placed an apple laced with toxic chemicals on the desk of his physics tutor The tutor Patrick Blackett was an experimentalist and he had hounded Robert to do more of what he thought Robert wasn t very good at experimental work Oppenheimer had already been spending his days in a corner of J J Thompson s basement laboratory attempting to make thin films of beryllium which were used to study electrons But Oppenheimer was clumsy and not good at this work He was soon avoiding his duties in the lab spending his time listening to lectures and reading physics journals It was 1925 and the 21 year old Oppenheimer was becoming fascinated by the new field of quantum mechanics Despite being surrounded by brilliant physicists like Rutherford and Chadwick Oppenheimer was deeply unhappy He wrote and I m so bad at it that it s impossible to feel that I m learning anything A friend walked in on him lying on the floor of his room which he called a miserable hole groaning and rolling from side to side in emotional anguish It was In this state Robert attempted to poison Blackett The specifics are lost to history There are conflicting reports if Oppenheimer used cyanide or something he found in the lab which would have just made Blackett sick This story sounds Unbelievable but Oppenheimer himself confirmed it Luckily Blackett did not eat the apple but the attempted poisoning became known to the Cambridge University authorities Robert s parents were visiting their son from the US at the time and Julius Oppenheimer successfully lobbied Cambridge not to press criminal charges Due to his family s wealth Robert wasn t even expelled from Cambridge on the condition that he had periodic counselling sessions with a psychiatrist in London In the summer of 1926 Robert traveled to the University of G ttingen The chairman of the department was Max Born who just two years earlier had coined the term quantum mechanics Born was reportedly a thought full and gentle teacher and had nurtured the work of Werner Heisenberg Wolfgang Pauli Enrico Fermi and Eugene Wigner Basically the who s who of quantum mechanics The class that Oppenheimer was in was also extraordinary including luminaries like Pau\n",
