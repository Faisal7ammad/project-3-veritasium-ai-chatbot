      " Most people don t know how bicycles actually work So we modified this bike to prove it This video is sponsored by KiwiCo More about them at the end of the show controller that allows him to lock out the steering to one side So what he s going to do is as I m biking he s going to pick whether I can turn either to the left or to the right So go for it I m giving it a left turn it pulls the pin out But you can see that you can still fully steer after I ve pulled the pin out I ve armed it There s where it locks Okay Now that s when your LED comes on That just says turn that way Turn left Yeah And if I try to turn right Can t I can t And if I try to turn left you can I can So the question is can I successfully execute this left hand turn Should we give it a shot I mean he s not going to tell me whether it s left or right so I have to look at the LED to know which way I can still turn You let me know when you re ready Okay No That was meant to be a turn to the right but there was no chance in hell Left Right If you look closely you can see the problem Here I m trying to turn right but steering that That way puts me off balance If you could ride this bicycle you would find it s impossible to turn left without first steering right and it s impossible to turn right without first steering left This seems wrong I think most people believe you turn a bike simply by pointing the handlebars in the direction you want to go After all this is how you drive a car Point the front wheels any direction you like and the car just goes that way But the difference with a bicycle is steering doesn t just affect the direction you re headed it also affects your balance Imagine you want to make a right turn so you steer the handlebars to the right What you ve done is effectively steered the bike out from under you so now you re leaning to the left And the ground puts a force on the bike to the left so the only way not to fall is to steer the bike to the left You have made a left turn If you really wanted to turn right you ve first have to counter steer to the left so you can lean right into the turn This is something anyone who rides a bike knows intuitively but not explicitly Film someone riding a bike towards you and tell them which direction to turn and you will find they counter steer without even thinking about it stick on your hand If I m balancing it and I just start walking toward you it will always fall away from you If I want to walk toward you it s easy enough to do and people inherently know how to do it If I pull it backward I can now start walking that way I have to initially If you want to move the pendulum somewhere you first move the base in the opposite direction And now the pendulum is leaning in the direction you want to go so you can move with it And it s the same with a unicycle In order to go forward first you have to pedal back So you re leaning forward and then you can go fo\n",

      "so therefore it has to accelerate that logic doesn t work We ll just have a look at this video by George Hart Watch this Again I pull the same pedal backward but now the bike moves forward I ll put a link to the full video here and a link to his website in the description The pedal even when you re pushing back on it never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground It s always moving forwards So if you drag a string behind the pedal of a bike moving forward the string is always moving forward Now just play that movie backward in your mind and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward They move forward together so they move backward together Another way to think about this is to consider the path traced out by the pedal as the bike moves forward For all ordinary bikes the pedals are moving much slower than the tires so the pedal is always going forward with respect to the ground But George modified his bike so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front spring rocket to the back sprocket This ultra low gear changes the trochoid so the pedal does actually go backwards with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards That s why he could pull back on the pedal and make the bike go forwards This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel you could actually get the train to move forwards if you pulled backwards with enough force For all normal bicycles pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards But depending on the gear ratio you can get the bike to move forwards So it was those people who said it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back wheel that were actually the most correct\n",

      "How do bikes without riders stay upright As long as a bike is moving with sufficient speed it can keep coasting indefinitely But it turned out the ground where we went to test this effect was really bumpy But the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations and remain stable So how does it do this I think most people believe it s the wheels spinning that creates some sort of gyroscopic effect that resists falling over Just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession the wheels stays upright even though gravity is pulling it down But this is not why bikes are stable Just watch what happens when we lock the handlebars completely so you can only go straight ahead The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they re cleverly designed to steer themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them\n",

      "ike back under you The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they re cleverly designed to steer themselves themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them At least three mechanisms are responsible for a bike s corrective steering The first is that due to the angle of the front fork the steering axis intersects the ground in front of where the wheel touches the ground So if the bike starts leaning to the left the force from the ground on the tire turns the wheel to the left If the bike starts leaning right the The force from the ground pushes the wheel to the right The front wheel of a bicycle is essentially a caster wheel like those you find on strollers or shopping carts Whichever way you drive them the wheel falls in line and rolls in the same direction The second reason for a bike s corrective steering is that the center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel are located slightly in front of the steering axis So when the bike leans left their weight pushes the front wheel to the left If the bike leans right their weight steers And the third mechanism is a gyroscopic effect but it doesn t keep the bike upright directly it just helps steer If you have a gyroscope and you push down on the left hand side the gyro will turn left If you push down on the right side it will turn right This is known as gyroscopic precession It seems as though the force you apply takes effect 90 degrees from where you applied it So bikes are stable primarily because of steering They have built in mechanisms for steering themselves In fact you don t need all three mechanisms to create a stable bike Researchers created this weird looking bicycle to prove a point It has no gyroscopic Thanks to counter rotating wheels above the wheels that touch the floor Plus there is no caster effect because the front wheel touches the floor in front of the steering axis But this bike is made stable by its mass distribution the force of gravity on which steers it in the direction of any lean Understanding how bicycles work is still an active area of research There is a program you can use to input all the different bicycle parameters and see the range of speed speeds over which it is self stable And this research is leading to better bikes This prototype has a smart motor in the handlebars to actively help steer keeping the bike upright even at low speeds I guess it s fitting that we are still learning new things about bicycles since most of us are able to ride one without any knowledge of how we re actually doing it of awesome hands on projects and toys designed to expose kids to STEAM concepts And with the holidays fast approaching a KiwiCo subscription is the perfect gift for any of the young people in your life KiwiCo now has nine different subscription lines for different age groups and topics Plus they ship to more than 40 countries I\n",

      "Bot Response 1: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to specific video URLs. However, based on the information retrieved from the Veritasium videos, I can summarize how bikes work:\n",
      "\n",
      "- When riding a bike, steering doesn't just affect the direction you're headed, but also your balance. To turn right, you first have to counter steer to the left to lean into the turn.\n",
      "- Bicycles are stable without riders due to clever design features that allow them to steer themselves. The three mechanisms responsible for a bike's corrective steering are: the angle of the front fork, the center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel, and a gyroscopic effect that helps steer.\n",
      "- Researchers have created unusual bicycles to explore the principles of stability, such as one with counter-rotating wheels above the floor that is stable due to mass distribution and gravity.\n",

      "Recently some friends of mine went to the Gordon Dam in Tasmania which is 126 5 meters or 415 feet high Then they dropped a basketball over the edge You can see that the basketball gets pushed around a bit by the breeze but it lands basically right below where it was dropped Now watch what happens when they drop another basketball but this time with a bit of backspin Whoa look at that go This is Brett who just threw it I literally just dropped it with a bit of spin like I didn t even throw it and it just took off like we had no idea that was gonna do that And this is where I come in The basketball was subject to the Magnus effect which affects all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air and it works like this As the basketball picks up speed air on the front side of the ball is going in the same direction as its spin and therefore it gets dragged along with the ball and deflected back Air on the other side is moving opposite to the ball spin so the flow separates from the ball instead of getting deflected The net result is the ball pushes air one way so the air applies an equal force on the ball the other way And this is known as the Magnus effect named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852 Of course Isaac Newton beat him to it by nearly 200 years describing the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College But you know he s got enough stuff named after him This effect is very important in sports like tennis soccer and golf But could it have non sport applications Perhaps This is a sailboat I know it doesn t look like a sailboat but those aren t chimneys They are spinning cylinders called Flettner rotors and they take the place of the sails They deflect crosswinds using the Magnus effect to propel the ship forwards And this is a plane with spinning cylinders instead of wings Using the Magnus effect the cylinders actually generate more lift than traditional wings However they also generate way more drag making them impractical This plane only flew once and then it crashed But the Magnus effect is making a comeback Here is an experimental rotor wing aircraft which generates all its lift from spinning cylinders And this is the E Ship One which uses four spinning cylinders that s four Flettner rotors to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns So in the future the Magnus effect may help more than just basketballs fly Now the real reason my friends from How Ridiculous were at the dam was to set the world record for the highest basket ever scored So go check out their channel and the video and subscribe to them for more epic trick shots\n",

      "As of today I have been making YouTube videos full time for 10 years So to celebrate I am answering your questions Plus I like this beautiful spinning top from Vorso and other items from my videos So if you want to win one of those then write down the characters that will appear randomly in the top right corner of this video Those will be your password to the form in the description So let s get into it Why did you start doing YouTube Because I always wanted to be a filmmaker As a kid I loved doing plays and musicals I had the most fun of my life when I was working with creative other people but I always thought that a career in the traditional film or TV industry was a terrible idea and like your was out of your control It seemed to rely on a big break I don t think those industries were meritocracies So for basically my whole life until I was 28 I did the safe thing and I studied engineering and physics and did a PhD in physics and then I taught people physics and I love science but I also love just the craft of putting together a film or a video and sending it out into the world and I think this makes a lot of sense because I like learning about science and I liked performing and that is exactly what making YouTube videos allows me to do You know the process of doing science is very different from the process of learning science And so I think it s not surprising that this is the thing that I love about more than being a scientist I have been on YouTube for 10 years and it was starting to show There was so much gray in my beard that I m shaving it off to wind back the clock I am giving away this fully specced 2017 MacBook Pro I use this to make a lot of my videos but those are all wiped off here now so it s just a nicely specced laptop that you could use to make more videos if you wanted Any advice you have for people coming out of high school or college and unsure how to take their first steps The key is just start doing it After making my YouTube channel for a few months I sort of snuck into a science awards in Sydney in Australia and there I found sort of the executive producer of the only science show on Australian television and I got his business card the very next day I emailed him and I sent him links to all of the videos or you know the videos I was most proud of anyway and I didn t really expect to hear anything but three weeks later I got an email back from him and he was like these are really good why don t you come in and we ll have a chat And I think the key to that interaction was I had stuff to show him I didn t go to him and say hey I d love to be involved in your TV program You know what can I do for you What do you need done You know I came to him and I said that s what I m capable of and if that s of interest to you then great I have literally thousands of Penrose tiles that I will be sending out if you want them I m giving these away I will send you 21 and then 13 darts of anoth\n",

      "I want to talk about Khan Academy If you haven t heard of it you should definitely check it out One guy Sal Khan has made thousands of videos over 2 200 at the moment on everything from math to history and also quite a few videos about science And there are a lot of things to love about Khan Academy First of all everything s freely available through YouTube Khan s goal is to improve the education for all students and he is an exceptional teacher and absolutely fantastic speaker He also emphasizes mastery which I think is very important so students in the program can only move on after completing ten questions in a row correctly He s also developed some activities and software and he s working with schools to try to humanize the classroom to try to help improve the quality of student teacher time He s pushing the learning well beyond that the video area But I want to put that work aside for a moment and just focus on the millions of viewers who watch his science videos online You see I m skeptical that they actually promote some meeting for learning and that s not just a comment about Khan s videos but a comment on science videos in general So let me explain that skepticism I wrote my PhD thesis on how to create films to teach science specifically physics In a typical study students accessed a website where they took a multiple choice pre test The questions were something like consider a basketball player shooting from the free throw line After the ball leaves his hand the force on the ball is 8 a upwards and constant b upwards and decreasing c downwards and constant d downwards and decreasing or e tangent to the path of the ball Take a minute to think about which answer you would pick and what you think most other people would pick After the pre test students were randomly assigned to see one of several online videos The videos contained correct answers to many of the pre test questions For example here s a clip Now we ll consider a case where gravitational force is the only force acting on an object While a juggling ball is in the air we ll ignore air resistance because it s so small only one force acts on the ball throughout its flight This is the force of gravity which is constant and downwards Gravity accelerates the ball in the downwards direction After being thrown up slower upwards Its velocity goes through zero and then it speeds up in the downward direction The whole time the ball is accelerating downwards then it meets the juggler s hand Immediately after watching the roughly 10 minute video the students took exactly the same test I also interviewed some students to see what they thought of the video The most common comments were that it was clear concise to understand The students also increased their confidence in the correctness of their answers compared to the pretest So what about how much they learned On the pretest the average score was 6 0 out of 26 And after t\n",

      " What would it look like to ride alongside a beam of light This is a question Einstein asked over a hundred years ago Now the trouble was he couldn t actually do the experiment so he had to use his imagination He had to do a thought experiment to figure out what a reasonable outcome would be Einstein s intuition told him that the world should feel the same in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity These are called inertial frames of reference So it doesn t matter if you re in a train or on a plane or in a car or in a room As long as you re moving with constant velocity the laws of physics should apply in exactly the same way And this is what s called the principle of relativity Is there a speed limit the universe I don t think so So you can go as fast as you want Probably Could we go as fast as light Sure eventually absolutely Can you compare the speed of sound and the speed of light It s however many times quicker isn t it because you ve got the Lighting and thunder Roughly how much quicker is light Ten times Roughly ten times Ten times I think it s a ten or a hundred I don t know Something like that The answer for you is a million Oh Light is a million times faster than sound Perhaps thought or Thought is faster than light Yeah it s immediate It s there Let s do a little thought experiment Let s say I m on a train traveling the speed of light that way Who am I kidding This is City Rail We re lucky to be moving But let s use our imagination So let s say I m traveling at the speed of light this way If I hold up a mirror in front of my face will I be able to see my reflection Do you see the problem In order for me to see my reflection light has to bounce off my face and travel to the mirror But if the mirror is going forwards at the speed of light how is the light ever going to catch up So a logical answer would be that no you can t see your face in a mirror when you re on a train traveling at the speed of light violates the principle of relativity because it means that I can tell I m in a frame of reference that s going at the speed of light that way Ah crap not again So let s consider the other option Maybe I do see my reflection which means the light must travel from my face to the mirror at its regular speed the speed of light But now the problem is someone outside the train would see light traveling at twice the speed of light Because I m already traveling at the speed of light and the light is traveling at the speed of light relative to me If that makes any sense So that leads to a really inconsistent answer Because how can the speed of light be twice the speed of light in that frame of reference So Einstein s conclusion was that I must see my reflection because otherwise it violates the principle of relativity But in order for me inside the train to measure the same speed of light as someone outside the train the train must actually contract in the dire\n",

      "The video explores Einstein's question about riding alongside a beam of light and the implications of traveling at the speed of light. Einstein's thought experiment delves into the challenges of traveling at light speed, such as time dilation and infinite mass. The principle of relativity and the universal constant of the speed of light are highlighted. It is discussed how Einstein's conclusions revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and the nature of light. The video also touches on experimental results suggesting faster-than-light neutrinos but emphasizes the skepticism surrounding these findings within the scientific community. Ultimately, the video reflects on the theoretical and practical limitations of surpassing the speed of light.\n"

      " Most people don t know how bicycles actually work So we modified this bike to prove it This video is sponsored by KiwiCo More about them at the end of the show controller that allows him to lock out the steering to one side So what he s going to do is as I m biking he s going to pick whether I can turn either to the left or to the right So go for it I m giving it a left turn it pulls the pin out But you can see that you can still fully steer after I ve pulled the pin out I ve armed it There s where it locks Okay Now that s when your LED comes on That just says turn that way Turn left Yeah And if I try to turn right Can t I can t And if I try to turn left you can I can So the question is can I successfully execute this left hand turn Should we give it a shot I mean he s not going to tell me whether it s left or right so I have to look at the LED to know which way I can still turn You let me know when you re ready Okay No That was meant to be a turn to the right but there was no chance in hell Left Right If you look closely you can see the problem Here I m trying to turn right but steering that That way puts me off balance If you could ride this bicycle you would find it s impossible to turn left without first steering right and it s impossible to turn right without first steering left This seems wrong I think most people believe you turn a bike simply by pointing the handlebars in the direction you want to go After all this is how you drive a car Point the front wheels any direction you like and the car just goes that way But the difference with a bicycle is steering doesn t just affect the direction you re headed it also affects your balance Imagine you want to make a right turn so you steer the handlebars to the right What you ve done is effectively steered the bike out from under you so now you re leaning to the left And the ground puts a force on the bike to the left so the only way not to fall is to steer the bike to the left You have made a left turn If you really wanted to turn right you ve first have to counter steer to the left so you can lean right into the turn This is something anyone who rides a bike knows intuitively but not explicitly Film someone riding a bike towards you and tell them which direction to turn and you will find they counter steer without even thinking about it stick on your hand If I m balancing it and I just start walking toward you it will always fall away from you If I want to walk toward you it s easy enough to do and people inherently know how to do it If I pull it backward I can now start walking that way I have to initially If you want to move the pendulum somewhere you first move the base in the opposite direction And now the pendulum is leaning in the direction you want to go so you can move with it And it s the same with a unicycle In order to go forward first you have to pedal back So you re leaning forward and then you can go fo\n",

      "so therefore it has to accelerate that logic doesn t work We ll just have a look at this video by George Hart Watch this Again I pull the same pedal backward but now the bike moves forward I ll put a link to the full video here and a link to his website in the description The pedal even when you re pushing back on it never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground It s always moving forwards So if you drag a string behind the pedal of a bike moving forward the string is always moving forward Now just play that movie backward in your mind and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward They move forward together so they move backward together Another way to think about this is to consider the path traced out by the pedal as the bike moves forward For all ordinary bikes the pedals are moving much slower than the tires so the pedal is always going forward with respect to the ground But George modified his bike so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front spring rocket to the back sprocket This ultra low gear changes the trochoid so the pedal does actually go backwards with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards That s why he could pull back on the pedal and make the bike go forwards This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel you could actually get the train to move forwards if you pulled backwards with enough force For all normal bicycles pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards But depending on the gear ratio you can get the bike to move forwards So it was those people who said it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back wheel that were actually the most correct\n",

      "How do bikes without riders stay upright As long as a bike is moving with sufficient speed it can keep coasting indefinitely But it turned out the ground where we went to test this effect was really bumpy But the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations and remain stable So how does it do this I think most people believe it s the wheels spinning that creates some sort of gyroscopic effect that resists falling over Just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession the wheels stays upright even though gravity is pulling it down But this is not why bikes are stable Just watch what happens when we lock the handlebars completely so you can only go straight ahead The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they re cleverly designed to steer themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them\n",

      "ike back under you The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they re cleverly designed to steer themselves themselves If they start falling to one side the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them At least three mechanisms are responsible for a bike s corrective steering The first is that due to the angle of the front fork the steering axis intersects the ground in front of where the wheel touches the ground So if the bike starts leaning to the left the force from the ground on the tire turns the wheel to the left If the bike starts leaning right the The force from the ground pushes the wheel to the right The front wheel of a bicycle is essentially a caster wheel like those you find on strollers or shopping carts Whichever way you drive them the wheel falls in line and rolls in the same direction The second reason for a bike s corrective steering is that the center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel are located slightly in front of the steering axis So when the bike leans left their weight pushes the front wheel to the left If the bike leans right their weight steers And the third mechanism is a gyroscopic effect but it doesn t keep the bike upright directly it just helps steer If you have a gyroscope and you push down on the left hand side the gyro will turn left If you push down on the right side it will turn right This is known as gyroscopic precession It seems as though the force you apply takes effect 90 degrees from where you applied it So bikes are stable primarily because of steering They have built in mechanisms for steering themselves In fact you don t need all three mechanisms to create a stable bike Researchers created this weird looking bicycle to prove a point It has no gyroscopic Thanks to counter rotating wheels above the wheels that touch the floor Plus there is no caster effect because the front wheel touches the floor in front of the steering axis But this bike is made stable by its mass distribution the force of gravity on which steers it in the direction of any lean Understanding how bicycles work is still an active area of research There is a program you can use to input all the different bicycle parameters and see the range of speed speeds over which it is self stable And this research is leading to better bikes This prototype has a smart motor in the handlebars to actively help steer keeping the bike upright even at low speeds I guess it s fitting that we are still learning new things about bicycles since most of us are able to ride one without any knowledge of how we re actually doing it of awesome hands on projects and toys designed to expose kids to STEAM concepts And with the holidays fast approaching a KiwiCo subscription is the perfect gift for any of the young people in your life KiwiCo now has nine different subscription lines for different age groups and topics Plus they ship to more than 40 countries I\n",

      "The video explores how bicycles work by modifying a bike to demonstrate key principles. It challenges the common belief that turning the handlebars directly steers the bike, explaining that steering affects both direction and balance. The modified bike highlights the need for countersteering to initiate turns and discusses how pulling back on the pedal can make the bike move forward based on gear ratios. It also explains the stability of bicycles without riders, attributing it to self-steering mechanisms rather than gyroscopic effects. The video delves into the intricate design and mechanisms that enable bicycles to stay upright and maneuver effectively.\n"

      " What would it look like to ride alongside a beam of light This is a question Einstein asked over a hundred years ago Now the trouble was he couldn t actually do the experiment so he had to use his imagination He had to do a thought experiment to figure out what a reasonable outcome would be Einstein s intuition told him that the world should feel the same in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity These are called inertial frames of reference So it doesn t matter if you re in a train or on a plane or in a car or in a room As long as you re moving with constant velocity the laws of physics should apply in exactly the same way And this is what s called the principle of relativity Is there a speed limit the universe I don t think so So you can go as fast as you want Probably Could we go as fast as light Sure eventually absolutely Can you compare the speed of sound and the speed of light It s however many times quicker isn t it because you ve got the Lighting and thunder Roughly how much quicker is light Ten times Roughly ten times Ten times I think it s a ten or a hundred I don t know Something like that The answer for you is a million Oh Light is a million times faster than sound Perhaps thought or Thought is faster than light Yeah it s immediate It s there Let s do a little thought experiment Let s say I m on a train traveling the speed of light that way Who am I kidding This is City Rail We re lucky to be moving But let s use our imagination So let s say I m traveling at the speed of light this way If I hold up a mirror in front of my face will I be able to see my reflection Do you see the problem In order for me to see my reflection light has to bounce off my face and travel to the mirror But if the mirror is going forwards at the speed of light how is the light ever going to catch up So a logical answer would be that no you can t see your face in a mirror when you re on a train traveling at the speed of light violates the principle of relativity because it means that I can tell I m in a frame of reference that s going at the speed of light that way Ah crap not again So let s consider the other option Maybe I do see my reflection which means the light must travel from my face to the mirror at its regular speed the speed of light But now the problem is someone outside the train would see light traveling at twice the speed of light Because I m already traveling at the speed of light and the light is traveling at the speed of light relative to me If that makes any sense So that leads to a really inconsistent answer Because how can the speed of light be twice the speed of light in that frame of reference So Einstein s conclusion was that I must see my reflection because otherwise it violates the principle of relativity But in order for me inside the train to measure the same speed of light as someone outside the train the train must actually contract in the dire\n",

Einstein's principle of relativity states that the laws of physics should apply the same way in all frames of reference moving at a constant velocity. The video explores the implications of traveling at the speed of light, including the challenges with seeing reflections in mirrors and the concept of time dilation. It also mentions the speed of light being the ultimate speed limit in the universe according to Einstein's special theory of relativity. The video concludes by mentioning a recent experimental result about neutrinos possibly traveling faster than light but notes that most physicists are skeptical about this claim.\n",

      "ell after completing his PhD Oppenheimer became a physics professor first at UC Berkeley and then at Caltech The brilliance he had shown under Max Born s tutelage didn t fade Indeed it blossomed into a remarkable but strange physics career In the 15 years after finishing his PhD Oppenheimer made important contributions He had a number of Nobel Prize winning ideas one of his students Willis Lamb became a Nobel Laureate but Oppenheimer himself was nominated three times but never actually won the Nobel Prize When asked why he thought that Oppenheimer never won the Nobel Prize Murray Gell Mann said that he didn t have sitzfleisch a German word that translates to sitting flesh the ability to sit down in a chair for a long time and do the hard work He never wrote a long paper or did a long calculation He didn t have the patience for that Wolfgang Pally also said his ideas are very good but his calculations are was wrong But Oppenheimer was amazing with people He was a natural and charismatic leader And this combination his charisma and his ability to generate great ideas would serve him well in the next phase of his life On the 18th of September 1942 General Leslie Groves was put in charge of the Manhattan Project On day one he ordered 1 200 tons of uranium ore The next day he ordered to buy the Oak Ridge site where the ore would be refined The next month in a surprising move he chose Oppenheimer to be the site The military establishment had concerns Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize so would the scientists hired for the project respect his opinion and follow his leadership Oppenheimer also had no prior administrative experience over a large project like this Furthermore he was a theoretical physicist who according to Isidore Rabi was a very impractical fellow He didn t know anything about equipment And then there was the problem of Oppenheimer s political stance He had links to the Communist Party including his wife Catherine who was a member of thought that Oppenheimer was a real genius saying that why Oppenheimer knows about everything He can talk to you about anything you bring up Well not exactly He doesn t know anything about sports The two men couldn t have been more different Oppenheimer weighed half as much as Groves despite both of them being nearly 6 feet tall Ideologically Oppenheimer was a communist Groves a staunch conservative But Groves was convinced that Oppenheimer would be the person that would build the atomic bomb before the Nazis And that was all that mattered Isidore Rabi later commented that hiring Oppenheimer for this role was a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves who was not generally considered to be a genius The Manhattan Project needed a location somewhere isolated to keep the project secret safe from enemy attack and while no one wanted to admit it somewhere that was sparsely populated just in case there was an accident He had fallen i\n",

      "Eugene Wigner Basically the who s who of quantum mechanics The class that Oppenheimer was in was also extraordinary including luminaries like Paul Dirac and John von Neumann Where the academic culture at Cambridge focused on experimental physics G ttingen was all about theoretical physics And under Max Born s mentorship Oppenheimer thrived His mental health improved and he found a community of people who were as obsessed with physics as he was On November 14th 1926 Robert wrote to Frank his younger brother Robert was thriving and his talent was being recognized Boren later wrote he was a man of great talent and he was conscious of his superiority in a way which was embarrassing and led to trouble When Oppenheimer was 23 he graduated with his PhD in physics He wrote his thesis in German on the quantum theory of continuous spectra All in all he published more than a dozen papers in the two years he was at Goodingen Many of them expanded upon the work of Werner Heidelberg Heisenberg who was just three years older than Oppenheimer The two eventually met in 1927 the same year Heisenberg published his groundbreaking paper on the quantum uncertainty principle By all accounts the pair got along well There was no way to know that just 15 years later they would be deadly rivals attempting to build the first nuclear bomb Oppenheimer for the USA and Heisenberg for Nazi Germany At the time it was thought that getting significant amounts of energy out of radioactive atoms was impossible Ever since the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel Marie and Pierre Curie in the late 1890s it was known that radioactivity was a passive process Unstable atoms would just decay at random unpredictable times And surely there was no way to control that In 1933 Ernest Rutherford Oppenheimer s old boss from Cambridge wrote that anyone who expects us source of power from the transformations of these atoms is talking moonshine That same year Albert Einstein said that there is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will So how would you break an atomic nucleus Well you could take a proton and accelerate it through a large electric field and then smash it into a nucleus This is exactly what John Cockroft and Ernest Walton did in a 1932 They accelerated protons into lithium nuclei breaking them apart The pair would later win a Nobel Prize for this work But a proton is positively charged so it s repelled by all nuclei which are also positively charged So to give them a hope of overcoming this barrier Cockroft and Walton had to use 250 000 volts to accelerate the protons Even then only about 1 in a billion protons actually hit and split lit a lithium nucleus So this would not be an effective way to get energy But there is another way In 1932 the neutron was discovered this subatomic particle that s about 0 1 heavier than a\n",

      "Henrietta Swan Leavitt (; July 4, 1868 – December 12, 1921) was an American astronomer. Her discovery of how to effectively measure vast distances to remote galaxies led to a shift in the scale and understanding of the scale and the nature of the universe. Nomination of Leavitt for the Nobel Prize had to be halted because of her death. \n",
      "A graduate of Radcliffe College, she worked at the Harvard College Observatory as a human computer, tasked with measuring photographic plates to catalog the positions and brightness of stars. This work led her to discover the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variables. Leavitt's discovery provided astronomers with the first standard candle with which to measure the distance to other galaxies.\n",
      "Before Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables (sometimes referred to as Leavitt's Law), the only techniques available to astronomers for measuring the distance to a star were based on stellar parallax. Such techniques can only be used for measuring distances out to several hundred light years. Leavitt's great insight was that while no one knew the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud, all its stars must be roughly the same distance from Earth. Therefore, a relationship she discovered in it, between the period of certain variable stars (Cepheids) and their apparent brightness, reflected a relationship in their absolute brightness. Once calibrated by measuring the distance to a nearby star of the same type via parallax, her discovery became a measuring stick with vastly greater reach. \n",
      "After Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula, and, using Leavitt's Law, calculated that their distance was far too great to be part of the Milky Way and were separate galaxies in their own right. This settled astronomy's Great Debate over the size of the universe. Hubble later used Leavitt's Law, together with galactic redshifts, to establish that the universe is expanding (see Hubble's law).\n",
