But it turned out the ground where we went to test this effect was really bumpy. But the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations.\n and remain stable. So how does it do this? I think most people believe it's the wheels spinning that creates some sort of gyroscopic effect that resists falling over. Just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession, the wheels\n stays upright even though gravity is pulling it down. But this is not why bikes are stable. Just watch what happens when we lock the handlebars completely, so you can only go straight ahead.\n The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they're cleverly designed to steer themselves. If they start falling to one side, the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them."

He asked, if all the world's scientific information except for one sentence were destroyed in some cataclysmic\n event. Which single statement would contain the most scientific information for future generations? His conclusion was that it is the Atomic Hypothesis.\n The atomic hypothesis states that all things are made up of atoms, tiny particles that are in perpetual motion. They attract each other when a little distance apart, but repel if squeezed together.\n together. That statement is incredibly important to understand if you want to understand most of the rest of science. Because everything is made of atoms, including you, and me, and the opera house, and the harbor bridge, and the\n and the trees and the grass and the air and the clouds and well you get the idea. Everything is made out of atoms. So it's really important to understand the atomic concept if you're going to understand the rest of science. The idea that\n Everything is made of tiny particles has been around for thousands of years. The oldest recorded texts are in Greece and India. In fact, the word atom comes from the Greek atomos meaning literally uncuttable.\n So, the idea that they had was if you took a piece of matter like this piece of aluminium foil, you could cut it in half.\n And in half again, each time reducing the number of atoms by half. But the idea was you could not go on doing that indefinitely, for there would come a point when you have only a single atom\n left and it is uncuttable. It's an atom. How many times do you think I could cut this A4 sheet of aluminium in half before I reach a single atom?\n you"

            "transcription": "Recently, some friends of mine went to the Gordon Dam in Tasmania, which is 126.5 meters, or 415 feet high. Then they dropped a basketball over the edge.\n You can see that the basketball gets pushed around a bit by the breeze, but it lands basically right below where it was dropped. Now watch what happens when they drop another basketball, but this time with a bit of backspin. Whoa, look at that go!\n This is Brett who just threw it. I literally just dropped it with a bit of spin like I didn't even throw it and it just\n took off like we had no idea that was gonna do that. And this is where I come in. The basketball was subject to the Magnus effect which affects all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air and it works like this. As the basketball picks up speed, air on\n the front side of the ball is going in the same direction as its spin and therefore it gets dragged along with the ball and deflected back. Air on the other side is moving opposite to the ball spin so the flow separates from the ball instead of getting deflected. The net result is\n the ball pushes air one way so the air applies an equal force on the ball the other way. And this is known as the Magnus effect named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852. Of course Isaac Newton beat him to it by nearly 200\n years describing the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College. But you know, he's got enough stuff named after him. This effect is very important in sports like tennis, soccer, and golf. But could it have non-sport applications? Perhaps.\n This is a sailboat. I know it doesn't look like a sailboat, but those aren't chimneys. They are spinning cylinders called Flettner rotors, and they take the place of the sails. They deflect crosswinds using the Magnus effect to propel the ship forwards.\n And this is a plane with spinning cylinders instead of wings. Using the Magnus effect, the cylinders actually generate more lift than traditional wings. However, they also generate way more drag, making them impractical. This plane only flew\n once and then it crashed. But the Magnus effect is making a comeback. Here is an experimental rotor wing aircraft which generates all its lift from spinning cylinders. And this is the E-Ship One which uses four spinning cylinders, that's four Flettner\n rotors to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns. So in the future the Magnus effect may help more than just basketballs fly.\n Now the real reason my friends from How Ridiculous were at the dam was to set the world record for the highest basket ever scored.

            "transcription": "How does a boomerang work? Well, it relies on three fundamental principles. Lift,\n relative velocity, and gyroscopic precession. Now a traditional Australian boomerang is basically just two wings stuck together, and both generate lift that keeps the boomerang in the air. But the thing is, as the boomerang is rotating,\n the top actually rotates with the direction the boomerang is moving, while the bottom is rotating in the opposite direction. So air flows faster over the top of the boomerang, creating more lift than over the bottom. So those unequal forces\n generate a torque and you might expect that torque to flip the boomerang over but it doesn't and that's because the boomerang is thrown with a very fast spin so that spin means that the boomerang has angular momentum a significant amount\n And if you want to figure out which direction that is, you put your fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation and your thumb points in the direction of the angular momentum. So as it's spinning, that torque actually changes the angular momentum. It changes the direction of rotation.\n the angular momentum in the direction of the torque and the torque in this case is back towards me so the angular momentum is changed to point around at me which allows this boomerang to execute its curved path and come back to where it started\n Now that phenomenon is known as gyroscopic precession. Now if you want to see an awesome boomerang shot, you've got to check out How Ridiculous. They tried to split an egg with a boomerang. And they've done lots of other cool tricks like catching a frisbee from a speedboat, so you've got to check it out and subscribe to\n to their channel and then come back to me and I will explain the physics of all of it to you.\n Yeah!\n Other fun facts about boomerangs? Although we usually associate them with Australia, they've also been found in places like ancient Egypt and Europe. And some of them apparently are non-returning boomerangs, and that makes me ask, well,\n what really makes it a boomerang if it doesn't come back to you. Some people call those throwing sticks, which I think sounds like a more apt name for something that doesn't come back to you. And you know, we've even tried boomerangs in space, so a boomerang will still fly, it'll still go around even\n in zero-g. That's pretty incredible. That's physics."

Let's watch that again in slow-mo and I will graph the scale readings.\n As you can see, during the lift the scale oscillates around 91 kilograms, the same as it read when I was stationary. So it seems the apparatus doesn't get heavier or lighter when it is lifted while spinning.

Professor Laithwaite claimed the gyroscope's properties couldn't be fully explained.\n explained by Newton's laws of motion. I disagree. But in order to understand why the wheel feels so light, we first have to consider why it feels heavy when it's not spinning. Holding the shaft horizontally, you clearly need to provide\n an upward force equal to the downward weight of the wheel. But this is not enough, because with only these two forces there would be a net torque causing the apparatus to rotate, so you need to create a counter torque in addition to supporting the weight of the wheel. This requires pushing down with one hand and\n pulling up with the other. And the upward force must be greater than the downward force by an amount equal to the weight of the wheel. So the force on each of your hands is significantly greater than the weight of the wheel. Now once the wheel is spinning, the torque due to its weight now causes it to process rather\n than fall to the ground. Therefore, no counter torque is necessary. You only need to supply an upward force equal to the wheel's weight, so it feels lighter. Now the trick to lifting the wheel over your head is to push it forwards as you release it. Lathe weight knew this. If you\n force a gyroscope to process faster, it lifts up. Similarly, if you slow the procession of a gyroscope, it goes down.\n dramatically. I'll show it to you Rod. It's hard to go back the way that it doesn't want to process. You can't say it becomes as light as a feather.\n It certainly doesn't become as light as a feather. I can say that too from having felt it. But it does feel lighter. And I think maybe part of that has to do with the fact that I'm not having to counter the torque with my hand.\n You know, all I have to do is support the weight of the disc, but I don't need to provide any torque with my hand to counter that gravitational torque, which is what makes it feel so awkward when you're trying to hold it when it's static. When you apply a torque, as you were,\n then there's a force up on one side of the hand and down on the other side. And if you decrease the force on both sides, then it will actually feel lighter. It feels lighter without actually getting lighter. Yeah, yeah. What it does\n is to decrease the apparent weight that you're feeling.\n you"

            "transcription": "Have you ever made ice cubes and then found that when you take them out of the freezer there are spikes on them? This phenomenon has caused a lot of curiosity and some concern. The truth is there's a simple physical process.\n responsible for ice cube spikes. Ice cubes cool first from their top surface where they're in direct contact with the cold freezer air and from which evaporative cooling can occur. So the first ice crystals form on the surface of the ice cube and along its edges.\n Now as that ice freezes it expands by roughly 8% and that is due to hydrogen bonding between the water molecules which makes them on average slightly further apart than they are in water. So as the ice grows in from all sides the water\n in the middle has nowhere to go and it is forced up and out through a hole in the ice. These holes are often triangular in shape because ice crystals tend to meet at 60 degree angles. As the water comes up through the hole it freezes around the edges\n forming a hollow spike and as the ice continues to grow more water is forced up the spike making it longer. This continues until all of the water has frozen or until the end of the spike freezes shut. If you want to make ice cube spikes they can be created\n in most ordinary freezers and there are three steps you can take to increase your chances. Number one, the ideal temperature seems to be not too cold between minus five and minus eight Celsius. That's cold enough to freeze the water but not so quickly as to freeze off\n the tip of that ice cube spike. Number two, distilled water seems to work better than tap water because even small concentrations of salt prevent spike formation. Number three, a fan in the freezer seems to help spike formation by increasing the circulation of the air and\n When looking at these structures, it's interesting to\n that they only form because of water's unique property of expanding when it freezes. If water didn't expand when it froze, the whole earth would be dramatically different. Because, well, since ice is less dense, it forms on the surface and\n actually insulates the water underneath so it remains liquid and allows life to survive in it. But if instead ice were denser than water it would sink to the bottom, allowing for further cooling of that water and more ice formation.\n And the ice would build up from the bottom upwards, giving less and less water for organisms to live in, until if cold conditions persisted for long enough, all bodies of water would completely solidify as ice, meaning that virtually\n no life could live in them. And at that point the earth would also be completely white, so it would reflect more of the sun's light into space, leading to further cooling. So if water didn't expand when it froze, the whole earth\n would be a cold, lifeless snowball. But it all depends on your starting conditions. Because if there wasn't very much ice on the earth to begin with, it would all sink to the bottom of bodies of water, including arctic sea ice.\n ice. And that means the Earth's surface would be less reflective, so it would absorb more heat from the sun and it would get a lot warmer. So if ice didn't float, if ice was denser than water, either the Earth would be\n much colder than it is now or much hotter than it is now. And in either case, life on Earth might not exist. But if it did, we wouldn't be able to make ice cube spikes.\n Veritasio, an Element of Truth\n you"

And I'm going to ask people to compare their temperatures. Which one do you think will feel warmer? The book?\n Or the hard drive the temperatures. Yeah, tell me if one is hotter or colder or if they're the same temperature How do they feel this is slightly cooler than this one? Yeah, that's former. Yeah Yeah, agree. I'd say the hard drive is a lot colder than the book. I\n I don't know, because the books got more knowledge? Why do you think that is? Metals normally a little bit chillier if you leave it in a colder temperature. Well, what if I said that they're both at the same temperature? What would you say? So you're lying.\n Really? I think you're lying, yeah. Oh, geez. Well, maybe the way I can prove it is I have an infrared thermometer. What do you think we're going to see? I think science might be able to answer that. I don't know about scientists. Make a prediction for me. I still think that that's cool.\n Did you bet me money? I did because I don't have any cash. Let's measure the temperature of the book. What do you see? 19.0. Okay, measure the temperature of that. 19.0.\n Well, now I believe you. I'm trying to actually figure it out actually trying to figure out why they'll be the same temperature They don't feel the same temperature though. So why does that feel colder if they're basically the same? Good one. You got the answer? Well, I'm coming to you guys for answers. We're creatives not engineers.\n Well, I'll try to answer that question with another little experiment. Here is an aluminium block and a plastic block.\n How do their temperatures compare? Completely different. Completely different. It's much colder. Yeah. Yeah? This actually feels colder. Let's take this to the next level. I'm going to put an ice cube on both plates. What are we going to see? Well, I'm guessing it would stay...\n solid on this one and melt on this one. So it's going to melt on the plastic but stay solid on the aluminium. Yes, but maybe I'm wrong. That one will melt more quickly than on the aluminium block. I think so, I think they're colder. Yeah, because it's cold. And I think they're gonna go\n the same. Alright, so we put an ice cube on each of those blocks. Wow. What are you seeing? Well, it is melting a lot quicker on the aluminium. I got it melting. This is melting quicker than that one, even though this is aluminium that's pasting. So which one felt colder? This one. How does that make any sense?\n I have no idea, you know. Could aluminium be bad for the environment? How would aluminium be bad for the environment? Well, it's thawing out the ice a lot quicker, isn't it? So you want the answer? Yes. Yes, please, please! It's about thermal conductivity, right? The rate at which heat is transferred.\n from one object to another. So when you felt these blocks originally, I know this one felt a lot colder, but you know from the other example we did that they must both be at the same temperature, because they've both been outside for a while. We see that the aluminium block is melting the ice faster than\n the plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster. With the plastic block it's a worse thermal conductor so heat is being transferred less quickly to this ice block and so it's staying ice. Okay, I believe you. Makes sense?\n Yes, definitely. You know, in our first example, the hard drive felt colder even though it was at the same temperature roughly as the book. And that's because the aluminium conducts heat away from your hand faster than the book conducts heat away from your hand. Sure, that seems logical.\n It makes the hard drive feel colder and the book feel warmer. So when you touch something, you don't actually feel temperature. You feel the rate at which heat is conducted either towards or away from you. Think about this next time you hop out of the shower in winter.\n It's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than on the tile beside it. Not because the bath mat is warmer, but because it conducts heat less quickly away from you."

            "transcription": "Today I'm doing an experiment that demonstrates Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. So here I have a green laser and I'm firing it down towards the front of the room through a narrow slit. Now that slit can be adjusted so it can be made narrow.\n narrower or wider, and the laser spot is projected onto a screen behind it. So what do you think is going to happen to this spot on the screen as I narrow the slit? Well let's have a look. You see exactly what you'd expect. The spot\n gets narrower and narrower, the sides are getting cut off by the slit, makes complete sense, and if you stop there, you would never realize that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is at work. But if you keep going, something strange happens.\n As you make the slit even narrower, the spot starts to spread out. Isn't that incredible? You're making the slit narrower and yet the spot on the wall is getting wider.\n The narrower you make it, the wider that spot on the wall becomes. To understand this, we have to look at Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is normally written as delta x delta p is greater than or equal to\n to h on 4 pi. So what does this mean? Well it's about the position and the momentum of a particle. So x is the position of the particle and p is its momentum. So delta x is the uncertainty in position and delta p is\n is\n it's just a very small number. So in our everyday lives we don't come up against this uncertainty relation because everything is much, much bigger than H. But as we narrowed the slit, we were decreasing delta X for those photons.\n So we were getting more and more precise about where the photons were passing through that slit. And at a certain point, you come to this limit, so that if you narrow this any further, you're going to break this uncertainty relationship.\n to happen is the uncertainty in momentum needs to go up. I should specify this is uncertainty in momentum in the x direction, in the horizontal direction. So if before photons were going perfectly straight, now they must veer off to the left or to the\n the right to ensure that we don't break Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. And the more you decrease your uncertainty in position, the more narrow you make that slit, the more the uncertainty in momentum has to go up. And so if these\n photons are going to the left and the right, that's going to produce a much wider beam. It's really, really non-intuitive, but it's the way the world works.\n I've got to say a big thank you to Professor Walter Lewin at MIT. He inspired me to make\n this video. And I also have to say a big thanks to the University of Sydney for letting me use their equipment and especially to Tom and Ralph for helping me set this all up. Oh, and just one more thing. I should point out that this explanation of the experiment is slightly controversial.\n At least in that, Henry from MinutePhysics and I have been debating whether it's really that counterintuitive. I mean, if you see light as a wave, then all light is doing here is diffracting. That's the phenomenon where if a wave passes through a slit, it bends at the corners\n and radiates out in all directions, and that explains the spreading of the beam. But that goes to the very nature of light. Is it made of waves or particles? That's something that I would like to explore in the coming weeks, so stay tuned for that. But Henry has an excellent video about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle,\n which I think makes it more intuitive and less spooky. So if you wanna check that out, click on the annotation. It's a really good video."

            "transcription": "So, you want to see water freeze almost immediately? Well here's what you're going to need. Some very pure water. Fiji water has been recommended to me by a friend. And obviously we're going to need a freezer.\n some way to cool it down. So I'm going to put this bottle of water in the freezer in the area normally occupied by the ice cube trays because I think that might be the coldest part of my freezer. I've got two bottles just in case\n one doesn't work. And now we have to wait. There are lots and lots of videos showing this phenomena on YouTube, but very few that explain how it actually works, so I'd like to take a minute and do that. Water is\n is\n They're not rolling over each other and moving past each other so they can no longer flow. They're solid. Now what we're doing here is super cooling the water. So we're taking it below its temperature, below zero degrees, where it should become ice. But it's very difficult\n for that water to make the transition without somewhere for that ice crystal to start growing. So what we need is some kind of nucleation event. If the water is not pure, the impurities in the water naturally act\n sites where the crystal can start forming. That's why it's very important that we use very very pure water. Another way we can cause this nucleation event is to bang the water bottle. Hopefully that will cause a few water molecules to line up in the\n right way and that will seed the rest of the ice crystal. So let's give it a few hours and we'll come back and try to nucleate this ice forming event. Alright, it's taken a few days and multiple attempts.\n But I think this could finally be it. I might have finally created supercooled water. So let's find out. I'm going to take the water very carefully out of the freezer. And now you can see\n clearly that the water is still liquid. You can see this air bubble floating around. And now I'm going to bang it on the counter and we will see if we can get an ice crystal to form. Whoa!\n Oh look at that, you can see that ice crystal growing right down from the top to the bottom. So there you have it, I was finally able to demonstrate the super cooled water phenomenon. I cooled down the very pure water in my\n freezer for 2 or 3 hours and then by banging the water bottle on the counter I started the formation of an ice crystal at the top of the bottle of water which quickly grew down to the bottom. Now performing this experiment was a lot more difficult\n than I anticipated. I did this at least eight times with about five different bottles of water and I only managed to catch it on tape once. So it was a real challenge. Things I learned were that you can't leave the water in the freezer too long otherwise\n it will freeze up on its own accord and also you have to be very careful when pulling the water out of the freezer that you don't bump it because otherwise it will start freezing right away before you have a chance to to bang it on the counter. So give it a try and\n and see if you can make it work."

Now the trouble was he couldn't actually do the experiment, so he had to use his imagination. He had to do a thought experiment.\n to figure out what a reasonable outcome would be.\n Einstein's intuition told him that the world should feel the same in all frames of reference moving with constant velocity. These are called inertial frames of reference. So it doesn't matter\n if you're in a train or on a plane or in a car or in a room. As long as you're moving with constant velocity, the laws of physics should apply in exactly the same way. And this is what's called the principle of relativity. Is there a speed limit?\n the universe? I don't think so. So you can go as fast as you want? Probably. Could we go as fast as light? Sure, eventually, absolutely. Can you compare the speed of sound and the speed of light? It's however many times quicker, isn't it, because you've got the...\n Lighting and thunder. Roughly how much quicker is light? Ten times. Roughly ten times? Ten times? I think it's a ten or a hundred, I don't know. Something like that. The answer for you is a million. Oh. Light is a million times faster than sound. Perhaps thought or...\n Thought is faster than light. Yeah, it's immediate. It's there. Let's do a little thought experiment. Let's say I'm on a train traveling the speed of light that way. Who am I kidding? This is City Rail. We're lucky to be moving. But let's use our imagination.\n So let's say I'm traveling at the speed of light this way. If I hold up a mirror in front of my face, will I be able to see my reflection? Do you see the problem? In order for me to see my reflection, light has to bounce off my face and travel to the mirror.\n But if the mirror is going forwards at the speed of light, how is the light ever going to catch up? So a logical answer would be that no, you can't see your face in a mirror when you're on a train traveling at the speed of light.\n violates the principle of relativity because it means that I can tell I'm in a frame of reference that's going at the speed of light that way. Ah crap, not again. So let's consider the other option. Maybe I do see my reflection, which means the light must travel from my face\n to the mirror at its regular speed, the speed of light. But now the problem is someone outside the train would see light traveling at twice the speed of light. Because I'm already traveling at the speed of light and the light is traveling at the speed of light relative to me.\n If that makes any sense. So that leads to a really inconsistent answer. Because how can the speed of light be twice the speed of light in that frame of reference? So Einstein's conclusion was that I must see my reflection because otherwise it violates\n the principle of relativity. But in order for me inside the train to measure the same speed of light as someone outside the train, the train must actually contract in the direction that it's moving, and my time must tick by slower relatively\n relative to someone outside. So Einstein changed what we thought were absolutes, space and time, and made something that seemed like it should be relative, the speed of light, into the true universal constant. So what would it look like to\n travel alongside a beam of light? Well, according to Einstein, we'll never know, because we can't go that fast. At that speed, our length would become zero, time would stop relative to an outside observer, and perhaps worst of all,\n our mass would become infinite. But a recent experimental result has suggested that neutrinos can go faster than light. Still, most physicists think that, well, this result probably won't hold up to scrutiny, because the principle of relativity is just\n just so well established nowadays. But who knows, perhaps one day we'll find a way to break what we thought was the universal speed limit, the speed of light."

If an atom were as wide as your arm span, then the electrons would all be whizzing about inside the volume enclosed by your fingertips. Meanwhile,\n The nucleus would be sitting in the center and its diameter would be smaller than the width of a single human hair. So all of the atoms that make up you and me and all the seemingly solid things in the universe are mostly\n empty space. Now this is incredible, but what is even more mind-boggling is that empty space is not truly empty. I know because I've seen it. This is a simulation by Professor Derek Lineweber at the University\n University of Adelaide. It was made using a supercomputer to crunch the calculations of quantum chromodynamics. Now that is the theory of fundamental particles called quarks, the building blocks of protons and neutrons and how they interact\n with each other through gluons.\n And what we see is a bubbling soup of quantum field fluctuations that come and go incredibly quickly. The frame rate of this simulation is 1 million\n billion billion frames per second. Now that is truly high speed. The dimensions of this box are absolutely tiny. They are millionths of a billionth of a meter. Roughly enough space to stick two\n protons. But there are no protons here. This is a simulation of the vacuum on its own, what we normally think of as empty space.\n On average, it is possible to annihilate a quark from empty space because it's not empty. That just sounds like the most ridiculous idea that you're meant to have empty space and yet you can go and get rid of stuff from it.\n Now it seems counterintuitive that the vacuum at its lowest energy state should contain all of this stuff, but in fact to clear out the fluctuations and create a truly empty vacuum would require a lot of effort.\n lot of energy.\n into something where the vacuum is actually full of quantum field fluctuations. Well this may not be as strange as it first appears. I mean consider a permanent magnet. It has a magnetic field around it at low energy at room temperature.\n And that's because the individual little magnetic moments of all the atoms inside are lined up. But if you were to heat it up, you would give thermal energy to all those particles, and at a certain point, called the Curie temperature, they would be so randomly aligned that there would\n no longer be an overall magnetic field, so it actually takes energy to get rid of the permanent magnetic field. This is just like the quantum vacuum. And understanding how the quantum vacuum fluctuations work gives us\n a sense of what the fundamental particles do, like where are you most likely to find a quark?\n So we like to think of the corks hopping from one lump over to the next lump as it appears and then on to another one. I like to think of it as a hiker trying to cross a stream that's running around every now and then a stone pops up.\n So while it is true that\n that you and I and all of the other atoms in the universe are mostly empty space, it is also true that empty space isn't truly empty. And in fact it is these vacuum fluctuations which are essential for our existence.\n If you're not subscribed to Derek's channel, Baratossium, I don't know what you're doing with your life.

An electric\n magnet. But how does this work? Well, strangely enough, it's a consequence of special relativity.\n moving relative to each other, hence relativity. For example, if you measure carefully enough, you'll find that time passes slower for observers moving relative to you. Hey Derek, when did you last shave?\n And moving objects are also contracted in their direction of motion.\n than when it's not moving. And even though this effect is obviously way tinier than we've shown, length contraction is what makes an electromagnet work. Picture a copper wire. It consists of positive metal ions swimming in a sea of free negative electrons.\n Now the number of protons is equal to the number of negative electrons so overall the wire is neutral. So if there were a positive charge or positively charged cat nearby it would experience no force from the wire at all and even if there were a current in the wire the electrons\n would just be drifting in one direction but the density of positive and negative charges would still be the same and so the wire would be neutral so no force on the kitty. But what if the cat starts moving? Imagine for simplicity that the cat is moving in\n the same direction as the electrons with the same velocity. Well now, in my frame of reference, the wire is still neutral and so there should be no force on the cat. But consider the same situation in her frame of reference. In the cat's frame of reference, the positive charges in the wire are\n moving, so according to special relativity, their separation will be ever so slightly contracted. Also, from this perspective, the electrons aren't moving, so they'll be more spread out than before. Remember, objects take up more space when they're not moving than when they are. These two changes together mean there's a\n But in my frame of reference, this seems mysterious. There's no force on a stationary charged\n cat, but a moving cat is somehow repelled from this neutral wire. How do you account for that force? Well, we say it is the magnetic force, and that's mainly because a wire with current in it deflects nearby magnets. So really,\n Basically what this experiment shows is that a magnetic field is just an electric field viewed from a different frame of reference. In the cat's frame of reference, it is repelled from the wire due to the electric field created by the excess positive charges produced by the effects of length contraction.\n the cat is repelled from a neutral wire due to the magnetic field created by the current flowing in the wire. So whether you see it as an electric or a magnetic field just depends on your frame of reference, but in either case the results are the same. So an electromagnet is an everyday example\n of special relativity in action. Now that might seem crazy since electrons drift through wires at about 0.00000000001% the speed of light. So how can special relativity have anything to do\n Well the truth is there are enough electrons in a wire and the electric interaction is so amazingly strong that even the minuscule effects of length contraction can produce significant charge imbalances that produce a noticeable force.\n Yeah, I mean there can't be electrical currents flowing around inside lumps of rock, can there?

            "transcription": "At the Palace of Discovery in Paris, they have this huge turntable where you can sit and perform experiments. Like in the middle of the turntable, you can put some water and then add liquid nitrogen. And this creates a kind of fog, these tiny water droplets that spread out from the middle. But because the actual linear\n speed of this turntable is increasing the further out you go, well the vapor falls further and further behind creating a swirl that looks a little bit like a hurricane. And that analogy is not by accident. The earth is after all one giant turntable and the weather patterns we get are a result of that. When you\n If you study physics in rotating frames of reference or even just rotating bodies, you find some pretty mysterious and counterintuitive phenomena, which is why I'm dedicating this video to four revolutionary riddles. Number one. Here I have a ramp or an inclined plane and just to show you I'm not doing anything funny with it.\n If I just let a roll of tape go it will accelerate down the ramp, but here I have a mystery cylinder and I'm gonna place that on the ramp and we will see that it rolls and then it stops and then it rolls and then stops\n So my question to you is, what is in the mystery cylinder? What is this object? Number two, take a bicycle and have someone support it so it doesn't fall over or lean it up against something. And then take a bit of string and tie it to the bottom pedal.\n Now what I'm going to do is pull backwards horizontally on this string and I want you to predict what the bike will do. Will it go backwards, forwards, or will it just stay there and not move? My intuition would tell me that it would go forward. I think it might not move. If you're going to be pulling backwards,\n backwards from a stationary point on the pedal you're going to be pulling it backwards just as the pedals are trying to spin the wheels forward so maybe it might not move. I think it's going to go forward. I'll go with forward. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Alright. 3, 2, 1. Number 3. I want you to think\n about running two laps of this track. Now the first lap you can go as slowly as you like. Let's call that speed V1. But on your second lap, I want you to run faster such that the total average speed for both laps combined is twice V1, twice the speed of your first lap. So the question for you is\n how fast you have to run that second lap so that your total average speed is 2 v 1. Number four. Anytime a train is moving, either slowly or very fast, there is a part of the train which is actually moving backwards with respect to the ground. That is not backwards.\n with respect to the train and it doesn't have to be going so slowly that if you ran backwards you would be going backwards with respect to the ground. It is at any speed, any normal train will have a part of it which is moving backwards with respect to the ground. My question to you is which part is it?\n Now, with these four riddles, you can make me a video response if you like to tell me about your solutions to them, or you can simply leave your answers in the comments below and number them one, two, three, four so we know which ones you're talking about.

            "transcription": "Five fun physics phenomena. Number one, have a friend hold a cane out horizontally for you or another similar object and putting your two index fingers together try to place them underneath the center of mass. When they let go,\n You will find it doesn't normally work. But now try putting each index finger at opposite ends of the cane and then moving your index fingers in towards the middle. What you will find is that they always\n end up right under the center of mass of the cane. You can try starting off asymmetrically and they will still end up under the center of mass. You can try going at different speeds\n speeds really slowly or really fast, but you still end up\n How does this work? Number two, the phone flip. Have you ever tried to spin your phone? If you do it in this direction, it's pretty easy. It stays nicely aligned. If you spin it along its short axis,\n you'll also find it spins very well. But if you try to flip your phone end over end like this, you can't do it cleanly. The phone will never flip simply end over end without also rotating in one of the other directions.\n Even when I make an almost perfect flip, instabilities grow until the phone rotates around another axis. Why can't... No, I still can't do it.\n Why is it so? Number three. You've probably seen that if you rub a cup on your hair you can make it electrically charged and if you bring it close to a stream of water you can actually cause that stream to deflate.\n Now usually this is used in chemistry textbooks as a demonstration of the polar nature of water. Water is a molecule with a more positive side and a more negative side. And so what happens, so you're told, is that the water molecule flips around so the positive\n side of the water faces the negative side of the cup and that is what attracts the water to the cup. But this is not the real explanation. If you have a uniform electric field there is an equal force pulling the positive side towards it as there is\n pushing the negative side away from it. And so you can't actually do more than just turn the molecules. You would need a really, really strong gradient in your electric field to make this work at all, and it basically is just not gonna happen from a cup.\n So why is the stream actually attracted to a charged cup? That is the question. Number four. Take a piece of your favorite cereal and drop it into a bowl of water. Then, using a very strong magnet,\n try to pull the cereal around. Isn't that cool? So why is cereal magnetic? And finally five, the tea bag\n rocket. Take a tea bag and cut off the sealed end very carefully. Now dump out the tea. Form the tea bag into a square\n column and balance it on the plate. Now light the top of the tea bag on fire. Try to light it evenly on all sides.\n Get ready for takeoff in three, two, one. Ha, yeah! That is the beauty of the teabag rocket. So why did that happen?\n So, how do all of these phenomena work? Let me know in the comments, or make a video explaining any or all of them. Or, subscribe to the channel and I'll post the answers next week.\n I hope you enjoyed those fun physics phenomena. I know a guy who would, the former commander of the International Space Station, Commander Chris Hatfield. I'm actually hosting live events with him in late August in Sydney and Canberra. I am so looking forward\n to that. Now the Sydney shows are all sold out but there are still as of now tickets to the Canberra show so if you want to come to that check out the link in the description.

            "transcription": "What is a force? Seems to be an idea that a lot of people are confused about. It's like Star Wars is the only source of knowledge. What is a force? Um, it's like, did you die?\n A force is how you raise X-Wings out of swamps. You just concentrate. What would you say a force is? Other than Jedis. But outside of Star Wars, a force\n is energy and mass. So if you have a huge thing moving really fast you've got a lot of force. It's like getting hit by a truck as opposed to getting hit by this tennis ball. Force is energy.\n that comes from somewhere. Something that exerts energy on all other matter. The movement. The movement of something in one direction.\n and the atmosphere. I don't know, it's this indescribable thing that kind of keeps us from flying off into space. Nobody really knows what it's about, it's just a theoretical\n And that should teach me to interview philosophy students. But contrary to what she said, there were some people who knew what force was about. Something that makes something move from its original position.\n you propel something or how you get something to move or how to reshape something? It's a kind of attraction or direction or something like that. That an object has on it. Yeah. Push. Yeah.\n Okay, it took some coaching, but force is essentially just a push or a pull. So then I asked people what forces are acting on you right now.\n Most could identify a downward gravitational force towards the center of the earth, but then things got a little bit hazy. Can you tell me about the forces on you at the moment? Well, probably there's a big force down below.\n towards the center of the earth. Which is? That's gravity, what we call gravity I guess. Well the gravity of earth. Where is it, how does it act on you? Well it keeps me on the earth, I just, I don't fly away. I would be standing\n on the earth and it's pulling me down and making sure that I'm stuck to the earth. What other forces are on you? Are there any other forces on you? There are. There's air pressure forces around me. There's my own muscular forces keeping me up. My skeletal forces, those kind of things. And also there's\n than different weather or climatic conditions. In terms of wind, weather, that sort of thing, or just normal gravity. This is what's keeping me on the ground, isn't that gravity? So there's a gravity\n Gravitational force pulling you down. Any other forces that are acting on you? Friction. Like on me right now? On you right now. I can't think of anything except gravity. Only one force. Surely there's like a lot of small ones but... Let me put this to you.\n If there's only one force on an object, what does it do? It goes towards it. But there's another force acting on you, which is a pretty important one. Because there's a force acting down, right? There's a gravitational force. What about a force acting up?\n No up forces? Not that I can think of. Okay, so what forces are acting on you right now?"

            "transcription": "In my last video I showed you five fun physics phenomena and asked you how they work. You responded with thousands of comments and some video responses. Well here are my explanations. Let's start with a serial because it seems the simplest\n but it turns out to be one of the most surprising. The simple explanation goes like this. So I showed you cereal is magnetic. I have ground up all of this cereal into a very fine powder. Let us see what is in it.\n I'm going to take these strong magnets and run them over the cereal powder and see if anything is attracted to them. Look how the cereal actually sticks to the magnet. It's because there's pieces of iron in this cereal.\n They've been added because iron is something we need. It's an essential nutrient that we need to survive. In fact, this cereal has 60% of your recommended daily intake of iron. But there's more to it. I received a video response from Martin\n air, showing non-magnetic objects like plastic and paper also apparently being attracted to a magnet. So how does this work? Well water is diamagnetic, which means in the presence of a magnetic field, it generates its own magnetic field in the\n opposite direction. This means the water is very slightly repelled by the magnet, and this causes a depression in the surface of the water into which a floating object will slide. You can even see this depression by looking at the reflections off the water.\n So cereal is attracted to a magnet due to its iron content, but when floating on the surface of water there is an additional effect, the depression of the water's surface due to its diamagnetism.\n I showed you that you can find the center of mass of a cane or another stick type object just by moving your fingers in towards the middle from the outside. But how does this work? Even when you start in say an asymmetric position? Well, one finger is closer to the center of mass.\n and therefore it carries more of the weight of the cane. And so the friction force between your finger and the cane is greater until the point where the other finger catches up, which point this finger slides in and eventually they must meet in the middle.\n So this is a way you can find the center of mass of any cane or cane-like object. I showed you that if you try to flip your phone end over end, there is no way to do it without it also rotating around the short axis as well.\n Why is that? The phone has three axes about which it can rotate. There is the long axis, which has the maximum moment of inertia, meaning it requires the most torque to accelerate it in that direction. Spinning about the short axis,\n has the least moment of inertia, then there is the intermediate axis which has a moment of inertia in between the other two. Now the intermediate axis theorem says that if you try to flip any object along its intermediate axis it will not maintain simply that rotation.\n It will also get rotations in any of the other directions. That is, if there is any slight deviation from a perfect rotation. So why does this happen? Well, the mathematics is kind of complicated, but it's similar to the mathematics of a rigid pendulum.\n So, if you're flipping the phone along its long axis or its short axis, the phone acts a little bit like this pendulum in that any perturbation will cause it simply to go back to where it was before. But, if you're flipping it along its intermediate axis, it's as though you're trying to\n balance the pendulum on its end, in which case it's very unstable and any slight perturbation may cause it to exponentially increase. So that is why you can't just flip your phone along its intermediate axis with\n at it also spinning along one of the other axes. I showed you that an electrically charged object can deflect a stream of water, but it is not due to the common explanation, the common reason which is given, which is that water is a polar molecule.\n So what really is causing this water to be attracted towards the cup? Well, it is charges, but it is ions. It is dissolved ions in the water. There will be some OH ions, some H plus ions, and there will also be some\n other impurity ions in the water. So what happens when you hold this negatively charged cup up against the water stream is it will repel the negative charges, the negative ions in the water, some of which will go back up into the tap. And that means the water coming down\n will be slightly positively charged. And once it breaks up into droplets, those droplets have a positive charge that they can't get rid of. So now those positive droplets are attracted to the negatively charged cup, and you can see those droplets swirling around the cup because they are\n so\n In the teabag rocket, we showed that if you light a teabag on fire from the top, it will\n actually take off into the air. That happens because as the teabag is burning, all the air inside it heats up and so it expands so it gets less dense and it's pushed up by all the cooler air around it. You know sometimes people talk about how\n hot air rises. I mean, that is what hot air does, but only because the cooler air around it is pushing it up. In essence, it's like a buoyant force because the hot air is now less dense than the cooler air around it. So when the teabag burns right down to the bottom, the\n The remaining ash is so light that it gets swept up in that convection current and you get a teabag rocket. So do you agree with all of my explanations and did you get them right the first time? Let me know in the comments.\n and thanks for watching!"

            "transcription": "So my question to you is, let's say the wind is coming from over there, I want you to position the boat in whatever direction you think will make it go the fastest, and how would you set it up? And then you can set the sail how you want, something like that.\n You want to point the boat this way? What would you want to do? So how do most people think a sailboat works? What would you say? Most people think a sailboat gets some wind and manages to move. They don't really know. Or maybe they like get some\n push from behind. Yeah, the pushing by behind is somewhat easy to visualize. Your fastest direction would be straight forward. We'd be going with the wind. Yeah, with the wind. I want you to talk to me about what the wind is doing to the boat here to make it go forwards. Well, with the wind behind, okay.\n pushing to the sail. Pushes against the sail. And it pushes the sailboat forward. So the slowest way to position your boat is? Well the slowest is straight into the wind because you're not generating any lift. And the second slowest, like the slowest act\n actually sailing? It would probably be close to dead away because you're very limited to... So the wind's coming from the back and you just got your sails full out? Yeah, because when you're going directly away from the wind, your boat wind cancels out the actual wind.\n You can actually never exceed it. You would only be able to match and you would have nothing, no force in your sails. But that would only be enough for... But you're just matching the wind. But that would be frictionless too, which couldn't happen. Could you say up wind? Probably.\n with difficulty very slowly that's doing this a little zigzag how does it go forwards if the wind is coming from here how do you get it you'd have to bring it right round like that to bring it\n the side and then flick it right back round to bring it in against the wind as you go. That's how I've seen the boats go. So I'm trying to figure out what could make the boat go forwards if the wind's coming from that side. Do you know what I mean? An engine.\n Which way is the force on these sails? What do you think? I think it tends to be a little back and sidewards. The force is back\n and sideways. How does the boat go forwards? Yeah, it's okay but then, well, again. I know it does, but again, don't have all the answers. So how does a sailboat move? The sails actually act like wings, generating high and low pressure on each\n side. You generate high pressure on the inside of your sail and low pressure on the outside. So the air is going faster around the outside. Right, it has a longer way to travel in a sense, right? Okay. And then you generate a bit of lift. So the lift will actually end up being in kind of\n this direction towards me. Which is mostly sideways and a little bit forward. It is mostly sideways and a little bit forwards, but that's why we need to have the centerboard and rudder. They kind of counteract that force because they generate high and low pressure as well as the boat's trying to be pushed sideways.\n It kind of balances it out so the boat goes forwards. Okay, but it seems like I mean if the there's a force pushing that way on the sail and the opposite way on the centerboard it seems like the whole thing would tend to... It would absolutely try and turn over and which is why the body weight\n in the leverage of the people is so important. How can a sailboat go faster than the wind? Because it can generate more pressure by its motion.\n Okay. Right? Like, it's, there's only, it can actually happen quite easily in light wind because let's say you only have three knots going this way and then you generate a knot of motion. Well, all of a sudden you're sailing with more than three knots of breeze over your\n sails and then I can build and compound on itself. The limiting factor is the drag on the hull. And the drag on the sails actually. That's actually very large as well. So in fact the fastest way to sail a boat is not downwind, it's actually kind of\n Like 90 degrees or 45 degrees to the wind or something like that. That makes the boat go faster. Okay. Thank you very much. You're very welcome. I hope you enjoyed this video on the physics of sailing. If you want to see more with Hunter, click the first link.

            "transcription": "Today I'm going to bake this chocolate cake. Now those of you who know me know that the only reason I would do this is to prove a point. Earlier I was asking people to compare the temperatures of these two objects. A science book written by Isaac\n Asimov and an old metal hard drive. Can you compare their temperatures? Yeah, that feels colder. Cold and nice from temperature. You would say colder than that one. Yeah. What makes something hotter\n or colder. What affects that? The actual material. I mean, paper is warm and metal is cold. Both of these objects have been sitting here on the ground for quite a while. So one might expect that they're at the same temperature. No, because this is a\n metal and that's paper. But what if I left that outside all day? Would it be 15 degrees? No, because paper doesn't absorb cold. Doesn't absorb cold? No. Well I've left books out not all day.\n outdoors and I can't say that I've noticed the book was cold when I've come to pick it up. Ever. What if I told you that these two objects are actually the same temperature? What would you say? Definitely not. If it's the temperature right now, this is colder. So let's say\n you're taking a cake out of the oven, would you be worried about touching the cake? Yes, well not the cake itself but the actual tin around the cake because it will be hot. Yeah but how does the temperature of the tin compare to the temperature of the cake? Well the cake will be warm\n warm, like hot, but not as hot as a tin. The tin's hotter because it's metal. Metal of metal holds the heat longer and holds the cold longer. You don't think the tin would be the same temperature as the cake? Well, you think it's, if it's being like in 200 degrees Celsius, it would probably be the same, but it's somehow\n It just doesn't feel like it will burn with metal, whereas my fingers will burn. But I mean, not if I stick my finger in the cake, it wouldn't burn as much. Alright, it's time to take the cake out and find out if it's the same temperature as the tin. I have a meat thermometer with which to measure the temperature.\n the cake. I'm not sure that's the most accurate way of doing it, but well, it's the only thing I've got. So let's give it a shot. So I tried to measure the temperature of the cake using a meat thermometer, but unfortunately its temperature scale doesn't go high enough to allow me to accurately measure the temperature.\n of the cake. You can actually hear the moment when I realized that my experiment wasn't going to work. Uh oh. So now I'm back in Vancouver and I thought I'd bring in the big guns to help me sort out this experiment. And by the big guns I\n of course mean my mom. So Derek, I understand we're gonna make this vanilla cake mix together and see what happens. We've got a secret weapon which is this infrared thermometer which can measure temperatures up to 300 degrees\n Celsius, so we should have no problems with it. We just point it at a surface and it gives us a readout of the temperature of that surface. So this should be perfect for measuring the temperature of the cake and the tin. Do you want to make a prediction about the relative temperatures of\n of the cake and the tin when we bring it out of the oven? Well, I really suspect that the tin is going to be a lot hotter than the cake. You can really not handle the tin at all. So I reckon that's what's going to happen. Okay. Well, I think they're both going to be the same temperature, but I could be\n wrong so we're gonna have to do the experiment and find out. All right let's get mixing. Okay so it's been about a half an hour and the cake is cooked, it's ready to come out. Yeah we're all ready to go. That is your your expert opinion as the master\n baker here? Yes, I think so. Okay, we're gonna take the cake out of the oven and we're going to check the temperature of the tin and the cake. Let's do it. Okay. Oh, it looks like a good cake. Yeah, not a bad one. Okay, so let's\n measure the temperature of the cake we have 108.9 and the temperature of the tin 118.6 but dropping over here 108.1 so we have what would you say about the\n temperature of the cake and the tin? Pretty close. Much closer than I expected. They're quite similar. They're both around 110 Celsius. That's my point is that the tin and the cake are the same temperature but the tin is going to conduct\n heat to your hand much faster than the cake. So the tin would burn you but the cake would not. But they're the same temperature. What if I were to impress upon you that they are in fact the same temperature? I'll take your word for it. And that in fact that these two are the same temperature? No, I don't agree with that.\n You don't think there's a different temperature no really I just can't believe this book is 15 degrees. It just doesn't feel it In truth, there's no difference in the temperature between these two objects if they've been in the same surroundings for a long time\n period of time, they come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings, which means they're both at the same temperature. But the metal feels colder because it's able to conduct heat away from my hand faster than the book. So just because an object feels colder, that doesn't mean that it actually\n has a lower temperature. It may just mean that it's conducting heat away from your hand faster."

            "transcription": "Previously on Veritasium, we saw how our understanding of light has changed over the centuries. In the late 1600s, Huygens proposed that light was a type of wave, while Newton considered it a stream of particles. This debate appeared to be settled in 1801 by Young's double slit experiment, which showed light passing through two slits produced patterns like water waves.\n But by 1900 it was clear that light energy was not evenly distributed as expected for a wave. Rather on the smallest scales it comes in lumps called quanta or photons. So the question is, how does this affect the double slit experiment? Here I have a more contained double slit experiment where there is a laser which fires a beam through a single slit.\n through a double slit and onto a screen where you can see a well-defined interference pattern. There's a series of bright and dark bands which are much easier to observe than when I use sunlight because with only one wavelength there are no other colors involved. This is what a graph of intensity versus position would look like for the interference pattern. What creates that pattern?\n consider the bright spot in the middle. The light from each slit has to travel the same distance to reach that point and hence both waves arrive in phase. That means crests with crests and troughs with troughs. So they add together and create an interference maximum, a bright spot. But if you look slightly to the left, there's a dark spot. Now that's because light\n The light from one slit has to travel on an angle and it has to travel an extra half a wavelength compared to the light from the other slit. Which means when this light is arriving as a crest, the light from the other slit is arriving as a trough. And so they cancel each other out. But if you go further left you see another bright spot.\n the light from one of the slits has to travel a full extra wavelength compared to the light from the other slit and so again they arrive in phase. Crest with crests and troughs with troughs creating constructive interference and so we see a bright spot of light and that's how the whole pattern is created. But what if I decrease the intensity so much that there wasn't a whole wave of light\n going through there. There were only single photons. Then how could they interfere with each other because there's only one in the device at any one time? So would we still see an interference pattern? That is what we're going to find out. In order to make this work I had to line up a very faint source and to see where the light was going I had to shroud\n my head in that black cloth. But I finally have the apparatus ready. You can see up here I have a frequency counter which actually counts the number of photons received per second at the detector. The detector is a photomultiplier tube which is capable of detecting single photons. It's like a very sensitive eye, like the frog's eye. Now right now\n Now there's no light passing through to the detector, but there is still a bit of a background reading, and that's because I can't block all the light out of there, plus there are cosmic rays passing through this room which will also set off the detector. I'm plotting a graph of the number of photons counted as a function of position across the detector. If you have a look after one second,\n the distribution seems random, there doesn't seem to be any pattern in the arrangement of those photons as they hit the detector. So maybe it's true, a single photon can't interfere with itself because it's just a localized point, it has to go through one slit or the other. But just to be sure, let's add up the results over a period of time and see if any pattern\n emerges. Look at that. You can clearly see the same interference pattern that we got when we were sending tons of photons through but we're getting it out of single photons. We're counting up individual photons and that pattern is emerging\n as we aggregate the results over time. But how could this be happening? How could a single photon pass through both slits? Well, if we try to interpret these results in terms of the objects we experience every day, they don't make any sense. A photon is something different to a macro\n microscopic object. It's not a wave and it's not a particle, it's a quantum mechanical object. And sometimes it seems like it has properties of a wave and sometimes it seems like it has properties of a particle, but ultimately it is something totally different to anything we've experienced before. And that's what makes this seem so counterintuitive.\n So what is light, wave or particle? The true answer I think is neither, though if you want you could call it a wavicle. This problem is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other. Where they meet up peaks with peaks\n At the end of the last video, I asked why is it that the interference pattern is made by blobs rather than thin lines of light as it was in this experiment. And in the comments I saw two common answers.\n One was that the blobs were images of the sun, and the other answer was that it was due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Now those were very thin slits, so it's true Heisenberg's uncertainty principle would be involved, and that light passing through each slit would spread out. But the reason we actually saw\n blobs was because they were images of the Sun. So if the sunlight comes through one slit it diffracts out and would spread out onto the bottom of the box and light from the other slit would do exactly the same and where those two spreads overlap is where we saw\n the three main blobs. So there's a diffraction maximum created by one slit and another diffraction maximum created by the other slit and those two overlap. But due to the light being in different phases it cancels out in certain positions creating those separate images of the Sun."

            "transcription": "A couple of years ago, my friend Destin and I wanted to definitively answer the question, does water actually swirl the opposite direction down the drain in the other hemisphere? At the time, I was living in Sydney, Australia, and Destin was in Huntsville, Alabama. Those are about the same latitude, just opposite.\n opposite sides of the equator. So we created two videos that were meant to be watched simultaneously, and if you want to synchronize them yourself, you can click the link in the description. But we also recognized that that was a hassle for some people particularly watching on mobile devices, and that's why I'm now releasing\n this extra wide video of both videos synchronized. The Simpsons did a whole episode based on toilets flushing the opposite direction in Australia. Plus other shows have supposedly demonstrated this effect. So I've seen\n So is this a real effect or not?\n This principle to draining water in Earth's two hemispheres is just bunk.\n Some turn counterclockwise and some go clockwise. This sink sometimes drains one way and sometimes the other way. You see most toilets have little jets in it so the swirl direction is determined by the design of the toilet and not which hemisphere you're in. In any container of water\n there's always going to be some rotation. The water is not perfectly still. And it is this, rather than the hemisphere, that determines which way the water will swirl down the drain. So it's a myth. Crossing the equator does not mean the toilet's going to change directions. But what if\n What if we come into the garage and do a more controlled experiment? But what if we could eliminate all motion from the water? This is a one and a half meter kiddie pool. I have here a five foot wide kiddie pool. Instead of filling the pool with no vorticity at all, I'm going against\n the way it's supposed to drain. So I'm trying to fill it with the flow going clockwise. I actually filled the pool in the anti-clockwise direction to be sure that any clockwise motion we see is not due to the way I filled the pool. So let's let the water settle for a\n sweet day so that we know that it's perfectly still. I've left this water sitting here for 24 hours. So it seems like I've damped all of the motions from the filling. I'm not going to reach in and pull a plug out because that would induce some vorticity. I'm going to use this valve\n that I have connected to the bottom of the pool. I really hope this works. Destin, wish me luck. Good luck Derek. I'm about to pull the plug. Okay, opening the valve in 3, 2, 1.\n Water should be flowing. And the pool is draining. But you can't see any motion of the water just yet. The water's been flowing for a couple of minutes and I haven't seen anything yet so we're gonna put some dye in it. To help us see where the water is flowing I'm gonna put\n some food coloring in on the four cardinal directions around the pool. Check it out, it's like a tornado, like right off the bat. We've got a counter-clockwise rotation. We filled it up clockwise\n And now it's going counterclockwise. You can clearly see that the water is flowing clockwise in this direction and that makes sense because that's how it should flow in the southern hemisphere due to the Earth's rotation. We have a kiddie pool\n in my garage and the whole earth is rotating and the water is going counter-clockwise because I'm in the northern hemisphere. It's real. This is real. But you can see what a tiny little effect it is and what extraordinary lengths I had to go to\n to see this effect. So really, you're not gonna see it in a bathtub and you're not gonna see it in a sink or in a toilet because there are other sources of angular momentum that totally wash out this effect. We just proved it because we just eliminated variables. The Coriolis Effect is real.\n It works! To understand how it works, imagine a pool with one edge touching the South Pole. Think about a pool near the North Pole. The pool is stationary relative to Earth, but every day it's actually completing one full revolution.\n The Earth is spinning on its axis, so the pool spins around the pole once a day. Now you can see the side of the pool furthest from the pole travels much farther every day than the side right next to the pole. The whole pool is moving, but the part that's closest to the equator has more\n momentum, and the part that's closest to the pole has less. So the outer side of the pool is moving fastest towards the east, and as you get closer to the pole, the velocity decreases down to zero. Think about these velocities relative to the drain in the middle.\n Now, imagine we drain the pool. When we pull the plug, all the water starts moving towards the middle. Water from the far side is moving too fast relative to the drain, and so it gets out ahead, whereas water from near the pole is going too slow and\n so it lags behind. The side nearest the equator is going faster, so that water outruns the drain. But the water nearest the pole is going slower, so it falls behind. So when the water approaches the drain, it swirls counterclockwise.\n This is the reason hurricanes swirl counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere. And this is the reason cyclones swirl clockwise in the southern hemisphere. The center of the hurricane has lower pressure, just like a drain. So the hurricane swirls just like our pool.\n The higher pressure air rushes into the eye of the storm and just like in our pool, swirls in the direction dictated by the hemisphere. And that's the truth about toilet swirl. Hey, I hope you enjoyed that and thanks for watching.

            "transcription": "The speed of light is meant to be the ultimate speed limit in the universe. According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, nothing should move through space faster than light. But that doesn't stop people from trying. Every day I get a lot of messages proposing ways to go\n faster than the speed of light. There is the classic method where you shine a laser at the moon. If you can flick that beam across the moon's surface in less than a hundredth of a second, which is not hard to do, then that laser spot will actually move across the surface of the moon faster than the speed of light.\n Imagine what that would look like if you were standing on the moon. If you were quick enough to perceive it, you would see this laser spot move faster than the light coming out of your own laser. How is that even possible? Well, in truth, nothing here is really traveling faster than the speed of light.\n The individual particles of light, the photons coming out of my laser are still traveling to the moon at the speed of light. It's just that they're landing side by side in such quick succession that they form a spot which moves faster than the speed of light, but really it's an illusion. Nothing is actually going faster than that.\n than the speed of light, so you couldn't transmit any information this way. Dan asked, what if instead of a laser, we used a long rigid stick instead? Now surely if you flick your wrist, the tip of the stick must move across the surface of the moon faster than the speed of light.\n Well, unfortunately this won't work either. As we learned in the slinky drop experiment, the fastest a force can propagate through an object is the speed of sound. That's because each atom needs to bump into the one next to it to transmit that force. And this is a lossy process.\n be lucky if any of the energy you put in at the start actually made it to the tip. You'd be lucky if the tip moved at all. Now this is a really sophisticated idea. Girard writes, a very special space age engine would need to be designed that is capable of doing 10,000 plus\n RPM in outer space with very high torque. Consult Elon Musk for this. As the engine is spinning it slowly deploys two very long tethers made from carbon nanotubes on opposing sides. Eventually each carbon nanotube tether reaches an amazing\n length of 285 kilometers. At this point the end of the tether will be traveling at the speed of light. Can you point out some reasons as to why it would not work? Yes Gerard, yes I can. First, any object going in a circle requires a force\n pulling it in towards the middle of that circle. That's called centripetal force and you can feel it when you whirl a ball above your head. Now that force is dependent on the speed of the object squared. So if that gets to be too great the tether breaks. Now if you have\n had a single gram rotating at 99% the speed of light, the amount of force required to pull it towards the center would be 300 mega Newtons. That is the weight of 6,000 fully grown African elephants. But you're right, carbon nanotubes are\n tremendously strong. If you had a fiber just eight centimeters wide you could support all of that force. But now the problem is if you have less than a centimeter of that fiber it adds another gram to the tip of your tether and so now you need a thicker fiber in order to support that additional\n force and that would happen all the way to the base. The fiber would need to get thicker and thicker and thicker all the way back to the motor. And if you do the calculation you find that basically 30 meters from the tip the fiber already has to be as wide as the observable universe in order to support all of that force.\n It's nuts. But it gets worse. As an object moves faster, its inertia actually increases. That means it requires more force to accelerate it. In fact, that 1 gram mass going 99% the speed of light would require 7 times the amount of force we calculated before.\n And so the tether would have to be even thicker. But things get even more problematic if you think about speeding up the tip of the tether that extra 1% to the speed of light. I mean, since the inertia keeps getting greater and greater, it requires more and more force to accelerate it.\n In fact, to speed it up that extra little bit to go the speed of light would require an infinite amount of energy. Okay, well putting the infinite energy aside, let's say we could create an incredible motor and we could find a material much stronger and lighter than carbon nanotubes.\n Is it at least in principle possible that the tip could go faster than light? No. There is one final problem which is insurmountable. Which is that a tether, like anything, is held together by the electromagnetic interaction.\n That is, the attractions between all the tiny little charges that make up the material. Now the problem is, electromagnetism is a force carried by photons. I mean the way that something knows that another thing is there to attract it is by the exchange\n photons these force carrying particles. The problem is the photons themselves move at the speed of light. So even if you could create this incredible apparatus with ridiculously strong materials and spin it up with infinite energy it still wouldn't go the speed of\n light because the force carrying particles that hold the whole thing together only go the speed of light. The speed of light really is the ultimate speed limit in the universe.\n universe.\n of audiobooks with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature from fiction to nonfiction and periodicals.

Well, they're going to hit the ground at the same time. I expect them to both land at the same time. At the same time. At the same time. I think they both will. Well, you would expect this one to hit the ground first. However, they would actually both hit the ground.\n the ground at the same time. Why's that? Science. Now the black one clearly feels a lot heavier. So the standard misconception is to believe that the black ball will accelerate at a greater rate and reach the ground first. This year\n Many people had an idea that both balls would land at the same time, but they didn't know exactly why. I found there were some different misconceptions. For example, many people seem to think that as an object falls towards the earth, it falls with a constant\n speed. From this height, yeah, pretty much. Just a constant speed all the way down speed. Yeah, I think it would be the same constant speed. I think it's constant. I seem to remember it being constant. I did decently in physics and I seem to remember that's the answer. Whereas the truth is...\n The speed of both balls is changing all the time. The balls are speeding up as they go towards the ground. That's what the force of gravity does on them. It makes them accelerate. It gets them to speed up. Another misconception I discovered was that some people believe\n both balls should have the same gravitational force on them even though the black ball is clearly much much heavier. The reason I think they said this was because they knew both balls needed to reach the ground at the same time so they reasoned that the force on them must\n be the same.\n gravitational force around the whole world, right? Because the gravitational pull on the earth is the same on both objects. Are you saying that the force on them is the same? The pull is the same. But you felt the pull and you've told me the pull is different. No, I said the weight is different. I didn't say the pull is different. It is heavier.\n And has more gravitational pull. But when I drop them, then they get equal gravitational pull somehow. Don't you think it's going to be like five times as much? Yeah, you think, but it's not. The way you're asking it, yes, but scientifically speaking, no. It's a gravitational force on both sides.\n Both these balls are the same. The gravitational force on both of these balls is the same. Is that what you actually believe? No, but it is. Tell me what you believe. I believe it should be more on this, simply for the fact that this is heavier and just intuition tells me that it should\n be more but after learning physics we learned that it is actually the same. I actually think the force on this ball is more than the force on this ball. I swear I'm not trying to mess with you. So like in real life?\n In real life and in physics, I will tell you that the force on this ball is more. Alright, ready? 3, 2, 1. I would say the force on the medicine ball is\n like a lot more because it's got a lot more weight, it's got a lot more mass, but it's got a lot more inertia. You guys remember that, right? It's got a lot of resistance to acceleration so it takes more force to get it accelerating at the same rate as this ball.\n And that's why they accelerate at the same rate. Thank you guys so much for playing along. I appreciate that. Sorry, Jared. Oh, it's all right."

            "transcription": "A classical computer performs operations using classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1. Now in contrast, a quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, and they can be both 0 and 1\n at the same time, and it is this that gives a quantum computer its superior computing power. There are a number of physical objects that can be used as a qubit. A single photon, a nucleus, or an electron. I met up with researchers who\n using the outermost electron in phosphorus as a qubit. But how does that work? Well, all electrons have magnetic fields, so they're basically like tiny bar magnets. And this property is called spin. If you place them in a magnetic field, they\n will align with that field just like a compass needle lines up with the magnetic field of the earth. Now this is the lowest energy state so you could call it the zero state or we call it for the electron spin down. Now you can put it in a one state or spin\n up but that takes some energy. If you took out the glass from your compass you could turn the needle the other way but you would have to apply some force to it. You have to push it to flip to the other side and that is the highest energy state.\n In principle, if you were so delicate to really put it exactly against the magnetic field, it would stay there. Now, so far, this is basically just like a classical bit. It's got two states spin up and spin down, which are like the classical one and zero.\n But the funny thing about quantum objects is that they can be in both states at once. Now when you measure the spin it will be either up or down, but before you measure it the electron can exist in what's called a quantum superposition where these coefficients in\n indicate the relative probability of finding the electron in one state or the other. Now it's hard to imagine how this enables the incredible computing power of quantum computers without considering two interacting quantum bits. Hello, hi.\n there are four possible states of these two electrons you could think that well that's just like two bits of a classical computer right if you have two bits you can write 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n There's four numbers. But these are still just two bits of information, right? All I need to say to determine which one of the four numbers you have in your computer code is the value of the first bit and the value of the second bit.\n Here instead, quantum mechanics allows me to make superposition of each one of these four states. So I can write a quantum mechanical state which is perfectly\n So to determine the state of this two spin system, I need to give you four numbers, four coefficients.\n coefficients. Whereas in the classical example of the two bits, I only need to give you two bits. So this is how you understand why two qubits actually contain four bits of information. I need to give you four\n numbers to tell you the state of the system. Whereas here I only need two. If we make three spins, we would have eight different states and it would give you eight different numbers to define the state of those three spins. Whereas classically\n just three bits. If you keep going, what you'll find is that the amount of equivalent classical information contained by n qubits is 2 to the power n classical bits.\n And of course, the power of exponentials tells you that once you have, let's say, 300 of those qubits in what we call the fully entangled state, so you must be able\n to create these really crazy states where there is a superposition of all three hundreds being one way and another way and another way and so on, then you have like two to the 300 classical bits, which is as many\n particles as there are in the universe. But there's a catch. Although the qubits can exist in any combination of states, when they are measured they must fall into one of the basis states and all the other information about the state before the measurement is lost. So you do\n want generally to have as the final result of your quantum computation something that is a very complicated superposition of states because you cannot measure a superposition. You can only measure one of these basis states.\n So what you want is to design the logical operations that you need to get to the final computational result in such a way that the\n The final result is something you're able to measure. It's just a unique state. That's not trivial. That's not trivial. And it's essentially, I'm kind of stretching things here, but I guess it's to some degree the reason why\n quantum computers are not a replacement for classical computers. They're not universally faster. They're only faster for special types of calculations where you can use the\n the fact that you have all these quantum superpositions available to you at the same time to do some kind of computational parallelism. If you just want to watch a video in high definition or browse the internet or write\n some documenting word, they're not going to give you any particular improvement if you need to use a classical algorithm to get to the result. So you should not think of a quantum computer as something where every\n Every operation is faster. In fact, every operation is probably going to be slower than in the computer you have on the desk. But it's a computer where the number of operations required to arrive at the result is exponentially smaller.\n So the improvement is not in the speed of the individual operation, it's in the total number of operations you need to arrive at the result. But that is only the case in particular types of calculations, in particular algorithms. It's not universal.\n which is why it's not a replacement of a classical.\n What this will do, you see,"

With walking droplets, the pilot wave goes through both slits, interfering with itself, while the droplet only goes through one slit. The droplet doesn't move in a straight line\n though. It's deflected by its interaction with the wave. The resulting distribution of where the droplets end up looks very similar to quantum double-slit interference patterns. Or take tunneling. In quantum mechanics it's possible for a particle to get through a barrier and\n that it wouldn't classically have enough energy to get over. This has been demonstrated with walkers by creating a shallow barrier under the surface of the oil. Usually the barrier reflects the pilot wave and its bouncing droplet, but in rare cases the droplet does cross the boundary.\n And the probability of the droplet crossing the barrier decreases exponentially with the increasing width of the barrier, just as in quantum tunneling. Perhaps the most surprising thing about these walkers is they exhibit quantization, just like electrons bound to atoms.\n Here the walker is confined to a circular corral. The droplet seems to move around randomly as it interacts with its pilot wave. The complex interaction between the droplet and the wave leads to chaotic motion of the droplet. But over time a pattern builds up.\n This is the probability density of finding the droplet at any point within the corral and it looks very similar to the probability density of electrons confined in a quantum corral. All of these similarities are no coincidence. They're walking\n Droplet's actually create a remarkable physical realization of a theory proposed by de Broglie nearly a hundred years ago in the early days of quantum mechanics. He postulated that all particles have a wave that accompanies them and guides their motion and that wave is a\n actually created by tiny oscillations of the particle. Now this pilot wave theory was marginalized when the standard Copenhagen interpretation became widely adopted. The Copenhagen interpretation excludes anything that cannot be directly observed.\n And it says everything that can be known about a particle is contained in its so-called wave function. But adopting this view forces you to give up on some common sense notions like the idea that particles have a definite position and momentum even when they're not being measured.\n And it also meant that the universe was no longer deterministic. Randomness is built into standard quantum mechanics. For example, take the double slit experiment. According to quantum mechanics, the wave function of the electron is a superposition of the electron's\n electron going through one slit and the other slit simultaneously. Using this wave function you can calculate the probability of where the electron is likely to be and then when you detect it at the screen the electron pops up at one point at random\n that was in that distribution. We say that its wave function collapses instantaneously at the moment of measurement. You can't say that the electron was there before you measured it and you can't even say that the electron must have gone through one slit or the other. Compare that with\n picture provided by the bouncing droplets. In this case, the pilot wave goes through both slits, but the droplet only goes through one. The droplet is pushed around by its interaction with the wave, so that the resulting statistical distribution is the same. The droplet never exists in two places\n at once and there's no randomness. If there is any uncertainty it's just due to our ignorance of what's going on. It's not that it doesn't exist. So pilot wave dynamics can produce many of the same results as quantum mechanics. Does this\n Does this mean that this is really what quantum particles are doing? No. But I think it'll at least suggest that this is possible. These are possible dynamics that could lead to the statistics which are captured in the quantum mechanical theory.\n about this is it gives you a clear idea of what's going on. You don't have to abandon the idea that the universe is deterministic and you get particles with definite position and momenta. I think it's great that we have two competing theories for the same\n experiments and they both ask you to accept odd things just different odd things and it comes down to what you're comfortable with really whether you prefer the Copenhagen interpretation of standard quantum mechanics or a pilot wave theory.\n Let me know what you think in the comments. Do you like the pilot waves? I mean, it's definitely a very appealing picture. Whether or not it corresponds to reality, that remains to be seen.

Now I know someone else who is pursuing their science goals this week and\n it's destined over at Smarter Every Day. He and I were looking at basically the same phenomenon but he was looking at water droplets and why they don't coalesce. So if you want to see how that works and how it works in space go check it out on his channel over at Smarter Every Day and as always\n Thanks for watching. Looking at only one frame per bounce, you can see how the droplets motion is guided by the wave it's effectively surfing on. And the wave remains even if the droplet disappears, as happens sometimes if it increases\n counters a little bit of dirt. What's really cool about this is the wave actually stores information about where the droplet has been. This is because every time the droplet bounces it creates a new circular wave centered on its present location and that\n That wave adds to the existing wave field on the surface. So as the droplet moves, the waves it makes keep adding up, storing the information of where it's been. In fact, you can actually get the droplet to land on the backside of the wave. So now it's pushed backwards.\n and it retraces its steps, erasing each wave it made previously one at a time."

            "transcription": "Now that we have nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants, you might think that it was always inevitable that we would be able to harness the energy inside the nucleus of atoms. But that was far from the case. In fact, serious scientists thought the idea was laughable.\n Like Nobel laureate Robert Millikan who in 1928 said, Or as Rutherford put it,\n anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine. Now there was good reason for their pessimism. When Becquerel first observed radioactivity he thought it was a phenomenon similar to phosphorescence. That's when you shine\n radiation like light onto an object and it absorbs that energy and later re-radiates it in a different part of the spectrum. Now, uranium ore was known to do this as I witnessed firsthand. Oh yeah, heck yes, fluorescent uranium\n Here it's absorbing UV light and re-radiating it as visible light. In 1896, Becquerel performed experiments where he placed uranium ore in the sunshine on top of some\n wrapped up photographic film. He found that the film was exposed, seemingly by invisible rays from the uranium ore that penetrated the paper when the uranium was excited by the sunlight. But one day when he went to do his experiment, the weather in Paris was lousy, so he put the uranium\n and the photographic film inside a drawer. And a few days later, even though the uranium hadn't seen the sun, he decided to develop the film anyway. And what he found was that the photographic film had been exposed just as before. Even though the uranium was\n was not excited by sunlight. So this was not a phosphorescence phenomenon. Some type of radiation and therefore energy was coming out of a rock, unprovoked. But how could a seemingly inert object like a rock give off energy?\n Where is it getting that energy from? It was a mystery that seemed to violate the law of conservation of energy. That is until Einstein published his famous E equals MC squared, which suggested a source of energy for the radiation might be the mass of\n of the nucleus. Just a tiny bit of mass can give you a lot of energy. And this premise was enough for science fiction writers to let their imaginations run wild. Like H.G. Wells, who in 1914 published the book The World Set Free, which\n This includes the first mention of the words atomic bomb. He envisioned a uranium based hand grenade that would continue to explode indefinitely. But to scientists, this was completely detached from reality. As Einstein in 1933 put it,\n is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will. And that's just the thing. People had no ability to make a nucleus do anything. All we were observing was the natural process of\n radioactive decay, atoms of a particular unstable isotope decaying at random with some characteristic half-life. And the energy given off, although immense on the scale of an atom, is pretty insignificant on the scale of people and the world.\n Now up until 1932, the only known particle in the nucleus was the proton. So if you wanted to alter a nucleus, you could\n conceivably fire a proton at it. But since the nucleus and the proton are both positively charged, they repel. So you'd have to fire the proton in with such high speed and accuracy to get it to hit and stick to a target. And even then if you're successful you've only affected\n one nucleus, which at best can't even lift a grain of sand. So you can see why the Nobel Prize winners were saying nuclear weapons? Not gonna happen. But then comes the discovery of the neutron, and the neutron changes everything, because as an uncharted\n nuclear particle it can drift ghostly, undeflected through matter until it hits a nucleus, transforming it into something else. And this leads to the epiphany of a man named Leo Szilard. Now Szilard read the world set free so he's already imagined\n He says\n emit two neutrons when it absorbed one neutron, then such an element, if assembled in sufficiently large mass, could sustain a nuclear chain reaction. In other words, the neutron enables us to trigger nuclear reactions at will, and if there's a nucleus which\n when it splits in this way, releases two neutrons, it could trigger more and more fissions at an exponentially increasing rate. The nucleus that has this property is uranium-235. In fact, on average it releases two and a half neutrons every time it divides.\n Now all of a sudden you have the possibility of splitting zillions of nuclei simultaneously, releasing incredible amounts of energy all at once. That's an atomic bomb. Now if you want more control over this release of energy, as in a nuclear power plant,\n plant well then you have to absorb a few neutrons so that the fission of one nucleus only causes the fission of one other nucleus on average then you have a steady chain reaction that emits the same amount of energy each instant the challenge is that this is like balancing on an\n So if not for the existence of the neutron, a neutral nuclear\n particle to trigger reactions that occurs in greater numbers relative to protons in the larger nuclei, meaning they're likely to be given off when a large nucleus splits, well then maybe, as many brilliant scientists suspected, it would be impossible to harness the energy in the nucleus.\n But as it is in our universe, the neutron is the hero or the villain of nuclear physics.

            "transcription": "There are a lot of misconceptions out there, and this is a video about one of the most common ones. So I went around asking people what makes the moon go around the earth, and they told me...\n The Earth puts a gravitational force on the Moon. But does the Moon put a gravitational pull on the Earth? Pull on the Earth? Yes it does. Hence we have tides, etc. The Moon pulls on the Earth too, at a fixed rate.\n like the tides and women and... That is very powerful this thing. Does the moon pull on the earth? Probably that as well, yeah. So what I want to know is how does that force that the moon exerts\n exerts on the Earth. How does that compare in terms of size to the force the Earth exerts on the Moon? Well, no scientists, but I think that one would be more powerful than that one. It's got a greater force coming from the Earth, because it's a greater mass. Because the Earth probably has more mass.\n it's a bigger mass and I thought greater mass is more equals more force. Does the moon pull on the earth? Yes, but a lot less. Yeah, not as much as the earth pulls on the moon. Yeah, but a little bit. Not very strongly. Yes, but my\n much much much smaller because of its mass, its size because it's smaller it's much smaller than the earth because it's smaller is it small? allow me to let you in on a little secret everyone got it\n wrong. The force that attracts the moon to the earth is exactly the same size as the force that attracts the earth to the moon. So what's going on here? Why did everyone get it wrong? Well I think it comes down to cause and effect.\n The effect of the force on the moon is quite clear. The moon goes in circles around the earth. But the effect of that force on the earth is basically negligible. The earth barely wobbles at all.\n interpret this negligible effect as indicating there's very little force affecting the earth. But that is forgetting the third key piece of the puzzle, which is inertia. Inertia is the tendency of mass to\n maintain its state of motion. Since the earth has a greater mass, it has a greater inertia and so even with the same amount of force on it, it doesn't accelerate that much. Now the funny thing is many of the\n people I interviewed could state Newton's third law, which is...\n Which Newton's law are we talking about? The whole equal and opposite force thing. Yeah, that one. So tell me what you're thinking now. Well, one would think that if the Earth is putting a force on me, I would be putting an equal force upon it. So why didn't they apply it to this problem?\n Well, I think they may have memorized the words, but not really believe Newton's third law in their core. Did they really feel it in their spleen? I don't think they did. So, allow me to try\n convince you, all of you, spleen included, that Newton's third law really is true. Let's consider two objects. Initially they have the same mass, one kilogram each. So obviously the gravitation\n force of attraction must be the same on both of the objects. Now let's add a second kilogram to the first object. The force on the second object will now be twice as great because that one kilogram\n is attracted equally to each of the kilograms in the first object. But what is often forgotten is that new kilogram is also attracted to the second object, meaning that the total force on each object is still the same.\n same. They're attracted to each other with an equal and opposite force. We could add a third kilogram and we would find the same thing. The force on both objects is still the same even though the object on the left has three times the mass of the\n object on the right. So we can see that no matter what the mass, any two objects will have the same gravitational force towards each other. Can you feel Newton's third law in your spleen now? It should\n settle inside you and become a part of you."

And the cost of damages was in excess of $20 billion.\n It's earthquakes like this one that make us question just how solid is the earth beneath our feet? And what does it mean to be solid anyway? At first glance, pitch looks like a solid, but it's not.\n actually a liquid at room temperature, just a very viscous one. Viscosity is a measure of resistance to flow, what we often think of as the thickness of a liquid. Olive oil is nearly a hundred times more viscous than water.\n water, and honey is about 100 times more viscous than that. Meanwhile, pitch has a viscosity 230 billion times that of water. At the University of Queensland in Australia, pitch is the subject of the world's longest-running\n lab experiment and it's still going to this day. Back in 1927 this glob of pitch was placed into a funnel and ever since then in nearly 90 years it has produced only nine drips rather\n roughly one decade, and no one has ever been in the room to see a drop fall. Though, in 1988, the former custodian of the experiment, John Mainstone, came very close to observing a drip fall.\n Except he stepped out of the room for just a few minutes to get a cup of tea Now you can actually watch this experiment live there's a link in the description But since the last drop happened in 2014, I think you'll be\n probably be waiting a while. Another substance you may have heard is a very viscous liquid is glass. If you look at the stained glass windows of old churches you will find the bottom of a pane is decidedly thicker than the top and that's because the glass has been flowing\n down over centuries. Actually, no, it hasn't. You know, we've looked at old telescopes where the optics is very sensitive to slight shifts in the lens glass. We find they still work perfectly after hundreds of years.\n Plus studies of thousand-year-old windows find no real evidence of flow. The truth is it is just very difficult to make glass of uniform thickness and so when the glass was originally installed thousands of years ago\n they would install the thickest part towards the bottom. The lead actually has a lower viscosity than the glass, so if the glass had even thickened a little bit, then the lead should be a puddle on the floor by now. Now glass is unusual in that it's an\n amorphous solid, meaning that the silica molecules are not regularly arranged as in a regular crystalline lattice. Instead they're all in a jumble, and this is because the glass is cooled down so quickly from the liquid state to the solid state\n that the molecules don't have time to arrange themselves in a nice regular crystal structure. But what makes something a solid rather than a liquid is that all of the atoms or molecules are so strongly bonded together chemically that they can't slide past each other.\n So in water or olive oil or pitch, the molecules can slide past each other, but in glass at room temperature, they can't. So what about the interior of the Earth? Beneath the Earth's crust is the mantle, which is responsible for the air.\n responsible for plate tectonics and therefore earthquakes. Is it a solid or a liquid? We can obviously never observe the mantle directly, but when we do see material come out from underground, it is red-hot rock.\n It is lava. So you might be imagining that the mantle is very similar made up of this molten magma Hot liquid rock and that would make sense because in order for it to flow it must be a liquid right? actually wrong\n The mantle is a solid under all that pressure even though it's at very high temperature it remains in the solid state and we know the mantle is solid because sheer waves from earthquakes can actually propagate through the mantle these waves can not\n propagate through liquid like the molten iron of Earth's outer core because liquids flow in response to being sheared or rubbed sideways. And as a result we can see the shadow of the liquid outer core by measuring seismic waves from an Earth's\n But how exactly does this solid rock flow? Well the answer lies in the fact that crystals aren't perfect. There may be a missing atom here or there, and under the high pressures in the mantle, sometimes a neighboring atom\n and will pop in to fill that gap. Now from a human perspective, it takes a very long time for this to have a noticeable effect. But from the Earth's perspective, it happens in no time at all. The viscosity of the mantle is similar to that of glass,\n to several orders of magnitude greater. So it is really only over these geological time scales that the mantle is fluid-like at all. So pitch, a liquid, can flow so slowly as to seem like a solid.\n Whereas the Earth's mantle, a solid, behaves like a fluid if you just wait long enough. As the famous American geologist Grove Carl Gilbert once said,\n Solidity and plasticity are not absolute terms, but relative, and all solids are in fact both rigid and plastic. When great masses and great forces are involved, the distinction loses value. Sometimes the rigid definitions we create for\n for ourselves can introduce misconceptions or viscous rumors. Like the idea that the core of the earth is a giant ball of magma. If only we could think about liquids and solids a little bit more fluidly.\n Hey, this episode of Veritasium was supported by audible.com, a leading provider of audiobooks with over 180,000 titles in all areas of literature.\n including fiction, nonfiction, and periodicals.

If you look closely at a shadow, as you move the object away from the wall, you'll notice that the shadow gets a bit fuzzy.\n so clearly the edges are lighter. Now we know that light bends around corners, that's a phenomenon called diffraction. So is it diffraction that's responsible for the fuzzy edges of shadows? Actually, no. The reason\n The reason that shadows have fuzzy edges is because most light sources like the sun are not perfectly point objects. So light from one edge of the sun is coming in at a very slightly different angle from light from the other edge of the sun and that's what gives us these fuzzy edges. It's not diffraction.\n But diffraction can play a significant role in shadows, and in fact it was the cause of a massive debate about 200 years ago. In 1818, the French Academy sponsored a competition to try to find the best explanation of diffraction.\n And Augustine Fresnel entered this competition with the suggestion that light is a wave phenomenon and just like any ordinary wave it bends as it passes around an obstacle. But one of the judges was Simeon Poisson, a harsh critic of the wave theory. He much preferred\n Newton's idea that light was a stream of particles and to show just how ridiculous the wave theory was he showed that Fresnel's theory would predict a bright spot in the shadow right in the middle of the shadow behind a circular object that there would be a spot\n almost as bright as if the object wasn't there at all and he thought this was absurd but my question is does it exist is the brightest part of a shadow really in the middle? To find out we're gonna have to do the experiment.\n So first I had to find some circular obstacles. I selected spheres instead. I got some marbles and some small spherical magnets. Then for a powerful light source and a large distance to the screen, I selected a lecture theater with a projector.\n is a small aperture for the light to pass through. So I'm going to poke a hole in this card with a screw. It's important to have a small aperture because you want the light to be in phase and that should work\n If it's all coming out of this small little aperture, but when I put a sphere in front of it all right I'm gonna hit the lights Here we go I can't see a bright spot. I can't really see anything\n So next, I tried a cellphone flashlight, putting a marble in front of that, and again, I could see nothing. I don't see anything in the middle. The idea with Poisson's spot is\n that light should diffract around a circular object or a sphere and because the center of the shadow is equidistant from all the edges of that obstacle, all of the light should constructively interfere at that point creating that bright spot.\n So next I tried an overhead projector. I tried a string of the small spherical magnets. It's weird, like I feel like I can see it. Do you think you can see a bright spot in the middle of the bottom one? No. No? I feel like in the very center of each one I can see a\n bright spot. I don't know my eyes are just totally going nuts up here like staring at shadows and trying to see what we want. But this one is opaque it's nice and spherical set it down\n And if I adjust the focus, you can see there is a bright spot right in the middle of that marble. So the spot looks pretty good.\n Something about it didn't sit right with me. And you know, when you think something is true, you really should try as hard as you can to disprove it. What if you used your fingers to kind of make the edges less spherical?\n Yeah. See, that I think is concerning, the fact that we can still see a bit of spot even though it looks like you're... Right? How is that?\n light getting through and getting there. What was really happening was light was coming up from the base of this overhead projector, bouncing off this lens back onto the top of the marble and then back up through this lens and onto the\n So finally I decided to use a laser. I resisted doing this earlier because in 1818 they didn't have lasers. In fact, Poisson didn't do the experiment. He didn't think that you needed to. The idea of a bright spot in the middle of a shadow\n was just so ridiculous and Fresnel didn't do the experiment either but one of the other judges by the name of Aragog decided to actually do the experiment and when he did it he saw something similar to what I saw\n So here I was using the laser through a diverging lens and then that beam was shone onto a marble resting on top of a loop of tape. So you can see on the wall basically exactly what you'd expect, just a shadow of the marble.\n But when you turn the lights off, there it is. A bright spot right in the middle of that shadow. So the brightest part of a shadow is in the middle, as long as it's the shadow of a circular or spherical object.\n Now this spot is sometimes called Arrigo's spot because he did the experiment and found it. Sometimes it's called Fresnel's bright spot because it was his theory. But pretty frequently it's referred to as Poisson's spot. A harsh reminder that it's not\n only your great achievements, but also your greatest mistakes that can be named after you. We don't see Poisson's spot in our day-to-day lives for many reasons, one of which is that most objects are not perfect circles. Plus, if they\n have any surface roughness really at all that will completely wash out Poisson's spot. And finally most light sources are not coherent that is the waves are not coming all in phase peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs. So you might\n You might think you could never see Poisson's spot under ordinary conditions, but you can. What you need to do is look at a diffuse source of bright light, like a fluorescent tube or the blue sky. You should see some\n small light specks drifting around your visual field. Now those are caused by floaters, little particles actually drifting around inside your eyeball. They can be all sorts of different shapes but some of them are spheres.\n And so they cast a shadow on the back of your retina and right in the middle of that shadow is Poisson's bright spot and That is what demonstrated that light really is a wave phenomenon, and you don't even have to take my word for it\n for it. You can see it with your very own eyes.\n you"

            "transcription": "To find the prime factors of a 2048 bit number, it would take a classical computer millions of years. A quantum computer could do it in just minutes. And that is because a quantum computer is built on qubits, these devices which take advantage of quantum superposition to reduce the number of steps required to complete the computation. But how do you actually make a qubit in practice? And how do you read and write information on it? I met up with researchers who are using the Outermost\n using the outermost electron in a phosphorus atom as a qubit. This single phosphorus atom is embedded in a silicon crystal right next to a tiny transistor. Now the electron has a magnetic dipole called its spin and it has two orientations up or down which are like the classical one and zero. Now to differentiate the energy state of the electron when it's in spin up and spin down you need to apply a strong magnetic field. And to do that we use a superconducting magnet. So superconducting\n So a superconducting magnet is a large solenoid, is a coil of superconducting wire that sits inside of that vessel that is full of liquid helium. So now the electron will line up with its spin pointing down, that's its lowest energy state, and it would take some energy to put it into the spin up state. But actually not that much energy, and if it were at room temperature the electron would have so much thermal energy that it would be bouncing around from spin up to spin down and back. And so you need to cool down the whole\n down the whole apparatus to only a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero. That way you know that the electron will definitely be spin down. There is not enough thermal energy in the surroundings to flip it the other way. Now if you want to write information onto the qubit, you can put the electron into the spin up state by hitting it with a pulse of microwaves. But that pulse needs to be a very specific frequency. And that frequency depends on the magnetic field that the electron is sitting in.\n is sitting in. So what you see here is the frequency that is being produced by this microwave source and it's 45.021 GHz, which in the magnetic field that we are applying now is the resonance frequency of the electron. So the electron is a little bit like a radio that can only tune into one station and when that station is broadcasting the electron gets all excited and turns to the spin up state. But you can stop at any point. So if you just make it mutate and stop your pulse at some\n your pulse at some specific point, what you've created is a special quantum superposition of the spin up and spin down states with a specific phase between the two superpositions. And how do you read out the information? Will you use the transistor that this phosphorus atom is embedded next to? The spin down has the lower energy and the spin up has the higher energy. Now, in this transistor, there is in fact a little puddle of electrons. This puddle of electrons\n This puddle of electrons is filled up up to a certain energy. So this vertical axis here is energy and here we have all these electrons that line up in energy just like the electrons on the shells of an atom. So now if the electron is pointing up it can jump into the transistor, right? Because it has more energy than all the others. It leaves behind the bare nuclear charge of the phosphorus, right? The phosphorus has one more positive charge in the nucleus as compared to\n nucleus as compared to silicon, but normally it's neutralized by the extra electrons so the two things cancel out. But if you take the electron away, then the phosphorus has a positive charge. So it says if you have a positive voltage, a more positive voltage applied to this gate. It doesn't come from the gate, it comes from the atom, but it's the same. It's just a positive voltage. It's like the transistor has been switched more on. And so you see a pulse of current and that indicates that the electron was in the spin up state. In this measurement phase,\n This measurement phase, if you find one of these spikes of current, it's because you had an electron spin up. So you can play catching a spin up or a spin down electron. You see there was no current here, that was a spin down electron. Try again. Again a spin down electron. Spin up electron. Now these researchers have actually gone further using the nucleus of the phosphorus atom as a qubit. Like an electron, the nucleus has a spin, although it's 2,000 times weaker than the spin of the electron.\n spin of the electron. But you can still write to it the same way using electromagnetic radiation. Only it needs to be a longer wavelength and a longer pulse in order to get the spin to flip. Because it's so small, so weakly magnetic and so perfectly isolated from the rest of the world, it's a qubit that lives for a very long time. But how do you read out the spin of the nucleus? Well, you use the electron. Remember that the electron's frequency\n The electron's frequency that it will respond to depends on the magnetic field that it's sitting in. So that magnetic field is the external magnetic field that is produced by the superconducting magnet, but there is also an internal magnetic field coming from the nucleus. But that internal magnetic field can have two directions, right? The nucleus can be pointing up or down itself. So what it means is that there are two frequencies at which the electron can respond depending on the direction of the nucleus.\n So the nucleus actually acts as a little selector. It tells the electron basically which radio station it can listen to. So what you're looking at now is an experiment where we actually flip the nucleus every five seconds. So for five seconds you will see that the electron always responds because the nucleus is always in the right direction to make the electron respond to the frequency we were applying to the electron. And then for the other five seconds\n In this period of time, the nucleus has been flipped down. And now after five seconds it will flip up and the electron starts responding.\n Now because all of this depends so sensitively on magnetic fields, you need to make sure to eliminate all spin from the silicon crystal. But unfortunately, natural silicon contains about 5% the isotope silicon-29, and that does have a spin. But in fact, the beauty of silicon is that it has this isotope, silicon-28, that has no nuclear spin. The nuclear spin is zero. So it's a completely non-magnetic atom. But where are you going to find a pure crystal of silicon-28?\n Oh, wait. So the offcuts from that silicon sphere are actually being used as the home for qubits. That, I think, is incredible.

He took the temperature water freezes at and said that's zero and then he took the temperature it boils at and says that's a hundred and He figured a hundred was a good amount of demarcations to make in between the two. Right? Yeah. Except that's not what he did. Really? Celsius never devised nor used the scale that now bears his name. Are you kidding me? No, Michael. I'm not. This is the Swedish town of Uppsala.\n Swedish town of Uppsala, located 70 kilometers north of Stockholm. So this is the house where Celsius lived. In 1741, he was professor of astronomy at Uppsala University. And this is the first ever Celsius thermometer. Or is it?\n Scale on the left hand side. Yeah, and Celsius is new scale on the right. Yeah These few markings show that Celsius came up with the idea of separating the freezing and boiling points of water by 100 degrees He made his first observations with the scale on Christmas Day 1741 But have you noticed something strange about this scale? I mean 50 is marked in the middle, but the numbers increased down towards the bulb of the thermometer So Celsius had his scale upside down. He said\n he set zero degrees at the boiling point of water and a hundred at the freezing point. Why would he do this? Well, for one thing, Celsius was just following the convention of the other scale on the thermometer. The Lille scale also had zero degrees for the boiling point of water, increasing down to 150 for his freezing point. And the likely reason both of them used upside down scales is because they avoid negative numbers. In Sweden, it gets much colder than freezing, but never warmer than boiling water. So you don't have to worry about\n you don't have to worry about pesky minus signs, and this helps avoid logbook errors. I think it would be really weird if you had water boiling at zero degrees and freezing at a hundred. Wouldn't that be strange? Although it might seem strange today, there is no objectively good reason for preferring an ascending scale over a descending one for measuring degrees of something, like hot or cold. In fact, when Celsius died of tuberculosis in 1744, he was still using this inverted scale.\n scale. So who reversed it? Who do we have to thank for the modern Celsius temperature scale? Well in 1745, just a year after Celsius's death, a new column appears in the Uppsala temperature record using the modern scale and at the top it's got the heading Ekstrom. Now Ekstrom was the instrument maker at Uppsala. In 1747 another column is added with the heading Stromer who was Celsius's successor as professor of astronomy. Again it's got the same modern scale. But it's another\n But it's another professor at Uppsala who claims that he reversed the scale. That's the famous biologist Carl Linnaeus. He says he reversed the scale when he ordered a thermometer from Ekstrom for his greenhouse. Whoever it was, we know that by 1745 there was an operational thermometer at Uppsala University with a scale that we now all know as the Celsius temperature scale. Except, this was not the first such thermometer ever created. In 1743, the year before Celsius died,\n Celsius died, a French scientist working independently in Lyon created a thermometer with zero degrees at the freezing point of water and a hundred at the boiling point. His name was Jean-Pierre Christin. So why isn't it called a degree Christin instead of a degree Celsius? Well for a long time this temperature scale wasn't referred to using either of their names and instead it was just called the centigrade scale meaning a hundred steps. The problem with this was centigrade has other meanings in French\n meanings in French, Spanish, and Italian, where a grade specifically refers to 1 one hundredth of a right angle. So to eliminate this confusion, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in 1948 decided to rename the centigrade scale after a scientist, bringing it into alignment with other temperature scales like Kelvin and Fahrenheit. They chose Celsius possibly due to a popular 1800s German chemistry textbook by a guy named Braselius. In it, Braselius identified Celsius as the first to devise a temperature scale\n a temperature scale with zero at water's freezing point and a hundred at its boiling point, propagating the myth that Celsius created this scale. So is Celsius undeserving of having his name immortalized on weather maps around the world? Well, no. I mean, making two marks and deciding on a number of degrees in between them, that is the easy part, which others could, and as history shows, did do. But what Celsius did was he established which physical processes could reliably produce a fixed temperature. At the time when he was working,\n At the time when he was working, there were some 30 different temperature scales in use. Some thermometers had 18 different scales on them. Some more reliable than others. For fixed reference points, one scale used the deepest cellar of the Paris Observatory. Others used the melting temperature of butter, the internal temperatures of certain animals, or the hottest day in summer in Italy, Syria, or Senegal. These dubious scales, combined with inconsistent thermometer construction, made recording accurate temperatures near\n temperatures nearly impossible, not to mention sharing those temperatures with other scientists elsewhere.\n Celsius's name is a unit of temperature even though the scale itself was not created by him and in fact today the Celsius scale is no longer defined by either of water's phase transition points instead it is based off the Kelvin scale and that scale is defined by setting the triple point of water where solid liquid and gas all exist in equilibrium at exactly 273.16 Kelvin this fixes the size of a degree Kelvin which is exactly the same as the size of a degree Celsius\n Celsius the zero point of the Celsius scale is set at 273.15 Kelvin now what all this means is that today pure water boils at 99.974 degrees Celsius and freezes at negative 0.0001 Celsius this precision in a nearly universal system of temperature measurement is thanks to a huge number of scientists so the C after the degree symbol stands not only for Celsius or Kristen or Carl Linnaeus\n Carl Linnaeus, but for the community of scientists whose work over centuries made a scale so robust that we take it for granted.\n accepted any pledges on that page.

            "transcription": "What will happen tomorrow is not random. In other words, it's at least somewhat predictable. I mean, not entirely to be sure, but some things will happen for certain and other things definitely won't. For example, the sun will rise\n water will still freeze at 0 degrees celsius and you won't become Michael Stevens. We know this because everything in the universe is made of 12 fundamental particles and they interact in four predictable ways. What if I were able to determine the positions and\n velocities of every single one of these particles in the universe. Well, you would be the intelligence envisioned by Laplace who thought if you could really figure out where everything is and how fast it's moving, you would know the entire future of the universe because you know how every particle interacts with every other particle.\n Wow, so nothing would be unpredictable, which means nothing would be random. Not even human behavior. Since we are made of the same fundamental particles as everything in the rest of the universe, everything we will ever do or have ever done\n would be determined by the information in the state of the universe at any one time. But what is information? Well, it seems to be fundamentally about order. The order of molecules in your DNA contain the information\n needed to make you.\n information seems to be about order, regularity. That is, until you really think about it. I mean, does every letter of a word carry the same amount of information? No. I mean, after a\n you know almost for certain that the next letter will be a U. After a TH, there will probably be an E. So these letters carry very little information because you could predict them beforehand. They are redundant. In fact, the founder of information theory\n Claude Shannon estimated the redundancy of English at about 75%, which is why we can make sense of things like this. So English can be compressed because it is not random. It has patterns.\n Similarly, video is compressible because of its regularities. In each frame, the pixels of similar color cluster together. Plus, from frame to frame, most of the pixels don't change, so you only need to record the ones that do change.\n advantage of this technique to create some trippy effects known as data moshing. It's the application of the movement data from one video to the pixels of another. It also means that an average video can be compressed to just one thousandth of its original\n original size. But what is the most you can compress something? Well, anything that is not random, any patterns or regularities can be reduced because they are predictable. So you can continue shrinking a file down until what you're left with\n is totally random and that will contain all of the information of the original item but distilled, pure information. So pure information is randomness.\n If you want to know how much information something contains, you need to know how random it is. And randomness is disorder. What we also call... Entropy. So information fundamentally.\n is entropy. This makes sense if you consider a string of binary digits. For example, this string is perfectly ordered. It has very low entropy and it contains no information. That's the state of an erased hard drive. Now this string contains\n slightly more information but again the regularities allow it to be easily compressed. So the string that contains the maximum amount of information is just a random set of zeros and ones. It has maximum entropy\n because it's totally disordered. You could not predict any of those digits by looking at any of the other digits. And if you wanted to send this information to someone, you would have no other option but to send the whole string of digits. There's no way to compress it.\n But here's the thing about any object that contains maximum information. For us as human beings, they carry no meaning. For example, a video containing maximum information would look like this. It is just white noise.\n The color of each pixel is independent of all the other pixels and they all change randomly. This video could not be compressed because it's already totally random. Now a random sequence of DNA would not make an organism and a random string of letters does not generate\n We are drawn to things that are neither perfectly ordered, containing no information, nor are they perfectly disordered, containing maximum information. Somewhere in the middle, we can recognize complex patterns of information.\n patterns, and that is where we derive meaning, in music, poetry, and ideas. It is this search for meaning that leads us to propose scientific theories, which if you think about it, are really our way of compressing\n compressing the universe. For example, general relativity, our current theory of gravity, compresses into one short equation everything from how an apple falls to the earth, to how the moon orbits the earth, how all the planets orbit the sun, how the sun orbits a supermassive black hole at the\n center of our galaxy, how black holes form and behave, and how the whole universe expands out from the Big Bang. Now that we have this theory, the future is more predictable. I mean, we can predict eclipses thousands of years into the future.\n So with all of our scientific theories, does that mean that the universe is completely not random? That it is perfectly predictable? Well, let's assume for a second that Laplace was right, and that knowing the state of the universe at any one time\n means you also know its state at every other time as well. Well that would mean that the information in our universe would be constant. But if information is entropy, that would mean the entropy of the universe is\n also constant and that does not appear to be the universe that we live in. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in the universe increases with time or in other words things don't stir themselves apart but if entropy is going\n That means the information in our universe is constantly increasing. That makes sense, because it would take more information to specify the state of the universe now than right after the Big Bang. So where is this new information coming from?\n My best bet is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics describes how the 12 fundamental particles behave and as spectacularly successful as it is, it is only a probabilistic theory, meaning that you cannot predict with absolute certainty\n So when you do interact with it and locate the electron at a particular point, you have gained information.\n something that you couldn't have predicted with certainty beforehand. This drove Einstein crazy. He said God does not play dice, referring to this. I mean he wished that we could compress our theory of quantum mechanics further so that we could really figure out\n where these particles were going to be. But maybe the reason why we haven't been able to compress quantum mechanics further is because fundamentally it's random. Fundamentally new information is being generated every time a quantum\n quantum event like that occurs. In that case, it could be these quantum measurements which are driving up the entropy of the universe. They are creating new information all of the time and that means the disorder in our universe\n must go up. This is what we observe as the second law of thermodynamics. You know we often think about the second law as a curse, as though everything which is ordered is going towards disorder. But maybe, I mean it's\n It's only in a universe where this law is obeyed that the truly unexpected can occur. That the future can be actually undetermined.

            "transcription": "A few months ago I made a video about Schlieren imaging. Now that's a technique used to visualize tiny differences in air, either temperature, pressure, composition, so you can see things like the heat that comes off when you light a match.\n Now in that video I asked you for some ideas for what you'd like to see in this Schlieren setup and I will be showing you some of those in this video. But I also saw that there was a lot of confusion about how exactly the setup works and so I want to clear up that confusion.\n before we get going. So one thing is this mirror I said is a parabolic mirror but then I said you can think of it as a part of a sphere and so people rightly called me out and said well if it's parabolic it can't be part of a sphere.\n While that is true, it's such a small part of a sphere or parabola that the two shapes are pretty similar on this scale. So you could say it approximates a sphere and you would\n not be as far off as say in physics when we say this cow approximates a sphere. Now a parabolic concave mirror is a pretty good approximation for a spherical concave mirror. Now the second major question is how do you get enough light to make this work? I mean some\n Some of those shots I was showing you were shot at 2000 frames per second and using only one tiny LED as the light source. How could that even work? Well, I had similar kind of concerns when I was going to set this up and so I sought out the most powerful\n flashlights that I could find, I figured this would be my light source. So that light bounces off the mirror. Now the focal length of my mirror is 1.8 meters, which means that the light converges at the center of curvature, which is two times the focal length,\n 3.6 meters back and you can see that here the reflected light that comes off the mirror is converging on this card that I'm holding up. You can see as we get closer and closer right there look at how sharply we have an image of the\n flashlight it passes and forms a spot back here. This is essentially an image of the mirror and look how bright it is we have daylight outside okay that's very bright but you can still see\n see\n effect. You might notice this is not a fantastic Schlieren image and that's because of course this is not a point source of light. So my first thought was cover it with tinfoil and make a hole in the front to reduce the size of the\n light source. Now that has decreased the brightness of this image but it's still pretty bright and you can actually see a really nice Schlieren effect that's taking place already right here. So if you imagine\n Imagine sending all of that light down the lens of a camera. It's actually a pretty bright image, not a dim one. But if this works and produces the Schlieren effect we're looking for, then why do you need the razor blade? Well, here's the thing. The differences in refractive index that we're talking about\n are very very tiny so the way the light is deflected is just by the tiniest of degrees so that light actually will end up right here in this focal point with all the rest of the light because all of the light from the mirror is getting sent back\n to this spot, but some of it, the light that's been deflected will be just ever so slightly off and if you use this razor blade to knock off about half of that bright spot, you will be cutting off more of that light which has been deflected.\n and by cutting it off you will increase the contrast in the image. Now as some of you pointed out an alternative to using the razor blade to cut the light is using colored filters. So here I got two different colors of cellophane and if I\n position that so that the focal point is right in the middle of the divide then some of the light will pass through this magenta side and some will go through the cyan side. Have a look at what happens when I put this transparent helium\n balloon in front of the mirror. Now the helium just deflects the light a tiny amount but it's enough so that instead of going through the magenta side it goes through the cyan side and that's why the balloon looks a different color. But what happens if I pop it?\n Do you see that? After the balloon pops, the helium kind of stays together and rises in the shape of a balloon. Another thing\n you suggested was lighting a barbecue lighter with a match. So I'm just going to release some gas and I'm going to let the flame travel up the gas.\n In the Schlieren you can see the flame traveling out and through that gas up to light the lighter. Yeah! Gonna try blowing a bubble with the Rainbow Schlieren.\n Another\n Another crazy idea of yours was to light a ping pong ball on fire because ping pong balls, the good ones anyway that they use in actual tournaments, are quite flammable. So I'm going to see how that looks. Whoa, it's caught fire.\n Look at it go. Oh, that is awesome.\n Now, a lot of you recognize the sound of a plane.\n recommendations involve sound for example trying to see a clap I Tried this again and again and I tried looking for a shockwave But it was pretty hard to see even at 2,000 frames per second and that's because with the speed of sound\n being over 300 meters per second, even at that speed you would only catch maybe one or two frames that would include the shockwave in them and I found it almost impossible to see. So looking at all these claps you can see the air getting\n getting pushed out from between my fingers, but that's not traveling at the speed of sound, so it's not the actual sound of the clap. So I'm going to have to call in some backup if we're going to do some schlieren with sound. So thank you for all of your suggestions. If you have any others,\n please leave them in the comments below. Though it may take me a little while to get back to you because next week I'm flying to Australia.

            "transcription": "Most processes in our universe are time-reversible. In other words, the physics works the same way forwards or backwards, which is why you can't tell if I'm playing these videos normally or in reverse. People typically point to entropy as the only exception to the\n The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system, or the amount of disorder, always increases with time. But increasing entropy is an emergent property, the result of the motions of many, many particles.\n Which raises the question, can fundamental particles themselves tell the direction of time? Or in other words, is there a physical process on the scale of individual particles that looks different forwards versus backwards? The answer, surprisingly,\n is yes. In particle physics there are three major symmetries that were always expected to hold. Charge, parity, and time. Time symmetry, as we've already discussed, means interactions work the same way forwards or backwards in time.\n Charge symmetry means interactions are unaffected if all the charges are swapped. In other words, there is nothing special about what we call positive charge. Nature treats it exactly equal and opposite to negative charge. And parity symmetry means the laws of physics\n are indifferent to left or right handedness. Now to understand what that means, imagine a giant mirror were held up to our universe. And in the mirror, the z direction is reversed and my right hand becomes my left hand.\n But the laws of physics shouldn't care. I mean, they should work exactly the same way in the mirror world as they do in the regular one, with no preference for left or right handedness. Or to put it another way, there should be no experiment that you could do that would tell you whether or not\n you are in the mirror world. Each of these symmetries is known by its initials, C, P, and T. In the 1950s, it was thought that all fundamental particles obey these symmetries. But then in 1956, a paper written by Li and Yang pointed\n out that parity symmetry had actually never been tested in experiments involving the weak force. So at Christmas break that year, physics professor Xianxiang Wu of Columbia University had planned to go on vacation with her husband, who was also a physicist, but instead, so\n Intrigued by the possibility that the weak force might violate parity, she decided to stay behind and be the first person to test it. To do this, she and a team of low temperature scientists cooled a collection of cobalt-60 atoms to just three thousandth of a\n degree above absolute zero. Then they applied a strong magnetic field to align all the nuclei with their spin pointing in the same direction. Now cobalt-60 is radioactive and it decays via the weak nuclear force releasing a beta particle, which is just an electron.\n And what the experiment measured was the direction in which these electrons were emitted relative to the spin of the cobalt-60 nuclei. To see how this would work under parity symmetry, let's consider the mirror image version of this experiment. In the mirror, the direction of\n of the z-axis is flipped, but the direction of nuclear spin is not. That's because an object that's rotating clockwise is still rotating clockwise in the mirror. So, this means that the spins of the regular and mirror nuclei are aligned. The mirror\n experiment is actually the same experiment as the original. Now when a cobalt-60 nucleus decays and emits an electron, that electron could go say to the left or to the right. Now if parity symmetry is respected, the electron should be equally likely to go in any direction.\n That way both the normal and mirror image experiments would give the same results. However, if the electrons were emitted in one direction preferentially, say in the positive z direction, well then in the mirror experiment the electrons would also have to fly off preferentially in the mirror positive\n z direction, which is opposite to the original positive z direction. So in the normal experiment, the electrons would be emitted say opposite the direction of nuclear spin, but in the mirror version, they'd be emitted in the same direction as nuclear spin. So how does this make any sense? It would allow\n you to determine whether you're in the mirror world or not. It's like the spinning top from Inception. If the electrons from the cobalt-60 nuclei go one way, you're in mirror world, and if they go the other way, you know you're in normal world. Now crazy as this may seem, this\n This is exactly what Professor Wu saw. Electrons were emitted preferentially in one direction, and not just by a little bit. They were predominantly emitted opposite nuclear spin. So not only does the weak force violate parity, it comes close to violating\n as much as is physically possible. This destroyed a basic assumption of theoretical physics that had been around for decades. Somehow the universe cares about left or right handedness. When Wu announced her results, they shocked\n the physics world. After being told of the experiment, famous physicist and Nobel laureate Wolfgang Pauli said, that's total nonsense and insisted the result was mistaken. When the experiment was independently replicated, theoretical physicists had to\n accept that the universe we live in is not the one they had imagined. The Nobel Prize was actually awarded for the discovery of parity violation in 1957, the very same year these results were published. This required a profound shift in thinking for\n physicists, but before throwing everything out and starting again from scratch, they formulated a workaround. Maybe it was okay that the weak force broke parity, because it's not a real symmetry of the universe itself, just part of a larger symmetry,\n The idea was if the mirror flipped not only these axes, but it also swapped the particles for antiparticles with their charges reversed, well then the symmetry would be restored and the mathematics behind our laws of physics would still be the same.\n work. Now this gave physicists some comfort until in 1964 it was found that some particles can also violate the combined charge parity symmetry and boom you got yourself another Nobel Prize. Now two rules which physicists\n once thought were fundamental laws of nature were broken. So they retreated behind their last set of theoretical defenses, the combined symmetry of CPT, where T is time. Sure, they said, the weak force violates parity and charge parity.\n but certainly not charge parity and time together. And to this day physicists are still pretty sure that CPT is a real symmetry of the universe. So far no experiment has found a violation of CPT. In fact if CPT is violated\n we would have to rewrite a lot of the last century's work because it would mean that special relativity and quantum field theory are both wrong. Okay, so let's say that CPT is a true symmetry. Think about the implications of this. If we know that CP can be violated but\n but CPT cannot, then time symmetry must also be broken. Otherwise, there would be no way for the combined three-way symmetry to be maintained while two of the sub-symmetries are broken. And physicists have actually conducted experiments that confirm that\n certain particles directly break time symmetry. For example, when a pair of quarks are held together by the strong force, there are sometimes two different possible arrangements, and they can switch back and forth between these two arrangements via the weak force. But switching\n one direction takes longer than switching back. So if you could make a recording of this event, it would look different if you played the recording forwards than if you played it backwards. And that's exactly what it means to break time symmetry. In certain cases then, fundamental part\n can tell the difference between going forwards and backwards in time. The second law of thermodynamics is not the only physical process that prefers one direction in time. Now is this the origin of our perception that time only goes one way?\n Or is it the reason for the universe's arrow of time? The truth is that we still have no idea why time only goes in one direction. What's interesting is that physicists once thought that parity, charge, and time were the symmetries that were unbreakable.\n But over time, each of these symmetries was demonstrably violated. So is the ultimate symmetry CPT also unbreakable? Or will it fall, taking quantum field theory and special relativity with it? These are just some of the big bases.\n unresolved mysteries left in our quest to understand the universe. Perhaps one day another physicist will give up their vacation to figure out the answer. This episode of Veritasium was animated and co-written\n by my friend Jorge Cham, who is also the creator of PhD comics, and now he's written a book.\n all the little things like what are all those fundamental particles for? And it has cartoons in it. Yep and lots of bad puns. So if that sounds like it's up your alley you should check it out I'll put a link to it in the description and all of Jorge's other projects.

            "transcription": "1.3 billion years ago, in a galaxy far, far away, two black holes merged. As they violently spiraled into each other, they created traveling distortions in the fabric of space-time, gravitational waves.\n In the last tenth of a second, the energy released in these waves was 50 times greater than the energy being released by everything else in the observable universe combined. It's like an awe-inspiring kind of energy. After spreading out through the universe at the speed of light,\n For over a billion years, the waves reached Earth, where they stretched and squeezed space such that two light beams traveling in perpendicular pipes were put slightly out of step, allowing humans to detect the existence of gravitational waves for the first time.\n That's a simple enough story to tell, but what I found out when I went to visit Professor Rana Adhikari at Caltech is that it hides the absurdity of just what\n was required to make that detection? There's a lot of things about gravitational waves which are absurd. Is that is it?\n That's it.\n trying to measure variations in that distance that are the width of a human hair. To detect such tiny wiggles you have to measure over as large a distance as possible which is why the arms of the interferometers are four kilometers. And even with arms\n For arms this long, gravitational waves vary the length of the arms by at most 10 to the minus 18 meters. So the detector has to be able to reliably measure distances just one ten-thousandth the width of a proton. It's the tiniest measurement ever made.\n How is it possible to measure that, considering all the other sources of vibrations and noise in the environment, like earthquakes, traffic, and electrical storms? Well, for one thing, the mirrors are the smoothest ever created. They weigh 40 kg, or 90 lbs, and are suspended by\n silica threads, just twice the thickness of a hair, to isolate them from their environment. And even then, the only way to be certain not to be tricked by environmental noise was to build two detectors far apart from each other in reasonably quiet locations. That allows you to\n distinguish between the local noise, which would appear at only one site, and gravitational waves, which would pass through both sites almost simultaneously.\n The next challenge is the laser. You need a laser that can provide one and exactly one wavelength.\n wavelength is changing and you're trying to use interference of light waves to make this measurement, it's never going to work because it's something like trying to measure this distance but your ruler stick is constantly changing back and forth. You can't tell how many inches this is. All this equipment\n At least three quarters of it. All we're trying to do is make the laser more stable and by the end of the day what we've achieved is something which has a stability of one part in 10 to the 20. What does that mean? That's a hundred billion\n The best lasers for this purpose have a wavelength of 1064 nanometers, that's infrared light. But this presents a problem. How can you measure 10 to the minus 18 with 10 to the minus 6 straight length of light?\n I wish more people would ask this question. It's great for this animation to show such a large shift in the wavelength, but the reality is it's only one trillionth of a wavelength that the arms are shifting in length. It seems obvious that you can measure half a wavelength because\n Because that'll cause the light to interfere with itself. Yeah, but that's fully that'll go from completely dark to completely bright So are you looking at like slightly darker and slightly brighter? Yeah, and the limit here to how good we can measure this difference between dark and dark\n The variation in the number of photons hitting the mirrors at any instant due to this quantum uncertainty is proportional to the square root of the total number of photons.\n What this means is the more photons you use, the smaller the uncertainty gets as a fraction of the total. This is why the laser power in the arms is 1 megawatt. That is enough energy to power a thousand homes.\n in a light beam. And a megawatt, you know, boom. It won't even rip your head off, you just vaporize. It'll be just a smoking stump. Even with a perfect laser and one megawatt of power, anything the light hits would interfere with it, even the air.\n air. So all the air in the arms of the detectors had to be eliminated. It took 40 days to pump down to just a trillionth of atmospheric pressure. The tubes were heated up to the temperature of an oven to expel any residual gases. They pumped\n out enough air to fill up 2.5 million footballs, making it the second largest vacuum in the world after the Large Hadron Collider. Now here's something most people don't think about, which is that gravitational waves stretch space time, so light traveling through that space\n should be stretched as well. If everything is stretching, how do you know anything is stretching? How do you know anything is stretching? That's the conundrum. It doesn't make any sense. This thing, this whole thing is bogus. Shut it down. I would send the laser beam down this tube.\n and then wait for it to come back and then I would say well nothing happened because the space got stretched and the laser wavelength got stretched it's it looks the same if it got stretched or not stretched. Does it make any sense? Well it's sort of a matter of timing is how it works.\n So the amount of time it takes for light to go down this tube and come back is very short. However, the gravitational wave when it comes through, it's doing this slow thing like this noise I made, which is\n It's a slow stretching, it's only 100 times per second. And it's true when the wave comes through, the light which is in there, it actually does get stretched. And then that part doesn't do the measurement for us.\n And now that the space has stretched, that laser light is like come and gone, it's out of the picture. We're constantly shooting the laser back into the system. So the new fresh light now goes through there and has to travel a bigger distance than the light before. And so by looking at how this interference\n So what was needed to detect gravitational waves? Well, a megawatt of laser power to minimize shot noise of exactly one wavelength because we're trying to\n measure just a trillionth of that wavelength. Continually inserted to replace older light that's been stretched and squished in the world's second largest vacuum chamber at just a trillionth of atmospheric pressure, hitting the smoothest mirrors ever created suspended by silica threads at two distance\n sites to eliminate noise, with 4km long arms to increase the magnitude of gravitational waves to just a thousandth of the width of a proton.\n One of the things that was most interesting for me to learn was what is limiting the sensitivity of the detectors today. And it turns out it is quantum mechanics and essentially you can think of it like a Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We've got two things and together their uncertainty happens.\n to be bigger than a certain value. Luckily for us we're only trying to measure one thing here. We're not trying to measure two things at the same time. All we want to know is how much more did this arm get stretched from that arm and that's that's the key point which people did not understand until recently.\n The way to build these systems is such that they're extremely good in measuring one thing and that all of the uncertainty which comes from quantum mechanics is completely crammed into this other thing that we don't care about. I feel like we're getting down to these levels of nature\n where it seems like nature doesn't want you to go any further, but through our ingenuity we're figuring out ways to engineer quantum noise. I think that's such a remarkable concept and I look forward to the results that it's going to bring. I think the next\n The logical step is to go from two signals to detecting all the black holes in the universe all of the time. It's not like an alien civilization level of technology. It's just we have to do a lot better than what we're doing now, but I see it sort of within\n within our grasp.\n you"

But most of your mass doesn't come from the Higgs mechanism and neither does all of the stuff that you see or\n around\n quarks and their interactions with each other through gluons is called quantum chromodynamics. And chromo is the Greek word for color. So in some way these objects are meant to carry the color charge. But they are much much smaller than the wavelength of visible\n So there's no way that they are actually colored, but it's a useful analogy that helps us think about how they interact and the particles that they can make up. Now the rules are pretty simple. In order for a particle to exist, it must be colorless or white, like this house.\n You can accomplish that in two different ways. You could make three quarks where each one is a different color, red, green and blue, so overall they combine to produce white. Or you could use a quark and an anti-quark where one is a color like green and\n The other is its anti-color, say magenta. Now what I'd like to do on this little patch of beach behind me is simulate how corks actually bind together and form different particles. Now for this you need to remember that in the last video we talked about\n how empty space is not truly empty. So the beach here has these undulations in it which represent the fluctuations in the gluon field. But you have to imagine this beach sort of rippling and these bumps coming and going. Now that's really important because to get rid of those\n actually takes energy and this is an important part of binding the quarks together. The existence of quarks actually suppresses the gluon fluctuations and creates what's called a flux tube, an area where there is really nothing in the vacuum.\n And that's in between this quark and the anti quark and that pairs them up and creates what's called a meson the quark anti quark pair What's interesting about the flux tube is that as these quarks become more separated the flux tube remains the same diameter and the same sort of\n depth of suppression of the field, which means that the force doesn't actually increase. It's not like a spring, it's not like an elastic band. The force is the same that is pulling these quarks back together. But you are putting more work in as you move these quarks and any quarks further apart.\n And so for a time people thought well these quarks are always going to be confined however far you move them you're just going to get a really long flux tube. But what actually happens is that you put in enough energy that you can actually create a quark-antiquark pair.\n Now to form a proton we're going to need an up quark, another up\n cork and a down cork. Now the standard model of a proton that you've probably seen involves these corks bounded together by little glue on springs that go between them.\n that you would see flex tubes around the edge of the triangle, but we know that in fact they don't do that. You get these Y-shaped flex tubes. The crazy thing about a proton is that there may be more than three quarks there.\n You see, you can have additional quark-antiquark pairs pop in and out of existence. So at any given time there could be five or seven or nine, any odd number of quarks could make up the proton. So this is what a proton actually looks like.\n looks like. You can see that the quarks like to sit on those lumps in the gluon field and you can see the two up quarks and a down quark but there's also a strange quark and an anti-strange quark which is strange because you don't normally think of these quarks being inside\n a proton, but they can be at any particular point in time. You can also see that these quarks have cleared out the vacuum, and you can see there's kind of these flux tubes, which are the areas where the gluon field has been suppressed, and that's really what's binding these quarks together.\n That's the strong force that binds quarks into the heart of the proton. It is intrinsically related to the fact that clearing out those fluctuations has more energy than where they are. That's right. It causes\n So where is the mass of the proton really coming from? Well of course the constituent quarks do interact with the Higgs field and that gives them a small amount of mass. But if you add up the mass of all the quarks in the proton\n it would only account for about 1% of its total mass. So where's the rest of the mass coming from? The answer is energy. You know Einstein's famous equation E equals MC squared. Well that says we got a lot of energy for just\n a little bit of mass. But if you rearrange the equation, you can see that we can get an amount of mass if there is lots of energy there. And that is really where most of the mass of the proton is coming from. It's from the fact that there are these energy fluctuations\n in the gluon field and the quarks are interacting with those gluons, that is where your mass is coming from. It's coming from the energy that's in there. You know, Einstein talked about, well if I had a hot cup of tea, it would actually have a slightly greater mass than the same cup of tea\n when cold. And he was right. I mean you can't measure it with a cup of tea. But most of your mass you owe to E equals MC squared. You owe to the fact that your mass is packed with energy because of the interactions between the quarks and these gluon\n in that glue-on field. I think it's extraordinary because what we think of as ordinarily empty space, you know, that turns out to be the thing that gives us all most of our mass.

            "transcription": "Thermometry is kind of a key safety diagnostic to make sure that we're well controlled. Thermometry. Thermometry. What, if it gets too hot you're in trouble or? Sodium expands when it heats. The vessel has a certain volume. There's a temperature above which it's over full.\n And it's better not to be over full. What temperature is that? Uh, I think it's around 130 degrees. Have you ever been close? No. No, because our thermometries have, we have thermometry and backup thermometry and backup to the backup thermometry.\n Back up and explain what is this thing. This is a three meter sphere of molten sodium. That is 12.5 tons of hot liquid metal designed to spin at up to four revolutions per second.\n And at that rate the outer surface of the sphere is moving at over a hundred and thirty kilometers an hour That's over 80 miles per hour And basically it's representing the earth what they're trying to do is find\n out how the Earth's magnetic field is generated. Some of the first scientists to study this, starting with William Gilbert in 1600, proposed that the Earth was a huge permanent magnet. Now today we know that the inner core of the Earth is solid,\n and it's mostly made up of iron and nickel, which are ferromagnetic elements. However, the temperature of the intercore is nearly 6000 Kelvin, which is way above their Curie temperatures, and so there is no way that they could maintain a permanent magnetic field.\n And this is what is modeled by the 3 meter spinning sphere\n of molten sodium.\n The failure would be modestly catastrophic. That's kind of a weird twist of phrase, but it's... Modestly catastrophic. Most buildings have sprinkler systems in case of fire, but not this lab. To see why, take a look at a single drop of water.\n falling on a single drop of molten sodium. Now multiply that by 12.5 tons and you have modestly catastrophic. But the researchers have thought about this and they have a plan.\n liquid nitrogen doer that sits up top. So one of these mostly full, you can just hit a switch and dump the entire contents of liquid nitrogen on top of the experiment. So this is like a physicist super fire extinguisher then? You know, it's a backup plan. The plan is no leak, no fire.\n the backup plan, put the fire out, cryogenics. It actually works great. This is 300 degrees colder than the sodium and so sodium cannot burn nitrogen gas atmosphere and the cold freezes it and the leak gets frozen and everything just\n But when everything's working normally, how is a spinning sphere of liquid metal meant to generate a magnetic field? Well, for the Earth, the thinking goes like this. First, as the Earth radiates heat into space, it's core\n This means the solid inner core is growing, as iron and nickel from the outer core solidify at the boundary. Now this leaves some lighter elements, like sulfur for example, behind in the outer core, and so patches with those lighter elements\n experience a buoyant force and rise away from the core in turbulent convection currents. Now add to this the fact that the earth is rotating. The rotation causes those convection currents to spiral around an axis roughly parallel with the earth's axis\n of rotation. These spiraling turbulent flows of liquid metal can trap magnetic field lines, and as they move and stretch the field, they create electric currents that produce more magnetic fields. If the magnetic fields are generated\n faster than they dissipate due to the resistance of the metal, well then you have a self-sustaining electric generator or a dynamo. We talk about the dynamo generation of magnetic fields to mean when you have a turbulent conductor, let's say\n convecting like the core that spontaneously generates a magnetic field. If you have a little bit of current that happens, it causes a little bit of magnetic field that couples into the motion, that causes more currents, cause more magnetic fields, that couples into the motion, and then you're just converting motion\n to currents. But it goes unstable. That's kind of counterintuitive though, because you started out with no magnetic fields, so how do you get the current in the first place? You know what I mean? No, no, all you need is a little infinitesimal amount, a thermal variation, a random\n current will just grow to full size. So once something's unstable, actually you don't really care where the tickle came from. The states we have now don't generate their own magnetic fields, so we've not reached the dynamo threshold, although the hope is to do so in a modified version of the experiment.\n So we apply magnetic fields from the outside and then look at the amplification of those magnetic fields by the rotating turbulence. And we get copious amounts of amplification depending on where we are in the operating conditions. For instance, when we apply these external magnetic fields sort of\n go through the experiment like that, they get twisted up by the flow and the magnetic fields in the angular direction can be up to 10 times larger than the fields we apply. So we actually have lots of gain even though we do not yet have a closed-loop dynamo. So why is it important\n to understand the Earth's magnetic field. But lately, that shield\n field appears to be weakening.\n history, we don't know where it's going now. We actually don't currently have a predictive science of the Earth's magnetic field. Why is that important? So the Earth's magnetic field has weather, it has changes, you might want to have a forecast for\n Will this spinning sphere make that forecasting possible?\n In fact, we don't know whether it's possible or not to predict the Earth's future magnetic field. It's an open question. Hey, so in about a week I am taking the 13-hour flight to Sydney. I am touring the country\n and launching a new feature-length documentary.

            "transcription": "This video contains the answers to my four revolutionary riddles. So if you haven't seen the riddles yet, you should probably watch them before you watch the answers. It's okay, I'll wait. Just click this card up here.\n When I filmed the riddles, I also filmed the solutions at the same time, but that was before I received your 15,000 comments and dozens of video responses. So I'm reshooting parts of this solutions video to incorporate the results I saw in the comments and to use\n some of your video responses to help explain the solutions. Let's get to it. Okay, by looking at the comments for number one, over 15% of you said a cylinder containing sand. Now this contains some powder, see how it\n rolls. It doesn't seem to roll very far before it stops and then it won't roll again because I think the sand just kind of levels off in there. Maybe you were thinking a bigger\n kind of sand like this small gravelly stones. Let's try that. That actually rolls pretty well. Nearly 25% of you said a\n a cylinder half full of water. So let's try that. This rolls very well, so it's not water. And nearly 45% of you said a cylinder half full of a\n viscous liquid here. I have a half full container of honey. So let's see how it rolls. That's not bad. It's rolling and it's stopping. And it's rolling some more.\n This is a pretty good guess, and I think the behavior is not exactly the same as the mystery cylinder, but it definitely is similar. And that's no coincidence. The mystery cylinder actually contains\n honey and ping pong balls. There are two ping pong balls submerged in this honey. So if I place that on the ramp, the center of gravity is not above the point of contact\n contact with the ramp and so it rolls forward. But now because those ping pong balls are in the front, they change the center of gravity and so it's exactly under the point of contact. And so it stops briefly. But then as the\n The viscosity of the honey allows those ping pong balls to move up. The center of gravity shifts forwards again, allowing this little container to roll. So that is the trick of the mystery cylinder. Pretty easy if you want to try it out at home.\n challenged you to run two laps of this track, where the first lap you could go as slowly as you like, but the second lap you had to go much faster, such that your total average speed was twice the speed of your first lap. Now when I was first asked this question by Simon Pampana, it took\n be a long time and scribbling on paper and just something didn't seem to work out. And that's because you can't actually do this. It's impossible. I mean, you might think I could run 3v1 for my second\n and that would mean my total average speed is 2 v 1. The problem is you can't just add the two velocities together and divide by 2 because you spent much more time in your first lap so that velocity is weighted more heavily into the average. So you'd have to run\n run, well, impossibly fast. Let me explain. The velocity of the first lap was the distance around the track divided by T1, the time it took you. Now, if you want your total average time to be twice V1, well then it needs to be two\n You need to run twice the distance in the same amount of time as it took you to run the first lap. But you've already run that first lap, and so you have no time remaining to run the second lap. Even if you went the speed of light, you would not be able to increase the speed of light.\n increase your total average speed up to twice the velocity of your first lap. It is just mathematically impossible. So this may seem like a bit of a trick question, but the point to me is how doable it sounds, how it\n seems like something you should be able to do, but you can't. It's actually impossible. Riddle number four, the question about the train, was actually answered pretty well, with most people mentioning something to do with the wheels. But of course that makes sense in a\n series of riddles which are about rotation, rotational motion. Some people though did point out that maybe it was the steam that was going backwards or maybe air molecules in the train and that is actually a pretty clever point, however I wouldn't really consider it\n the air in the train part of the train. So indeed, the part of the train that is moving backwards is the flange part of the wheel which is below the rail. That is the part of the train which is moving backwards.\n To understand why, you just think about a spinning wheel. The top of the wheel is moving forwards at speed 2V, and the bottom of the wheel is not moving forward at all. It is stationary with respect to the track. And that is what we call rolling without slipping.\n that's how most wheels work, at least that's how they're designed to work. Now in the case of trains, they have to have flanges so the train doesn't fall off its rails. But of course when these pieces come around during the rotation of the wheel, they actually extend\n beyond the rail and therefore they are going backwards with respect to the ground. So the part of the train that's moving backwards is always changing, but it's always that part of the flange, that part that extends beyond the wheel, that is below the level\n of the track. So what happens when you pull the bottom pedal of a bike backwards? Well about 45% of you thought that the bike would move backwards, about a quarter said it would move forwards, and a quarter said the bike wouldn't move\n at all. Five percent said it depends on something. Let's give it a shot and see what happens. I'm going to pull backwards on the bike pedal in three, two, one.\n Whoa! The bike did indeed move back and for virtually all bikes this is what you will find but the explanation is not just as simple as well the net force on the bike is back so therefore it has to accelerate backwards and to prove\n that that logic doesn't work. We'll just have a look at this video by George Hart. Watch this. Again, I pull the same pedal backward, but now the bike moves forward. I'll put a link to the full video here and a link to his website in the description.\n description.\n The pedal, even when you're pushing back on it, never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground. It's always moving forwards. So if you drag a string behind the pedal of a bike moving forward, the string is always moving forward.\n Now just play that movie backward in your mind, and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward. They move forward together, so they move backward together. Another way to think about this is to consider the path traced out by the pedal as the bike moves forward.\n For all ordinary bikes, the pedals are moving much slower than the tires, so the pedal is always going forward with respect to the ground. But George modified his bike so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front spring.\n rocket to the back sprocket. This ultra-low gear changes the trochoid so the pedal does actually go backwards with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards. That's why he could pull back on the pedal and make the bike go forwards.\n This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel, you could actually get the train to move forwards, if you pulled backwards with enough force. For all normal bicycles, pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move\n backwards. But depending on the gear ratio, you can get the bike to move forwards. So it was those people who said it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back wheel that were actually the most correct.\n Bye!\n you"

Now all of you out there know what an atom looks like, right? It looks like this.\n So, am I right? No, I'm wrong! That's called the Bohr-Summerfeld atom. That's what an atom looked like back in the 1920s. And ever since the introduction of quantum mechanics towards the end of the 20s, that's\n obsolete. It's 90 years old. It's ancient and yet people still think of this as the picture of the atom. I prefer to think of this as the hula hoop atom.\n Now the thing that really bugs me is that corporations and even some research institutions when they want to convince you that they're at the cutting edge they go and stick a couple of these hula hoop atoms in their corporate logo.\n You would be like Apple advertising their iPhone by showing you a candlestick telephone. It's crazy! What's a better way of representing the atom? Instead of these hula hoop orbits, you should think of the electrons as buzzing around the nucleus\n in a fuzzy little cloud, an electron cloud. Have a look at this. So imagine we have this fuzzy spherical thing a bit like that. We can chop it up into a whole bunch of pieces. We can chop it up into spherical bits called s-orbitals. These more complicated\n things called p orbitals and these ring-like, these things that look like calamari that we call d orbitals. So what do these orbitals mean? Basically that fuzziness tells you the probability that there's an electron there because quantum mechanics says at any given moment\n we can't tell you exactly where an electron is going to be and what speed it's going. All we can do is calculate the probability it's going to be at some point, the probability it has a certain speed and so on. And those electron clouds represent that fuzzy probability. That's not the only way that you can chop up the electron\n cloud. What I showed you is typically the way that physicists do it. Chemists mathematically chop up their electron clouds using a different set of orbitals. This is an S orbital, spherical thing. This is a P orbital, a dumbbell-shaped\n pointing in all sorts of directions. And here's a couple of examples of D orbitals. So, my advice to the marketing department of some great corporation that wants to show you how cutting\n edge they are is that instead of using hula hoop atoms, they should include balloon animals in their corporate logos.

            "transcription": "In the 1930s Albert Einstein was upset with quantum mechanics. He proposed a thought experiment where according to the theory an event at one point in the universe could instantaneously affect another event arbitrarily\n He called this spooky action at a distance because he thought it was absurd. It seemed to imply faster than light communication, something his theory of relativity ruled out. But nowadays we can do this experiment.\n and what we find is indeed spooky. But in order to understand it, we must first understand spin. All fundamental particles have a property called spin. No, they're not actually spinning, but the analogy is a\n They have angular momentum and they have an orientation in space. Now we can measure the spin of a particle, but we have to choose the direction in which to measure it. And this measurement can have only one of two outcomes. Either the particle spin is aligned with the direction of measurement, which\n we'll call spin up or it is opposite the measurement which we'll call spin down. Now what happens if the particles spin is vertical but we measure it spin horizontally? Well then it has a 50% chance of being spin up and a 50%\n chance of being spinned down. And after the measurement, the particle maintains this spin. So measuring its spin actually changes the spin of the particle. What if we measure spin at an angle 60 degrees from the vertical?\n Well now since the spin of the particle is more aligned to this measurement, it will be spin up three quarters of the time and spin down one quarter of the time. The probability depends on the square of the cosine of half the angle. Now an experiment like the one Einstein\n proposed can be performed using two of these particles, but they must be prepared in a particular way. For example, formed spontaneously out of energy. Now since the total angular momentum of the universe must stay constant,\n You know that if one particle is measured to have spin up, the other, measured in the same direction, must have spin down. I should point out it's only if the two particles are measured in the same direction that their spins must be opposite. Now here's where things start to get a little weird.\n weird. You might imagine that each particle is created with a definite well-defined spin, but that won't work and here's why. Imagine their spins were vertical and opposite. Now if they're both measured in the horizontal direction, each one has a\n chance of being spin up. So there's actually a 50% chance that both measurements will yield the same spin outcome and this would violate the law of conservation of angular momentum. According to quantum mechanics these particles don't have a well-defined spin at\n at all. They are entangled, which means their spin is simply opposite that of the other particle. So when one particle is measured and its spin determined, you immediately know what the same measurement of the other particle will be. This has\n rigorously and repeatedly tested experimentally. It doesn't matter at which angle the detectors are set or how far apart they are, they always measure opposite spins. Now just stop for a minute and think about how crazy this is. Both\n Both particles have undefined spins and then you measure one and immediately you know the spin of the other particle which could be light years away. It's as though the choice of the first measurement has influenced the result of the second faster than the speed of light.\n Which is indeed how some theorists interpret the result. But not Einstein. Einstein was really bothered by this. He preferred an alternate explanation that all along the particles contained hidden information about which spin they would have if made\n in any direction. It's just that we didn't know this information until we measured them. Now since that information was within the particles from the moment they formed at the same point in space, no signal would ever have to travel between the two particles faster than light.\n Now for a time scientists accepted this view that there were just some things about the particles we couldn't know before we measured them But then along came John Bell with a way to test this idea This experiment can determine whether the particles contain hidden particles\n information all along or not. And this is how it works. There are two spin detectors each capable of measuring spin in one of three directions. These measurement directions will be selected randomly and independent of each other. Now pairs of entangled\n particles will be sent to the two detectors and we record whether the measured spins are the same, both up or both down, or different. We'll repeat this procedure over and over randomly varying those measurement directions to find the percentage of the time the two detectors\n give different results. And this is the key, because that percentage depends on whether the particles contain hidden information all along or if they don't. Now to see why this is the case, let's calculate the expected frequency of different\n readings if the particles do contain hidden information. Now you can think of this hidden information like a secret plan the particles agree to and the only criterion that plan must satisfy is that if the particles are ever measured in the same direction they must give\n opposite spins. So for example one plan could be that one particle will give spin up for every measurement direction and its pair would give spin down for every measurement direction. Or another plan, plan two, could be that one particle could give spin up for the first direction so\n spin down for the second direction and spin up for the third direction. Whereas its partner would give spin down for the first direction, spin up for the second direction and spin down for the third direction. All other plans are mathematically equivalent, so we can work out the expected frequency of different results using these two\n plans. Here I'm visually representing the particles by their plans, their hidden information. With plan 1 the results will obviously be different 100% of the time. It doesn't matter which measurement directions are selected, but it does for particles using the second plan\n For example, if both detectors measure in the first direction, particle A gives spin up while particle B gives spin down. The results are different. But if instead detector B measured in the second direction, the result would be spin up. So the spins are the same. We can continue doing this for all the\n possible measurement combinations and what we find is the results are different five out of nine times. So using the second plan the results should be different five-ninths of the time and using the first plan the results should be different a hundred percent of the time. So\n Overall if the particles contain hidden information you should see different results more than five-ninths of the time So what do we actually see an experiment? Well the results are different only 50% of the time\n It doesn't work. So the experiment rules out the idea that all along these particles contain hidden information about which spin they will give in the different directions. So how does quantum mechanics account for this result?\n Well, let's imagine detector A measures spin in the first direction and the result is spin up. Now immediately you know that the other particle is spin down if measured in the first direction, which should happen randomly one third of the time.\n Remember, if particle B is measured in one of the other two directions, it makes an angle of 60 degrees with these measurement directions. And recall from the beginning of this video, the resulting measurement should be spin up three quarters of the time. Since these measurement directions will be randomly\n selected two-thirds of the time, particle B will give spin up two-thirds times three-quarters equals half of the time. So both detectors should give the same results half of the time and different results half of the time, which is exactly what we see\n in the experiment. So quantum mechanics works, but there is debate over how to interpret these results. Some physicists see them as evidence that there is no hidden information in quantum particles, and it only makes sense to talk about\n once they've been measured. Whereas other physicists believe that entangled particles can signal each other faster than light to update their hidden information when one is measured. So does this mean that we can use entangled particles to communicate faster than light?\n Well, everyone agrees that we can't. And that is because the results that you find at either detector are random. It doesn't matter which measurement direction you select or what's happening at the other detector. There's a 50-50 probability\n of obtaining spin up or spin down. Only if these observers later met up and compared notebooks would they realize that when they selected the same direction they always got opposite spins. Both sets of data would be random just the opposite\n it random from the other observer. That is indeed spooky, but it doesn't allow for the communication, the sending of information from one point to another faster than light, so it doesn't violate the theory of relativity. And that\n at the very least, would make Einstein happy.\n you"

This is a counter-intuitive idea for most people because they confuse the concepts of velocity and acceleration.\n At the bottom of the jump, the velocity is virtually zero, but acceleration is not. So what is acceleration? It is the rate at which velocity changes over time. It is very difficult for us to spot just by looking at it because\n our eyes track motion smoothly. So you have to think about the velocity at two different times. Right before the jumper reached his lowest point, he was going down, but after he reached it, he was going up. So while he was right at the bottom\n his velocity was changing rapidly. In other words, while velocity was minimal, it was changing at the greatest rate. The key is to keep the two ideas separate, velocity and the rate at which it changes.\n you"

            "transcription": "Now you've probably heard of the Leidenfrost effect. That's when a volatile droplet like water levitates over a hot surface because it's floating on a little cushion of its own vapor. Here I'm going to try to create the inverse Leidenfrost effect.\n where we levitate a droplet on a bath of liquid nitrogen. It's inverse because the droplet is not actually creating the vapor, it's the bath beneath, it's the liquid nitrogen that's creating the vapor. There have been a couple of recent papers about this phenomenon, so I call\n I called up one of the scientists to ask, how can I do this? And how does it work?\n replicate this without too much difficulty? If you have liquid nitrogen, yes, it's really simple. It's really basic. What you need is a polystyrene box, like 20 by 20 centimeters, a bit thick that it insulates, and then I have two beakers\n one like that size and another one that is smaller in which the experiments. So two beakers.\n have a look at this setup. I have a piece of Styrofoam that has a cylindrical cutout in it into which I have poured some liquid nitrogen. And the purpose of that is to get this outer space as cold as possible and insulated\n from the rest of the air. Then I have this large beaker that is full of liquid nitrogen. As you can see it is boiling and then I have the innermost beaker which is not boiling so I have still liquid nitrogen in the middle that\n is not boiling. And that is what I want because that is where we can actually conduct the experiment and try to get the inverse Leidenfrost effect to work. Okay, I have a hundred\n microliters of silicon oil and I'm gonna attempt to drop it onto this bath of liquid nitrogen. Whoa! Oh my god! Look at that! What?! There were a whole bunch of droplets and they were all levitating\n on the surface. Now that they are in there, now the liquid nitrogen is boiling so this is not good. Hey, Future Derek here. Sorry my hair looks stupid, I'm gonna go get it cut. But that last experiment didn't go very well because the\n liquid nitrogen in the middle beaker was boiling and there was nothing I could do about it so I tested a few droplets on there but you couldn't really see the effect nicely because of that boiling bath so I'm gonna try again today clean beakers new liquid nitrogen let's give it a shot\n There it is. Got his droplet of silicon oil and it is bouncing around back and forth. That is pretty cool.\n What's amazing about this effect is that it can continue almost indefinitely. It's been observed to last for tens of minutes. Unlike the Leidenfrost effect where the droplet is used up making the vapor cushion that supports it, here the supporting vapor comes from the back.\n bath, so it can continue indefinitely even after the drop has frozen. The heat required to evaporate the bath comes not only from the droplet but also from the warm atmosphere around the experiment.\n On my second attempt I was able to prevent the small beaker of liquid nitrogen from boiling. My setup was a bit unstable so the boiling in the outer beaker shook the inner beaker interfering with the droplets motion. But in Ana\u00efs's professional setup you can see how the drop always moves\n moves in straight lines. But why should the droplet be moving at all? And what keeps it moving?\n How did you explain it?\n point, there is a tiny instability, like a capillary wave that grows under it. But why is there a wave? Just for example, because you never deposit the drop perfectly nicely and\n I think you can see that here as I add a droplet to the bath. Notice the waves generated in the middle of the beaker? These little waves lead to an asymmetry underneath the droplet, where one\n side is higher than the other. More nitrogen gas escapes out this side. Now you might think this would drive the droplet in the opposite direction, but it doesn't. The gas actually drags the droplet along with it, kind of like how wind over your windshield\n field pushes raindrops along.\n liquid nitrogen meniscus. So the drop starts to climb in and then the propelling force reverses and then pushes it back. And this creates a nice star pattern. So it's like self-propelled forever and repelled from the walls,\n which is very cool. So do you think this research has applications and what sort of applications might those be? If you imagine an embryo of an animal like a mouse or something, a very very young embryo is like\n So it's incredibly small. So what they do is like they put it into liquid that allows cryopreservations and then freeze it. And what is great about this is what they do is they take the drop and put it into liquid nitrogen and then it freezes.\n And if the freezing is fast enough, you don't grow ice crystals, so you preserve the embryo. And what is great about this is, like, if you imagine, instead of just putting an oil drop where\n What I did is you put an embryo with the cryopreservance on the liquid bath, then you can make it into a canal like this, and then you can generate them in a random way and move them around.\n they are self-propelled so they would go in the direction that you want them to move.

Will it go not as high or will it go higher?\n Okay, so versus being shot in the middle when you shoot on the side is the question, right? Yeah, how high will it go in comparison? It depends on if the bullet stays in the block. And I'm assuming it does. It does stay in the block, yes. I guarantee you that. Same height.

I'll say higher, but it's gonna like fly in a different direction\n So you have angular momentum, which is L, and you have translational momentum, which is P.

And so the total energy of the system basically has to stay constant, and the kinetic plus potential, which would be the height it goes to, will have to be constant. So if it's spinning and has kinetic energy, it can't go as high. That's my prediction. So my prediction is\n it'll go up, not as high, but it'll spin more if it's hit to the side. Am I wrong?

            "transcription": "Okay. Hello. Like now you're moving. So this is good. This is good. You're working. Can you see me? I can see you. Do you know what went wrong in June?\n During the launch, yes, it's not complicated, but it's a long chain of events. On August 22nd, 2014, two satellites were launched by the European Space Agency. They're called Galileo satellites five and six. They were intended to become part\n the Global Navigation Satellite System, or GNSS. Now after successfully blasting off into space,\n with the Russian Soyuz rocket. The final stage of the rocket was set to inject the satellites into circular orbits around 23,000 kilometers above the earth. But that is when something went wrong. There was thermal breach.\n between a line of cold helium and a line of propellant. So the propellant, it froze? This caused the failure of the attitude control thrusters. The satellites seem to have been injected into some random direction. It was launched but in the wrong direction.\n This sent the satellites into highly elliptical and seemingly useless orbits. At a low point the satellites didn't really get a full view of Earth. Earth sensors which enable them to orient their navigation antennas stopped working because the Earth just\n filled their field of view. At the other extreme, the satellites went too high, experiencing significant radiation exposure due to the Van Allen belts. There was a threat that they would just shut them off. Okay, who do we have to talk to?\n They had an idea for how to use them to make the best test of general relativity to date.\n The satellites did have propellant on board, intended to allow for periodic course corrections over their planned 10-year lifespan, and they could use that fuel to attempt to correct their orbits.\n bring them in a stable orbit. But they didn't have enough to completely turn their elliptical orbits into circular ones. They couldn't circularize completely, hopefully for our project. According to general relativity, relative to a reference clock, clocks to\n slower in stronger gravitational fields. That is to say, closer to large masses like the Earth, deeper in gravitational wells. So, clocks and satellites should tick faster relative to those on Earth because they're in weaker gravitational fields. Here, I'm ignoring\n the special relativistic effect that works the other way, making clocks and satellites tick slower than those on Earth because they're moving so much faster. The gravitational effect is hard to measure precisely.\n for satellites in circular orbits, but satellites in elliptical orbits have an advantage. In every orbit they go from their lowest position, perigee, to the highest position, apogee, and back. If you want to test the gravitational redshift of a clock, you\n You need two things. You need a very accurate clock and you need a large change in gravitational potential. The satellite goes from 17,000 to 26,000 kilometers. The difference in altitude is almost 9,000 kilometers.\n meaning they are rapidly and repeatedly going from lower gravitational potential to higher gravitational potential and back. So clocks on board should be ticking slower when they're closer to the earth and then faster when they go to their high point and they'll keep oscillating back and forth.\n slower and faster relative to clocks on earth. Now what's great about this is it allows you to eliminate a lot of\n sources of error. Because you don't really care about the absolute accuracy of the clocks, all you want to know is the difference between the rate of ticking at the low point compared to the high point. And since it's the same clock making the measurements at both locations,\n you can eliminate a lot of errors like the noise in the clock or a systematic drift and that's what allowed the scientists to achieve such incredible precision. Why we could do it is because it's a periodic effect. Due to the eccentricity of the orbit the signal\n Now I should point out that if you were traveling with the satellite, for you time would not speed up and\n slow down, time would be passing at a constant rate. You wouldn't be able to measure any change in the rate the clock is ticking.\n curvature of space and time. Now the clocks on the satellites, there are a couple different types, are all atomic clocks. The primary clock typically is a passive hydrogen maser clock. A maser is just like a laser, except it uses microwaves.\n Atoms of hydrogen interact with one specific frequency of microwaves. A photon of precisely this frequency will flip the spin of an electron. So by tuning the microwaves so that they best interact with the hydrogen atoms,\n and then counting up exactly this number of cycles of that radiation, that's one second. You can keep track of time with incredible stability. In fact, over 30 million years a clock like this would not be out by more\n than a second. Again, if you were traveling with the satellite you would always observe the frequency of this radiation to be the same, but if you sent this radiation out to a distant observer who is not in a strong gravitational field, well they would observe\n the frequency of your microwaves to be slightly lower than those from their hydrogen maser. In other words, redshifted. And the closer the satellite is to Earth, the more redshifted the microwaves would appear. And hence the slower time would pass relatively\n to that distant observer. Locally, you cannot see any relativistic effect. This is called the equivalence principle. It's only when you compare the satellite clock to one on Earth that you would find the yo-yoing rate of the satellite\n due to its oscillation back and forth in Earth's gravitational well. This gravitational redshift was previously measured most precisely in 1976. That's right, for over 40 years we haven't improved our measurement of the gravitational\n effect on time. In 1976, Gravity Probe A was launched aboard a suborbital rocket. It went up in a parabolic trajectory reaching a maximum altitude of 10,000 kilometers and then it came down. That gives you quite a lot of\n The whole time it was in contact with the earth through the microwave signal from the onboard hydrogen maser. This allowed for a direct comparison\n of the rate at which a clock would tick on the rocket relative to a clock on Earth. The results matched the predictions of general relativity down to 140 parts per million. Now the scientists I'm talking to were eventually able to convince those in charge of the satellites to\n let them use their misfortune to test the gravitational redshift predictions of general relativity. But actually carrying out the test wasn't easy. One of the biggest sources of error was the positions of the satellites. Now you'd think in the emptiness of space the\n satellites would perfectly maintain their orbits. But that neglects the power of sunlight. That's right, the momentum of photons\n One way to improve the statistics was by collecting data over more than a thousand days.\n That's almost three years, unlike gravity probe A, which spent only two hours in space. So what did they find? I think we both agree that we did not prove relativity wrong. The result is that we confirmed the genesis.\n They were able to reduce the uncertainty in the measurement by a factor of 5 over gravity probe A. So it's a new high score, the first in over 40 years.\n What is the point? You say unfortunately. Yeah, you know what we are looking for is a deviation from general relativity because we know this is not the ultimate theory. History has taught us that new physics always\n lies at the boundaries, that more and more precise tests sometimes reveal brand new aspects of nature that we never would have observed if we had not made the effort to look. And there are good reasons to believe that general relativity may not be the whole story, both it and\n quantum mechanics are spectacularly successful theories in their own rights. But for nearly a century all attempts to merge the two have been more or less failures. Plus our current worldview includes dark energy and dark matter which make up more than 90% of\n everything there is in the universe. While more tests are planned to further probe general relativity and determine if there's a test it can't pass, a cold cesium atom clock is set\n to fly on the International Space Station and it aims to reduce the deviation by a further factor of 10. As for the satellites, their orbits were made more circular using the propellant on board though they are still elliptical. Their navigation signals have been tested and are within acceptable parameters.\n For the moment, they are restricted to test mode, awaiting some new software and modifications on the ground, but the hope is that they will be useful for navigation after all.

            "transcription": "On November 16th, representatives from nearly 60 nations will be meeting in Versailles, France to vote to change the definition of a kilogram. Not only that, they will also be changing the fundamental\n of temperature, the Kelvin, the unit for amount of substance, the mole, and the unit for electric current, the ampere. That is four of the seven base SI units in one day. And after that, all SI units will be based on fundamental constant\n of nature and not physical artifacts. The kilogram is the last base SI unit to be defined by a physical object. Since 1799, one kilogram has been defined as exactly the mass of\n of a single metal cylinder stored in Paris. It was swapped out once in 1889. But this International Prototype Kilogram, or Big K as it's affectionately known, has problems. I mean, weighing it with, in theory, identical cylinders?\n Scientists have found that their masses are diverging, so it doesn't even seem to maintain its mass. Plus, it's really hard to get access to big K, and that makes using this definition really difficult. So how do you create a mass standard\n that will never change and also be available to everyone everywhere. Well the solution is you set Planck's constant to have a fixed exact value. Now I know that sounds a little strange so bear with me for a moment. I mean Planck's constant\n is best known for relating the frequency of a photon, a particle of light, to its energy. But we also know that energy and mass are related through E equals MC squared. So hopefully you can see how Planck's constant is involved in\n in mass. But the problem, as it stands today, as I'm recording this video, is that Planck's constant has some uncertainty. I mean, we know the value of Planck's constant to a large number of decimal places, but those last couple of digits?\n They're actually uncertain. What is certain is the mass of that platinum iridium cylinder stored in a climate controlled vault in a basement in Paris. It is exactly one kilogram. No uncertainty.\n is to flip this on its head set planks constant to have an exact fixed value and then that cylinder in Paris will no longer be exactly one kilogram I mean it'll be a kilogram but not\n exactly. The thing that is now exact is Planck's constant which determines how big a kilogram is. But if you're gonna fix the value of Planck's constant well you better get that value right so that it\n consistent with all of our current measurements and all of the masses that exist in the world right now. And so for the last several years scientists around the world have used multiple different techniques to try to measure Planck's constant as accurately as they possibly\n can. One of the major methods was using a watt balance where essentially they balance the weight of a kilogram with the force from an electromagnet. If you want more detail you should check out my video on that topic.\n Scientists also created arguably the roundest object in the world made of one type of silicon atoms These methods have been complementary because now they're able to compare all of their different findings from physics and and from this more chemistry\n method of Avogadro's constant and determine what Planck's constant really should be. So if the vote goes well the future definition of Planck's constant will be that it is exactly this number. Planck's constant is fixed that's\n cylinder in Paris no longer exactly equal to a kilogram. But you can't redefine the kilogram in isolation because other base SI units depend on it. Take the mole for example. Currently the mole is defined as the amount\n of substance that contains the same number of particles as there are atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. That's Avogadro's constant. And it depends on what 12 grams is, which depends on what a kilogram is. So again,\n Again, Avogadro's constant currently has some uncertainty, but after the vote, the plan is to fix Avogadro's constant to be exactly this number, in such a way that it is internally consistent with the new definition of Planck's constant.\n direct relationship between Avogadro's constant and Planck's constant. Likewise, the ampere will no longer depend on the kilogram. Instead, it will be defined based on this newly fixed value for the charge on an electron, and the Kelvin will be based on the newly\n fixed Boltzmann constant which relates the temperature of a gas to the average kinetic energy of the molecules and this will be its exact value with no uncertainties. Now will these new definitions change anything? Well for most people\n No. I mean, your food is still going to the way the same as are you, and temperature is still going to work the same way. You know, everything basically stays the same. And that is as it should be. The point of this definition change is not to shape\n things up, but to keep things consistent and reliable forever. All we're doing is removing the dependence on a physical object, which theoretically at least makes it possible for anyone anywhere to make incredibly precise measurements.\n I should point out that a volt will actually change by about one part in 10 million, and resistance will change by a little bit less than that. And that's because back in 1990, the electrical metrologist decided to stop\n updating their value of, effectively, Planck's constant and just keep the one they had in 1990. And there was a benefit to that. They didn't have to update their definitions or their instruments. But now that we've realized that Planck's constant is actually slightly different than the 1990 value because of\n of better measurement techniques. Well, now the electrical metrologists will have to change, but that's a very tiny change for a very tiny number of people. I think they'll be fine. You know, I've been trying to ask myself the question, why am I so interested in this topic?\n I mean I made like four videos on it and the reason is you know to me the world and the universe is a big complicated place and when we're actually able to ascribe numbers to\n it. It's like we are resting some sort of order out of the chaos that is our universe and that is the beginning of our understanding of the way things work. You know, measurements are the foundation of science.\n They allow us to make observations. I think it's no surprise that Kepler was really able to figure out what was going on with the planets, that they were actually moving in elliptical orbits once Tycho Brahe had made the most accurate measurements of their positions that\n people had ever made. I mean I think that's no coincidence and if you look at the discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN or the the detection of gravitational waves these are in my view the pinnacle of human achievement.\n I think there are orders of magnitude greater than the achievements that we make in literature and art and fashion. And I don't say that to disparage those disciplines. I know that they're hard, I know they take a lot of human brain power, and I'm not saying scientists are smarter, but the\n tools that scientists work with and the system in which they work is what allows them to make such great leaps because science builds on itself in almost, you know, an exponentially improving way.\n And that to me is why this is so important. It's because it allows us to take our measurements to the next level. No longer are we bound to physical objects. I mean, face it, up until now we've essentially been doing a glorified version of\n Indiana Jones. Now we are taking that next leap to the abstraction that all of our units are based on the way nature is and the way the universe is. We're no longer tied to physical objects.\n Hey, this episode of Erotassium was supported by viewers like you on Patreon and by Audible.

            "transcription": "Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass. More about LastPass at the end of the show. The butterfly effect is the idea that tiny causes, like a flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil, can have huge effects like setting off a tornado in Texas.\n Now that idea comes straight from the title of a scientific paper published nearly 50 years ago. And perhaps more than any other recent scientific concept, it has captured the public imagination. I mean on IMDb there is not one but 61 different movies, TV episodes,\n and short films with Butterfly Effect in the title. Not to mention prominent references in movies like Jurassic Park or in songs, books, and memes. Oh, the memes. In pop culture, the Butterfly Effect has come to mean that even tiny,\n Seemingly insignificant choices you make can have huge consequences later on in your life. And I think the reason people are so fascinated by the butterfly effect is because it gets at a fundamental question, which is how well can we predict the future?\n Now the goal of this video is to answer that question by examining the science behind the butterfly effect. So if you go back to the late 1600s after Isaac Newton had come up with his laws of motion and universal gravitation, everything seemed predictable.\n I mean we could explain the motions of all the planets and moons, we could predict eclipses and the appearances of comets with pinpoint accuracy centuries in advance. French physicist Pierre-Simon Laplace summed it up in a famous thought experiment. He imagined a super intelligent\n intelligent being now called Laplace's demon that knew everything about the current state of the universe, the positions and momenta of all the particles and how they interact. If this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, he concluded,\n then the future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes. This is total determinism. The view that the future is already fixed. We just have to wait for it to manifest itself. I think if you've studied a bit of physics\n this is the natural viewpoint to come away with. I mean sure there's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics, but that's on the scale of atoms, pretty insignificant on the scale of people. Virtually all the problems I studied were ones that could be solved\n analytically, like the motion of planets or falling objects or pendulums, and speaking of pendulums, I want to look at a case of a simple pendulum here to introduce an important representation of dynamical systems, which is phase space.\n So some people may be familiar with position time or velocity time graphs, but what if we wanted to make a 2D plot that represents every possible state of the pendulum, every possible thing it could do in one graph? Well on the x-axis we can plot the angle of the pendulum\n And on the y-axis, it's velocity. And this is what's called phase space. If the pendulum has friction, it will eventually slow down and stop. And this is shown in phase space by the inward spiral. The pendulum swings slower and less far each time.\n And it doesn't really matter what the initial conditions are, we know that the final state will be the pendulum at rest hanging straight down. And from the graph, it looks like the system is attracted to the origin, that one fixed point. So this is called a fixed point attractor.\n Now if the pendulum doesn't lose energy, well it swings back and forth the same way each time and in phase space we get a loop. The pendulum is going fastest at the bottom but the swing is in opposite directions as it goes back and forth. The closed loop tells us the most\n is periodic and predictable. Anytime you see an image like this in phase space you know that the system regularly repeats. We can swing the pendulum with different amplitudes but the picture in phase space is very similar, just a different sized loop.\n Now an important thing to note is that the curves never cross in phase space and that's because each point uniquely identifies the complete state of the system and that state has only one future. So once you've defined the initial state the entire future is determined.\n Now the pendulum can be well understood using Newtonian physics, but Newton himself was aware of problems that did not submit to his equations so easily, particularly the three-body problem. So calculating the motion of the earth around the Sun was simple enough with just\n those two bodies, but add in one more, say the moon, and it became virtually impossible. Newton told his friend Haley that the theory of the motions of the moon made his head ache and kept him awake so often that he would think of it no more. The problem\n as would become clear to Henry Poincar\u00e9 200 years later, was that there was no simple solution to the three-body problem. Poincar\u00e9 had glimpsed what later became known as chaos.\n Chaos really came into focus in the 1960s when meteorologist Ed Lorenz tried to make a basic computer simulation of the Earth's atmosphere. He had 12 equations and 12 variables, things like temperature, pressure, humidity, and so on.\n computer would print out each time step as a row of 12 numbers so you could watch how they evolved over time. Now the breakthrough came when Lorenz wanted to redo a run but as a shortcut he entered the numbers from halfway through a previous printout and then he set\n the computer calculating. He went off to get some coffee and when he came back and saw the results, Lorenz was stunned. The new run followed the old one for a short while, but then it diverged. And pretty soon it was describing a totally different state of the atmosphere. I mean,\n totally different weather. Lorenz's first thought, of course, was that the computer had broken. Maybe a vacuum tube had blown, but none had. The real reason for the difference came down to the fact the printer rounded to three decimal places, whereas the computer calculated with six.\n So when he entered those initial conditions, the difference of less than one part in a thousand created totally different weather just a short time into the future. Now Lorenz tried simplifying his equations and then simplifying them some more, down to just three equations and three\n variables, which represented a toy model of convection, essentially a 2D slice of the atmosphere, heated at the bottom and cooled at the top. But again, he got the same type of behavior. If he changed the numbers just a tiny bit, the results diverged dramatically.\n Lorenzo's system displayed what's become known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which is the hallmark of chaos. Now since Lorenz was working with three variables, we can plot the phase space of his system in three dimensions. We can\n pick any point as our initial state and watch how it evolves. Does our point move toward a fixed attractor or a repeating loop? It doesn't seem to. In truth, our system will never revisit the same exact state again.\n Here I actually started with three closely spaced initial states and they've been evolving together so far, but now they're starting to diverge. From being arbitrarily close together they end up on totally different trajectories.\n This is sensitive dependence on initial conditions in action. Now I should point out that there is nothing random at all about this system of equations. It's completely deterministic, just like the pendulum. So if you could input exactly\n the same initial conditions you would get exactly the same result. The problem is, unlike the pendulum, this system is chaotic. So any difference in initial conditions, no matter how tiny, will be amplified to a totally different\n state. It seems like a paradox, but this system is both deterministic and unpredictable. Because in practice, you could never know the initial conditions with perfect accuracy, and I'm talking infinite decimal places.\n But the result suggests why even today with huge supercomputers, it's so hard to forecast the weather more than a week in advance. In fact, studies have shown that by the eighth day of a long-range forecast, the prediction is less accurate than if you just\n took the historical average conditions for that day. And knowing about chaos, meteorologists no longer make just a single forecast. Instead they make ensemble forecasts, varying initial conditions and model parameters to create a set\n of predictions. Now far from being the exception to the rule, chaotic systems have been turning up everywhere. The double pendulum, just two simple pendulums connected together, is chaotic. Here, two double pendulums have been released simultaneously with\n almost the same initial conditions. But no matter how hard you try, you could never release a double pendulum and make it behave the same way twice. Its motion will forever be unpredictable. You might think that\n Chaos always requires a lot of energy or irregular motions, but this system of five fidget spinners with repelling magnets in each of their arms is chaotic too. At first glance the system seems to repeat regularly, but if you watch more closely\n closely, you'll notice some strange motions. A spinner suddenly flips the other way. Even our solar system is not predictable. A study simulating our solar system for a hundred million years into the future found its behavior as a whole to\n be chaotic, with a characteristic time of about 4 million years. That means within say 10 or 15 million years, some planets or moons may have collided or been flung out of the solar system entirely. The very system\n we think of as the model of order is unpredictable on even modest time scales. So how well can we predict the future? Not very well at all, at least when it comes to chaotic systems. The further into the future you try to predict, the harder\n becomes and past a certain point predictions are no better than guesses. The same is true when looking into the past of chaotic systems and trying to identify initial causes. I think of it kind of like a fog that sets in the further we try to look\n into the future or into the past. Chaos puts fundamental limits on what we can know about the future of systems and what we can say about their past. But there is a silver lining. Let's look again at the phase space of Lorenz's equations.\n If we start with a whole bunch of different initial conditions and watch them evolve, initially the motion is messy. But soon all the points have moved towards or onto an object. The object coincidentally looks a bit like a butterfly. It is the attraction.\n For a large range of initial conditions, the system evolves into a state on this attractor. Now remember, all the paths traced out here never cross and they never connect to form a loop. If they did, then they would continue on that loop forever and the behavior would\n be periodic and predictable. So each path here is actually an infinite curve in a finite space. But how is that possible? Fractals. But that's a story for another video. This particular attractor is called the Lorenz attractor, probably\n the most famous example of a chaotic attractor, though many others have been found for other systems of equations. If people have heard anything about the butterfly effect, it's usually about how tiny causes make the future unpredictable. But the science behind the butterfly effect also\n reveals a deep and beautiful structure underlying the dynamics, one that can provide useful insights into the behavior of a system. So you can't predict how any individual state will evolve, but you can say how a collection of states evolve.\n And, at least in the case of Lorenz's equations, they take the shape\n cross-device sync.

            "transcription": "I want to thank the sponsor of this episode, LastPass, which remembers your passwords so you don't have to. More about them at the end of the show. What you are looking at is known as the Janabekov Effect, or the tennis racket theorem.\n or the intermediate axis theorem. But we'll get to that. Now you may have seen clips like this one before, but in this video I will provide the best intuitive explanation of how this effect works. Or at least, that's my goal.\n Now it involves arguably the best mathematician alive, Soviet-era secrets, and the end of the world. So in 1985, cosmonaut Vladimir Jennebekov was tasked with saving the Soviet space station Salyut 7.\n which had completely shut down. The mission was so dramatic that the Russians made a movie out of it in 2017 and after rescuing the space station, Janabekov unpacked supplies sent up from Earth which were locked down with a wing\n And as the wing nut spun off the bolt, he noticed something strange. The wing nut maintained its orientation for a short time and then it flipped 180 degrees and as he kept watching it flipped back a few\n seconds later, and it continued flipping back and forth at regular intervals. This motion wasn't caused by forces or torques applied to the wingnut, there were none, and yet it kept flipping. It was a strange and counterintuitive\n phenomenon, one that the Russians kept secret for 10 years. Why the secrecy? Well, that is what we're going to find out. Six years later, in 1991, a paper was published in the Journal of Dynamics and Differential\n called the twisting tennis racket and although it was related it of course makes no mention of the secret Janabekov effect. The paper says if you hold a tennis racket facing you and then flip it in the air like this it not only rotates the way you would\n intend it to it also makes a half turn around an axis that passes through its handle so the side that was originally facing you will be facing away when you catch it. Now to understand this we need to go through some basics like there are three ways to spin a tennis racket\n about its three principal axes. The first is about an axis that runs through the handle like this. The second is the way we were spinning it before with an axis that runs parallel to the head of the racket. And the third is about an axis that\n that runs perpendicular to the head of the racket. Now it's easier to spin the racket around some of these axes than others. That is, you get more angular velocity for a given amount of torque. It's easiest to spin the racket around this first axis\n gets going really fast and that is because the mass is distributed closer to this axis than to any of the others. We say its moment of inertia is the smallest when spinning in this orientation. Spinning about the\n third axis has the greatest moment of inertia and so the racket gets spinning pretty slowly and that's because this mass is distributed as far from this axis as possible so this is the maximum moment of inertia axis.\n Now what you'll notice with spins about these axes is that they're stable. There's no rotation happening about any of the other axes when you try to rotate around the first or third axes. But rotating about the second axis, the intermediate axis,\n where the moment of inertia is in between the other two, well that is where you get this half twist. And there's virtually nothing you can do to stop it. And it's not just tennis rackets of course, I've done this before\n with cell phones and with a disc with a hole in it. I took this disc on an ice rink and in a zero G plane. I have been obsessed with the intermediate axis theorem and what you need to make the intermediate axis effect work is\n is an object that has three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes. And well, that's not every object. This object, for example, a spinning ring, has only two different moments of inertia for rotations like that and then rotation\n like this. Spinning things is not a specialty. Wow. I feel like it should be rotations like that. That's that's the one I was looking for. Anything with spherical symmetry has only one moment of inertia. So these objects\n will not demonstrate the tennis racket theorem. For that you need what's called an asymmetric top, something with three different moments of inertia in its three different principal axes. Now the tennis racket paper claims the twisting phenomenon seems\n seems to be new. It is not mentioned in general texts on classical mechanics, amongst other sources that they've checked, but it is actually. It's even in the textbook they cited, Landau and Lifshitz. In fact, an understanding of the\n intermediate axi-theorem goes back at least another 150 years to a book called the new theory of rotating bodies by Louis Poinso. So this is old physics but in space the\n phenomenon looks like something new. In microgravity, the effects are just so much more striking than a half twist of a tennis racket. And at random intervals on social media, these videos crop up to frenzied questions of, is this\n real? And what's going on? How does this work? Well, a number of simulations and animations have been made, but if you really want to understand what's happening, most people resort to the math, including me.\n in the past. Well the mathematics is kind of complicated and boy is there a lot of math. There's this story of a student who asked famous physicist Richard Feynman if there was any intuitive way of understanding the intermediate axis theorem and as\n As the story goes, he thought about it carefully and deeply for 10 or 15 seconds and then said, no. Well, the goal of this video is to prove Feynman wrong, to provide an intuitive explanation\n of the intermediate axis theorem. But the explanation is not mine. It actually comes from one of the greatest living mathematicians, Terry Tao. He has won the Fields Medal amongst a host of other awards and for this video I actually asked him\n for an interview, but he declined because he's busy solving centuries-old math problems. So, you know, fair enough. But that's okay, because we have the explanation he posted to Math Overflow in 2011, and it goes like this.\n we have a thin rigid massless disc centered in our coordinate system. Now add some heavy point masses to opposite edges of the disc on the x-axis. Even though they're point masses, I'll put some large cubes around them\n to remind us of their significant mass. Then add some light point masses on opposite edges of the disc on the y-axis. Now this disc has three different moments of inertia about its three principal axes. Rotating around the x-axis has the\n smallest moment of inertia since only the light masses are moving, rotating about the z-axis has the greatest moment of inertia since all four masses are going around, and rotating about the y-axis has the intermediate moment of inertia. Rotating like this, the only\n forces in the disk are centripetal forces which accelerate the big masses towards the center. This keeps them turning in uniform circular motion. Now what if we change reference frames so now we're rotating with the disk? Well then we see centrifugal\n Normally I don't like talking about centrifugal forces because if you analyze things in inertial frames of reference you never have to deal with them, but if you're in a rotating frame of reference then centrifugal forces do appear in the analysis put\n pushing any masses away from the rotation axis and those forces are proportional to their distance from the axis, in this case the y-axis. So here there is no centrifugal force on the small masses because they're located right on the y-axis\n So the only centrifugal force acts on the big masses outwards, and that's balanced by the centripetal forces pushing inwards. Now this is all fine and good, but what if the disk is bumped so that it's no longer rotating perfectly about the y-axis?\n now the small masses will experience some centrifugal force proportional to their distance from the y-axis. Tension forces within the disk ensure that the small masses remain orthogonal to the big masses, and since the big masses are still spinning in roughly the same positions as\n were before with lots of inertia, they constrain the small masses to lie more or less in the yz plane. The little centrifugal forces on these small masses start accelerating them and those forces get bigger as the masses\n move further and further from the y-axis and they keep accelerating until they flip onto opposite sides. Now for the first half of this flip the centrifugal forces are accelerating the small masses but in the second half the\n centrifugal forces slow the masses down, reversing all the previous acceleration, so that they basically come to rest when they reach the opposite side. The pattern then repeats indefinitely, with the disc flipping back and forth\n at regular intervals. And there you have it, an intuitive explanation for the intermediate axis theorem, or tenis racket theorem, or Janabekov effect, or whatever you want to call it. So if this is well established,\n Why did the Soviets make it classified for 10 years? Well possibly because of what Genebekov did after observing the strange behavior of the wingnut. He attached a ball of modeling clay or plasticine to it and tried spinning that.\n And sure enough, he found that just like the wingnut, this ball flipped over periodically. And the implication was that maybe since the Earth is a spinning ball in space, it too could flip over. I mean, we know the Earth's magnetic\n polls have reversed in the past so could this be related? In 2012, with the Mayan prophecies of the end of the world, speculation about the Genebekov effect proved irresistible for some conspiracy theorists and people in the media. Plus on May\n On the 13th 2012, the official site of the Russian Federal Space Agency, Roscosmos, posted an article in honor of Janabekov's 70th birthday. And in it they said,\n So how do we assess the validity of this hypothesis?\n I mean, is the Earth actually going to flip over? Well, we can get some clues from simple experiments performed by astronaut Don Pettit aboard the space station. He shows that a book will spin stably about its first\n or third axis just as we'd expect and a solid cylinder will also spin stably around its first or third axis. But a liquid filled cylinder spinning about the first axis that's the one with the smallest moment of inertia it's\n unstable and it'll end up rotating about its axis with the largest moment of inertia. Why is this? For an isolated object spinning in space you'd probably think both its angular momentum and its kinetic energy would be\n constant. But that's only half true. Angular momentum stays constant, but kinetic energy can be converted into other forms of energy, like heat. So in this case, as the liquid sloshing around inside, the energy can be dissipated.\n and spinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia also means spinning with the greatest kinetic energy and as this kinetic energy is dissipated the cylinder has no other option but to spin about the axis that achieves the minimum kinetic energy and that is the\n one with the largest moment of inertia, so when it's rotating end over end. For a given amount of angular momentum then, rotating with the maximum moment of inertia is the lowest energy state. So that is the state that all bodies will tend towards if they\n have any way of dissipating their energy. The US learned this the hard way with their first satellite, the Explorer 1. It was designed to spin about its long axis and be spin stabilized, but within hours of achieving orbit it was\n rotating end over end. But what happened? I mean it seems like a rigid cylinder. Well the problem was these flexible antennas. They allowed the satellite to dissipate energy as they swung back and forth, gradually reducing the\n energy of the satellite until it had to rotate about the axis that maximized its moment of inertia. Now the earth is just like this. It has ways of dissipating energy internally so over time it has come to spin about the axis with\n moment of inertia and most astronomical objects do the same Mars for example has a mass concentration or major positive gravity anomaly called the Tharsis rise and it is located not coincidentally\n at the equator because that puts it as far as possible from the axis of rotation and ensures that Mars is rotating with the maximum moment of inertia. Most asteroids far from rotating about random axes, they spin almost all of them around the axis\n with the maximum moment of inertia. So the earth won't flip, it's spinning about the axis with the maximum moment of inertia and that is stable. Hey this part of the video is\n is sponsored by LastPass.

            "transcription": "This video was sponsored by Caseta by Lutron. Imagine you have a giant circuit consisting of a battery, a switch, a light bulb, and two wires which are each 300,000 kilometers long. That is the distance\n light travels in one second. So they would reach out halfway to the moon and then come back to be connected to the light bulb, which is one meter away. Now the question is, after I close this switch, how long would it take for the bulb to light up?\n Is it half a second, one second, two seconds, one over C seconds, or none of the above? Now you have to make some simplifying assumptions about this circuit, like the wires have to have no resistance, otherwise this wouldn't work, and the light\n has to turn on immediately when current passes through it. But I want you to commit to an answer and put it down in the comments so you can't say, oh yeah I knew that was the answer when I tell you the answer later on. This question\n actually relates to how electrical energy gets from a power plant to your home. You know, unlike a battery, the electricity in the grid comes in the form of alternating current or AC, which means electrons in the power lines are just wiggling back and\n forth. They never actually go anywhere. So if the charges don't come from the power plant to your home, how does the electrical energy actually reach you? When I used to teach this subject, I would say that\n power lines are like this flexible plastic tubing and the electrons inside are like this chain. So what a power station does is it pushes and pulls the electrons back and forth 60 times a second.\n Now at your house you can plug in a device like a toaster which essentially means allowing the electrons to run through it. So when the power station pushes and pulls the electrons, well they encounter resistance in the toaster element and they\n dissipate their energy as heat and so you can toast your bread. Now this is a great story I think it's easy to visualize and I think my students understood it. The only problem is it's wrong. For one thing there is\n There is no continuous conducting wire that runs all the way from a power station to your house. No, there are physical gaps, there are breaks in the line, like in transformers, where one coil of wire is wrapped on one side, a different coil of wire is wrapped on the other side,\n so electrons cannot possibly flow from one to the other. Plus, I mean if it's the electrons that are carrying the energy from the power station to your device, then when those same electrons flow back to the power station, why are\n they not also carrying energy back from your house to the power station? I mean if the flow of current is two ways then why does energy only flow in one direction? These are the lies you were\n My claim in this video is that\n All of that is false. So how does it actually work? In the 1860s and 70s, there was a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the universe. When Scottish physicist James\n Maxwell realized that light is made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other and they are in phase, meaning when one is at its maximum so is the other wave.\n Now he works out the equations that govern the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and hence these waves. Those are now called Maxwell's equations. But in 1883, one of Maxwell's former students, John Henry Pointing,\n is thinking about conservation of energy. Now if energy is conserved locally in every tiny bit of space, well then you should be able to trace the path that energy flows from one place to another. So think about the energy that comes to\n us from the sun. I mean during those eight minutes when the light is traveling the energy is stored and being transmitted in the electric and magnetic fields of the light. Now pointing works out an equation to describe\n energy flux. That is, how much electromagnetic energy is passing through an area per second. This is known as the pointing vector and it's given the symbol S. And the formula is really pretty simple. It's just a constant\n Now the cross product is just a particular way of multiplying two vectors together, where you\n multiply their perpendicular magnitudes and to find the direction you put your fingers in the direction of the first vector which in this case is the electric field and curl them in the direction of the second vector the magnetic field then your thumb points in the direction of the resultant\n vector, the energy flux. So what this shows us about light is that the energy is flowing perpendicular to both the electric and the magnetic fields, and it's in the same direction as the light is traveling. So this makes a lot of sense.\n sense. Light carries energy from its source out to its destination. But the kicker is this. Pointhing's equation doesn't just work for light. It works any time\n there are electric and magnetic fields coinciding. Anytime you have electric and magnetic fields together there is a flow of energy and you can calculate it using Poynting's vector. To illustrate this\n Let's consider a simple circuit with a battery and a light bulb. The battery by itself has an electric field, but since no charges are moving, there is no magnetic field, so the battery doesn't lose energy. When the battery is connected,\n When it's connected into the circuit, its electric field extends through the circuit at the speed of light. This electric field pushes electrons around, so they accumulate on some of the surfaces of the conductors, making them negatively charged, and are depleted\n elsewhere, leaving their surfaces positively charged. These surface charges create a small electric field inside the wires, causing electrons to drift preferentially in one direction. Note that this drift velocity\n The current velocity is extremely slow, around a tenth of a millimeter per second. But this is current. Well, conventional current is defined to flow opposite the motion of electrons, but this is what's making it happen.\n the surfaces of the conductors also creates an electric field outside the wires, and the current inside the wires creates a magnetic field outside the wires. So now there is a combination of electric and magnetic fields\n in the space around this circuit. So according to Poynting's theory, energy should be flowing. And we can work out the direction of this energy flow using the right hand rule. Around the battery, for example, the electric field is down and the\n The magnetic field is into the screen, so you find the energy flux is to the right, away from the battery. In fact, all around the battery you'll find the energy is radially outwards. Energy is going out\n out, through the sides of the battery into the fields. Along the wires, again you can use the right hand rule to find the energy is flowing to the right. This is true for the fields along the top wire and the bottom wire.\n But at the filament, the pointing vector is directed in toward the light bulb. So the light bulb is getting energy from the field. If you do the cross product, you find the energy is coming in from all around the bulb. It takes many paths\n from the battery to the bulb, but in all cases the energy is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields. People seem to think that you're pumping electrons and that you're like buying electrons or something which is just so wrong. For most people, I\n And I think to this day, it's quite counterintuitive to think that the energy is flowing through the space around the conductor. But the energy, which is traveling through the field, yeah, is going quite fast. So there are a few things to notice here.\n Even though the electrons go two ways, away from the battery and towards it, by using the pointing vector, you find that the energy flux only goes one way, from the battery to the bulb. This also shows it's the fields and not the electrons that kill\n the energy. Now, what happens if in place of a battery, we use an alternating current source? Well then, the direction of current\n The current reverses every half cycle. But this means that both the electric and magnetic fields flip at the same time. So at any instant, the pointing vector still points in the same direction, from the source to the bulb.\n exact same analysis we used for DC still works for AC. And this explains how energy is able to flow from power plants to homes in power lines. Inside the wires, electrons just oscillate back and forth. Their motion is\n greatly exaggerated here, but they do not carry the energy. Outside the wires, oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel from the power station to your home. You can use the pointing vector to check that the energy flux is going\n in one direction. You might think this is just an academic discussion, that you could see the energy as transmitted either by fields or by the current in the wire, but that is not the case. And people learn this the hard\n when they started laying undersea telegraph cables. The first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858. It only worked for about a month, it never worked properly. There are all kinds of distortions when they tried to send. Enormous amounts of distortion.\n What they found was, sending signals over such a long distance under the sea, the pulses became distorted and lengthened. It was hard to differentiate dots from dashes. To account for the failure,\n failure, there was a debate among scientists. William Thompson, the future Lord Kelvin, thought electrical signals moved through submarine cables like water flowing through a rubber tube, but others, like Heveside and Fitzgerald, argued it was the field\n around the wires that carried the energy and information. And ultimately, this view proved correct. To insulate and protect the submarine cable, the central copper conductor had been coated in an insulator and then encased in\n an iron sheath. The iron was only meant to strengthen the cable, but as a good conductor, it interfered with the propagation of electromagnetic fields, because it increased the capacitance of the line. This is why today, most power lines are suspended\n Even the damp earth acts as a conductor, so you want a large insulating gap of air to separate the wires from the ground. So what is the answer to our giant circuit light bulb question?\n Well after I close the switch the light bulb will turn on almost instantaneously in roughly 1 over C seconds so the correct answer is D. I think a lot of people imagine that the electric field needs\n to travel from the battery all the way down the wire which is a light second long so it should take a second for the bulb to light up but what we've learned in this video is it's not really what's happening in the wires that matters it's what happens around the\n wires and the electric and magnetic fields can propagate out through space to this light bulb which is only one meter away in a few nanoseconds and so that is the limiting factor for the light bulb turning on. Now the bulb\n won't receive the entire voltage of the battery immediately it'll be some fraction which depends on the impedance of these lines and the impedance of the bulb. Now I asked several experts about this question and got kind of different answers but we all agree\n agreed on these main points. So I'm going to put their analysis in the description in case you want to learn more about this particular setup.\n I think it's just kind of wild that this is one of those things that we use\n every day that almost nobody thinks about or knows the right answer to. These travelling electromagnetic waves around power lines are really what's delivering your power.\n Hey, now that you understand how electrical energy actually flows, you can think about that every time you flick on a light switch. And if you want to take your switches to the next level, the sponsor of this video, Caseta by Lutron, provides premium smart lighting control, including switches\n switches, remotes, and plug-in smart dimmers. And since one switch can control many regular bulbs, you can effectively make all those bulbs smart just by replacing the switch. Then you can turn your lights on and off using your phone. Or you can use another device\n like Alexa or Google Assistant. Caseta works with more leading smart home brands than any other smart lighting control system. One of the things I like is setting timers. The lights in my office, for example, turn on by themselves every evening. And this feature gives you peace of mind that\n everyone in your household will always come home to a well-lit house. And once you're already in bed, you can check which lights you forgot to turn off and do that from your phone. Installation is easy. Make sure you turn off power to the switch first, and then disconnect the existing wires\n and connect Caseta's smart switch. If you need any help, they're just a click or a call away.

So what he's going to do is as I'm biking he's going to pick whether I can turn either to the left or to the right. So go for it. I'm giving it a left turn, it pulls the pin out,\n But you can see that you can still fully steer after I've pulled the pin out. I've armed it. There's where it locks. Okay. Now that's when your LED comes on. That just says turn that way. Turn left. Yeah. And if I try to turn right. Can't. I can't.\n And if I try to turn left, you can. I can. So the question is, can I successfully execute this left-hand turn? Should we give it a shot? I mean, he's not going to tell me whether it's left or right, so I have to look at the LED to know which way I can still turn. You let me know when you're ready.\n Okay. No! That was meant to be a turn to the right, but there was no chance in hell. Left! Right!\n If you look closely, you can see the problem. Here I'm trying to turn right, but steering that\n That way puts me off balance. If you could ride this bicycle, you would find it's impossible to turn left without first steering right, and it's impossible to turn right without first steering left. This seems wrong.\n I think most people believe you turn a bike simply by pointing the handlebars in the direction you want to go. After all, this is how you drive a car. Point the front wheels any direction you like, and the car just goes that way. But the difference with a bicycle\n is steering doesn't just affect the direction you're headed, it also affects your balance. Imagine you want to make a right turn, so you steer the handlebars to the right. What you've done is effectively steered the bike out\n from under you, so now you're leaning to the left. And the ground puts a force on the bike to the left, so the only way not to fall is to steer the bike to the left. You have made a left turn. If you really wanted to turn right, you've\n first have to counter steer to the left, so you can lean right into the turn. This is something anyone who rides a bike knows intuitively, but not explicitly. Film someone riding a bike towards you and tell them which\n direction to turn, and you will find they counter steer without even thinking about it.\n stick on your hand. If I'm balancing it and I just start walking toward you it will always fall away from you. If I want to walk toward you it's easy enough to do and people inherently know how to do it. If I pull it backward I can now start walking that way. I have to initially\n If you want to move the pendulum somewhere, you first move the base in the opposite direction. And now the pendulum is leaning in the direction you want to go, so you can move with it. And it's the\n same with a unicycle. In order to go forward, first you have to pedal back. So you're leaning forward and then you can go forward with it. Everything you're doing on a unicycle is all about keeping that contact patch right where it needs\n to be relative to you. You're balancing the broomstick. It's just that on a unicycle you do the longitudinal balance with the pedals and you do the lateral balance the side to side the same as you do with a bike. You essentially sort of a small counter steer to get that weight to get the\n Now, I should point out that sometimes when the steering locked, we just happen to be leaning in the right direction to execute the turn.\n Essentially by sheer luck we had countersteered before that side of the handlebars locked out.\n well right it's just you can't turn left the funny thing is that you couldn't initiate the turn right I mean the wild takeaway is that steering is not just for turning the bike steering is for balancing that's exactly right\n Why is it hard to balance on a stationary bike? I think most people believe it's because the wheels aren't spinning, so there's no gyroscopic effect. But that's not it. The truth is, you use steering to keep the bike underneath you.\n steering doesn't work when you're stationary. Your balance comes not so much from how you position your body over the bike, but by how you steer the bike to keep it underneath you. Even when going straight, you're constantly making small steering adjustments to maintain\n balance. And so if the rider is responsible for steering the bike to keep it balanced, how do bikes without riders stay upright?\n As long as a bike is moving with sufficient speed, it can keep coasting indefinitely. I first became aware of this phenomenon through the great videos by MinutePhysics, which inspired me to make this video. You should definitely check them out. But it turned out the ground\n where we went to test this effect was really bumpy, but the bike still manages to absorb all these perturbations and remains stable. So how does it do this? I think most people believe it's the wheels spinning that creates some sort of gyroscope\n gyroscopic effect that resists falling over. Just like in this demonstration of gyroscopic precession, the wheel stays upright even though gravity is pulling it down. But this is not why bikes are stable. Just watch what happens when we lock the handle\n bars completely so you can only go straight ahead. Some people tried going\n going really fast. Others experimented with extreme balancing techniques.\n But even with the gyroscopic effect of the wheels, no one was able to keep the bike upright for more than a few seconds. This is not safe for a second. It is just as hard to balance\n a bike with locked steering as it is to balance on a stationary bike. No, this one is impossible. Because you can't steer the bike back under you. The real reason bicycles are stable without riders is because they're cleverly designed to steer themselves.\n themselves. If they start falling to one side, the handlebars turn in that direction to steer the wheels back underneath them. At least three mechanisms are responsible for a bike's corrective steering. The first is that due to the angle of the\n front fork, the steering axis intersects the ground in front of where the wheel touches the ground. So if the bike starts leaning to the left, the force from the ground on the tire turns the wheel to the left. If the bike starts leaning right, the\n The force from the ground pushes the wheel to the right. The front wheel of a bicycle is essentially a caster wheel, like those you find on strollers or shopping carts. Whichever way you drive them, the wheel falls in line and rolls in the same direction.\n The second reason for a bike's corrective steering is that the center of mass of the handlebars and front wheel are located slightly in front of the steering axis. So when the bike leans left, their weight pushes the front wheel to the left. If the bike leans right, their weight steers\n And the third mechanism is a gyroscopic effect, but it doesn't keep the bike upright directly, it just helps steer. If you have a gyroscope and you push down on the left hand side, the gyro will turn left.\n If you push down on the right side, it will turn right. This is known as gyroscopic precession. It seems as though the force you apply takes effect 90 degrees from where you applied it. So bikes are stable primarily\n because of steering. They have built-in mechanisms for steering themselves. In fact, you don't need all three mechanisms to create a stable bike. Researchers created this weird looking bicycle to prove a point. It has no gyroscopic\n Thanks to counter-rotating wheels above the wheels that touch the floor. Plus, there is no caster effect because the front wheel touches the floor in front of the steering axis. But this bike is made stable by its mass distribution.\n the force of gravity on which steers it in the direction of any lean. Understanding how bicycles work is still an active area of research. There is a program you can use to input all the different bicycle parameters and see the range of speed\n speeds over which it is self-stable. And this research is leading to better bikes. This prototype has a smart motor in the handlebars to actively help steer, keeping the bike upright even at low speeds.

So it's slippery.\n careful. Alright, are you ready? I'm about to touch a 1 kilogram sphere of silicon 28 atoms. They're about 2.15 times 10\n Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful of people\n ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth 1 million euros, but now that it has been so precisely sculpted, how much is that worth? It's priceless. This you are looking at now is the\n roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure that it's the roundest object? I mean the earth is pretty round isn't it? If this was the earth, if this were the earth then the highest mountain in the lowest valley would be about 14 meters above.\n That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest 1 million euros and thousands of man hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere?\n Well the answer is grave. Or rather, grave, as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see, the grave was the original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the System Internationale\n In 1793, a commission which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice.\n essentially just a liter of ice water. The name Grav came from the Latin gravitas, meaning weight, but it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar to the aristocratic title graph, which is the equivalent of an earl or a count.\n And with the French Revolution in full swing, with the rallying cry of equality for all, you couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this, Lavoisier lost his head. Literally. Not because he helped devise one of the greatest\n greatest systems of measurement of all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new Republican government believed a grav would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway, and so they settled on a gram, which was just\n a thousandth of a grav. But soon they realized that a gram was too small and so they returned to the grav. But since they couldn't call it that, they invented the kilogram, a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SIU\n In 1799, the kilogram definition was refined to be the mass of a liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which it is densest. But water itself is the most dense of all.\n is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard. So a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition and it was declared kilogram of the archives. Now it's important to note at this\n point the kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water. The kilogram of the archives is by definition the kilogram. 90 years later in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded to a platinum iridium\n alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was otherwise basically identical. And to this day it remains the definition of the kilogram. It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram. There was\n It's affectionately known as Le Grand C or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big. It is the only thing in the entire universe with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it is the kilogram.\n It is also the only SI unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars next to six sister kilograms in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled keys in the\n basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts of Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault and tamper with Big K, you would actually be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition on which many of our measurements were\n rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos. Well, no, not actually. But how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well, when it was first created, 40 identical replicas\n were also made. Well they weren't quite identical. They had a mass which was slightly different to Big K, but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilogram\n were reunited for a weigh-in. And this is when the problem started. Because even though all the cylinders were made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged over time. The\n The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with it. And to make matters worse, when they were brought together again 40 years later, their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms. That's about the weight of a\n But fingerprints were not the culprits, since the kilograms were carefully washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually changed the mass of the cylinders. But how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.\n One thing is for certain, the mass of a platinum iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value. And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass.\n of the seven base SI units, four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram. Not to mention all the derived units like Newtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point, those of you in countries that have not adopted the metric system, yes I'm speaking\n to you, Liberia, Burma, and the US, you may be feeling rather smug that your base unit of mass, the avoir du poids pound, is no longer defined by a physical object. No, instead, it is defined as precisely zero\n 0.45359237 kilograms sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate the kilograms dependence on a physical object and this is where the\n silicon sphere comes in. But how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful but you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that. We're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular object\n is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there can you? You can't count how many are in there but you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon there's no voids or\n locations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon. That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only one isotope of silicon, silicon 28, and that explains why the original material was so expensive. And why a sphere?\n Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere, you can characterize the entire dimension of the object. Well, that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created. But how do you\n How do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere, so it was about 2mm larger in diameter. And then we just grind it progressively finer and finer using a\n But making the sphere is only half the battle. Then you need to accurately measure its diameter.\n By knowing the diameter, you can determine its volume, and since the atom spacing of silicon is known to\n high precision, you can then calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant. At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the number of atoms in 12\n of carbon-12. But using this approach, the number of silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or damaged, it would have no effect\n on the definition of the kilogram because it will be defined not by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition of the kilogram say a kilogram is the mass of 2.15 times 10 to the 25 silicon\n 28 atoms. Yes. Is it gonna happen? There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's gonna happen. But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's constant and it's done using something called\n called a watt balance. These two approaches are complementary. Each one provides a check on the other. And if they show good agreement and are able to bring their uncertainties down to about 20 micrograms, they may redefine the kilogram as early as\n 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.\n Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the\n mass of a liter of water at its densest temperature, then how well did we do? Well, if you look at a liter of water at nearly 4 degrees Celsius, it has a mass of 999.975 grams.\n So I guess you could look at this two ways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be. But on the other hand, 214 years ago scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct\n within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want to hear more about the walk balance let me know in the comments and I will see what I can do. It does seem to be the front-runner in terms of\n redefining the kilogram. So we will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere. But don't you think that the scientists who originally conceived of silicon as\n an element should receive some of the credit? Well in 1787 that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave."

            "transcription": "This is 10 micrograms. You think that I might be able to see? I think you might be able to. Oh boy. It's an arrow right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This flashlight will help. I feel like I need to get video of this. I don't know how. It kind of looks\n If you want to measure a force, like the weight of an object, the way it has always been done has been to balance it with some known standards. And the most precise standard weight people\n Ever created was the kilogram, a platinum iridium cylinder stored in a vault on the outskirts of Paris. Replicas of this kilogram were sent to countries around the world to use as their mass standards. Here is K20.\n the United States mass standard. And yes, the US is secretly metric. They just apply a conversion factor to get to freedom units. It's just a little translation that we do here, but our country is actually on the metric system. Doesn't that seem crazy?\n Yes, it's stupid. The uncertainty in the mass of a standard kilogram is on the order of tens of micrograms. So that's tens of parts per billion or about 0.0000001%.\n It's pretty good. But there's a problem if you want to weigh something lighter than a kilogram. The uncertainty increases. This little object here is a 50 gram test weight, so it's a reference mass. Can I pick it up?\n make with tweezers yeah you don't mind sure we try to keep the fingerprints off so it's got a little bit of heft you can feel that a little yeah what about this one what's this this this is 10 grams here yeah that's pretty light\n That's pretty light. And paperclip here is about one gram. And so how you might use one of these test masses. So if you're, you know, working in a laboratory or something like that, you could take one of these little weights and put it on here. And you could look at this\n scale and say, oh, okay, my scale is reasonably well calibrated here. That last digit might, you know, change a little bit, but you could sort of make some statement about whether or not your scale is accurate. When we're talking about the kilogram, you know, these are obviously much smaller\n than a kilogram, you know, how do we think about getting from that large object down to something that's, you know, this size here. One of the ways to do it is using conventional mass metrology, which is that you take the kilogram and you\n use a process called subdivision, where you compare other smaller masses against the kilogram. You take two 500 gram masses and you make sure that they're equal on your balance, right? Then you put both of those on your balance\n and compare that against a kilogram. Would you go like two 500s and then two 250s and then two 125s? Like you just... Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you could do like one common arrangement is something like we have here. This is a 500 milligram mess. These are\n to 200 milligram masses and that's a 100 milligram mass. So these three sum up to this. So you can compare those two against each other. The smallest we have here is down there.\n that's a milligram. That is a milligram. That is a milligram right there. What are they made out of? These are made out of stainless steel and we have to do things like you see this little lint-free brush here. You know if you have a speck of dust on here or something like that it can be\n can be a problem if it's a big speck of dust. So every time we do wangs with these, we'll take a lint-free cloth and a brush and clean them off a little bit. Why are they this sort of curious wire kind of shape?\n It helps you remember which one is which. The five-sided one is 500 milligrams. One of the interesting things from my perspective about this is that you can really subdivide over a large\n range of these masses from a kilogram, you know, this is one millionth of a kilogram is a is a is a milligram. So you can subdivide the kilogram by a million times, you know, but you sort of pay a price for that because each time you do this subdivision, the uncertainty\n So what is the uncertainty in say the milligram there? If you do it with a subdivision, it will be maybe a part in 10 to the 4, one part in 10 to the 4. So like 0.01% of the total.\n But there is a way to do better. And that's thanks to the fact the kilogram is no longer defined by the platinum iridium cylinder in Paris. Over the course of a century or so, the replicate kilograms were brought back to Paris\n few times to be weighed with each other. And from those measurements, it became clear that their weights were diverging by up to 75 micrograms. No one could say if the replicas were getting heavier, or if the original was getting lighter.\n But it was unacceptable to have mass standards with changing masses. So the solution was to eliminate the kilograms dependence on a physical object and instead define it based on a constant of nature, Planck's constant.\n So how does that work? Well, Planck's constant is best known for relating the frequency of a photon to its energy, by E equals hf. But energy and mass are related through E equals mc squared. So you can see how mass is\n In 2019, scientists officially set the value of Planck's constant to be this number in joule seconds, which along with the definition of the meter and the second, now defines what a kilogram is.\n The real advantage of this definition is how it can be applied in fancy scales. This is a kibble balance. It can balance the weight of an object with an electromagnetic force. What's great about that is that the electrical quantities\n used in this balance can be read out very accurately and in units of Planck's constant. So you get direct traceability by weighing something in this balance. This is kind of the smaller cousin\n of the kibble balance. It's called the electrostatic force balance or the EFB. And this is a balance that was designed specifically to measure mass sort of in the milligram range. The kibble balance uses an electromath\n magnet I use a capacitor which is basically two metal electrodes that you apply a potential to and when you apply a potential there's an attractive force between those two electrodes. I apply an electrostatic force by applying a voltage\n here at this. You can see this cylinder here. There's this cylinder and there's inside of this there's another cylinder and they're close together. So you have this concentric cylinder like this. And when you apply a voltage it pulls that moving cylinder down.\n in there and by measuring the properties of the capacitor and measuring the voltage that we apply we can know exactly how much force we get here and then up here we drop our mass on so we compare our gravitational force\n To get the best accuracy, this lab is located deep underground, and they keep the air temperature a constant 20 degrees Celsius to avoid any thermal expansion or\n or contraction of the devices. And all measurements in this balance are made in a vacuum, so there are no air currents and no buoyant force on the object from the atmosphere. They've even carefully measured the acceleration due to gravity in the lab.\n There it is, it's under the chair. Right there, that triangle. That is where the USGS measured absolute gravity with an absolute gravimeter, 9.801 ish meters per second.\n At the milligram level, so 10 micro Newtons-ish of course, yes, this measures force the most accurately in the world. I'm confident in saying that. But of course, you know, you can go low\n than that. This is the smallest weight and you can't see it here. This is 10 micrograms. So when you think about the uncertainty in a kilogram, when you take Planck's constant at a kibble balance and you realize the kilogram, you're at that level of about\n 10 micrograms and that is what 10 micrograms I mean you can't I had to put the little arrow here so you can if you were here in the laboratory you could look and peer down there maybe I feel like I need to to get video of this so\n people can see what 10 micrograms. You know, I don't know how. It kind of looks like a hair, like a tiny, like a smaller than an eyelash, right? Much thinner. Yeah, that's about the scale you're looking at there. Yeah.\n I'm almost certain I can capture this on video. We brought a special lens with us. We brought a special lens. 24 mil macro, because I was like, we're gonna need it for this. Try to find this thing.\n Oh, I can see it. Oh, yes. Do you see it there? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it. You made this. Yes, with great trouble and then calibrated it on a balance. It was man, I'll tell you, it was not\n easy. When you have that thing, you can imagine what it's like trying to work with something like this, right? And this is about as small as you can reasonably expect to make something as a test weight. And if you want to measure a force smaller than\n that. So I have these little tiny chips here. These are atomic force microscope cantilevers. There are little tiny force sensors on the end of these. They're little tiny cantilever beams with a sharp tip. And you can use that sharp tip to\n press against things and apply nano Newton to piconewton forces. But I mean the tip is so small though it's very very difficult to see it really requires a microscope. Is it like there's a little diving board? Yeah exactly there's a little diving board that's right it looks\n like a little diving board. It's like a spring, right? And if you push on it, the more it bends, the larger the force. What is the smallest force that you want to measure? Yeah, I can show you. I can show you. This is one of the sensors we used to do the\n molest forces that I can confidently say we've measured that are traceable in some way to the international system of units. And that is femtonutens of force at about a piconewton would be like if you're stretching out a DNA molecule.\n So if you take a DNA molecule and stretch it out end to end, that's a piconewton. So a factor of a thousand less than that was what we were measuring. So, you know, this is an example of one of the sensors we use to get to the sort of femtonewton level.\n This is a fused silica parallelogram flexure. You can't see it really well. So let me, I have a big, big version right here. So what we can do is we can set this vibrating and it'll vibrate with a really pure tone and we can see very, very\n small changes in force based on how far this vibrates up and down. I would have a little laser interferometer which measures the motion of this. So we measure the displacement of this end here and then right next to it would have a little tiny\n optical fiber that would deliver unknown optical laser power to this. So this would be a photon pressure force, whereby reflecting the light off the surface here, we actually get a very small force. If we vary that force\n sinusoidally, we vary it in time, we can get this to move up and down and we can get it to vibrate. And we can see differences as small as femtonutens in our force. So you're saying you could measure the force from a laser pointer? Yeah.\n Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, we've done that. That's right. That's about about approximately seven piconewtons of force. Once again, you know, that's enough to stretch out a DNA molecule. Can I ask you the big question?\n Yeah, yeah. Why does anyone need to measure forces this small? That's a good question. So a couple of things, you know, there are a couple of different answers to that. One is sort of the industrial relevance. Automotive manufacturers need to measure the\n of particulates that come off their exhaust, particularly in diesel systems. Particulate contamination is really kind of a big deal. So you need to be able to measure 50 micrograms of these particulates for those environmental standards to be\n The laser power measurements for people who are doing industrial processes with lasers because you can actually use the measurement of a small force to calibrate laser power. You know, pharmaceuticals, you know, you have milligram doses, microgram doses sometimes.\n The other thing that's important, I think, kind of goes to the heart of why NIST is so cool, in my opinion, is that it really helps us push the frontiers of science. The scientific, new scientific discoveries benefit from the new measurement capabilities, which then feed\n into new precision metrology capabilities. And so that is really one of the things to me that makes NIST really special is that we're very good at sort of creating that environment where that can happen.\n If you, like me, are fascinated by precision measurement, then I bet you would love the sponsor of this video, Brilliant.

            "transcription": "Everyone knows if you shake up a carbonated drink, it explodes. But why is this? Well, here I have an identical bottle with a pressure gauge.\n gauge fitted to it. And I want you to make a prediction right here. If I shake up this bottle, will the pressure increase, decrease, or remain the same? And while you're thinking about that, let me tell you this video is sponsored by Squarespace, the all-in-one platform\n for building your online presence. More about Squarespace at the end of the show. Okay, I hope you have made your prediction and registered it in the poll up here. This bottle has been sitting stationary for a few days at room temperature. You can see the pressure reading is about three atmospheres.\n 330 kilopascals and I'm going to shake it up and see what happens. Ready? In three, two, one... And the pressure is still the same. You might suspect that, well, maybe\n this bottle is all out of gas maybe it wouldn't explode on me so just to make sure yep it would go so it's not an increase in pressure that causes a bottle to explode\n like that. So why is it? Well you shouldn't feel bad if you predicted that the pressure would increase because in fact that explanation was published in New Scientist in 1986, leading many other scientists to come forward saying that is not the real\n explanation. So we will find out what it is after we explore the second perplexing physics problem. Consider this. If you put identical ice cubes in a cup of fresh water and a cup of salt water,\n Which ice cube will melt first? Again, you can register your prediction by answering the poll here. Now as you're thinking about that, I want to show you the setup. Okay, so here I have regular fresh water. I'm just gonna fill up each cup.\n Then I'm going to add about a tablespoon of salt into this cup on the right. Now if you know a bit about chemistry you may recognize that adding sodium chloride to water actually takes energy and so it lowers the temperature\n of\n ice cubes in in three two one and they're off watching ice cubes melt isn't this entertaining YouTube\n It has only been about a minute, but already I can tell that the ice cube in the freshwater is melting faster than the ice cube in the saltwater. How does that make any sense? When we put salt on the roads to melt ice faster,\n So why isn't this ice cube melting as fast as the one in freshwater? Well that is what I'm gonna explain, but first let's go to the third perplexing physics problem. Okay here I have a metal ring and a\n closed loop of chain and I'm gonna do this all in one take so you know that I'm not playing any tricks. So what I'm gonna do is dangle the chain and then hold the ring over it like so and then I'm gonna drop the ring.\n And exactly what you expect happens. The ring just falls off this chain and of course how could anything else possibly happen because well it's a closed loop of chain and a closed ring. But...\n If you think about it really hard, you can get the ring to stick on the chain. Have a look at that. So how does this work? I think we're going to\n to have to go to some slow-mo footage to really see what's going on.\n The first time I saw this, I was surprised.\n Now I'll let you in on the secret. When you want the ring to stick on the chain, the key is to let it go on one side before the other side. So I'm going to let it go with my thumb first and it'll just sort of slide off\n my finger and by doing that the ring will stick on the chain. It introduces just a little bit of rotation so that the ring rotates about 90 degrees and slides down the chain like this.\n this. As it does, these pieces slide up the sides and when you get to the bottom, it's almost like this piece at the bottom gets sucked into the middle of the ring and then at the last minute gets pulled\n And it snaps on and it's locked on like that.\n So that's how you can get a ring locked on to a closed loop of chain.\n So back to problem number two. Why is the ice cube in fresh water melting faster than the one in salt water? Well I think we can get a better view of this if I add a little bit of food coloring right on top of the ice cube.\n Because the water coming off that ice cube is cold, it's more dense than the surrounding fresh water. And so it descends in the glass, and that brings more warm fresh water.\n up to meet the ice cube melting it faster. Whereas on the other hand in the salt water as the ice cube melts that fresh water is actually less\n dense than the salt water around it. And so it stays, that cold water that just melted off the ice cube stays around the ice cube, in effect insulating it from the warmer salt water around it.\n Okay, that seems like a very plausible explanation and maybe a convincing demonstration, but in the edit, me from the future, I decided that, you know, maybe this wasn't the best way to explain this because,\n you're just dropping food coloring in there and maybe food coloring would just float on the surface of saltwater anyway and sink in freshwater so not a good demonstration so a better demonstration I thought might be if we use colored ice cubes\n To begin with. Okay, I know there's a lot of food coloring in there and that makes things kind of hard to see, but I think you can clearly see the currents of cold water streaming down to the bottom of the cup in the freshwater\n and not in the salt water side. So I think this does clearly show what I was saying. The cool water that comes off the ice cube doesn't go down deep into the cup. Over here you can see\n see that's what's happened. So why do shaken carbonated drinks explode? First let's explain why the pressure doesn't increase in the headspace when you shake it up. This is because of equilibrium\n You know, when you pick up a bottle of soda in the grocery store, it's been sitting there for a few days. So the dissolved gas, the dissolved CO2 in the liquid, is at equilibrium with the gas up here in the headspace. And that equilibrium only depends\n on the temperature and the pressure of gas in the headspace. So no amount of shaking is going to change the pressure up here. For most soda bottles these days that pressure is about three atmospheres. Now you can actually hear those three\n atmospheres of pressure get released when I open the bottle. But of course that's not messy because it's just gas coming out the top. There's no liquid. But now the liquid is no longer in equilibrium. I mean it used to\n be under three atmospheres of pressure and now it's just under one atmosphere, ambient pressure. And so because of that there is more dissolved CO2 in this liquid than would be at equilibrium at this pressure. And so the CO2 starts to\n come out of solution and well those are the bubbles that you taste that's why this drink is fizzy. Non-equilibrium beverage. And if you leave it open those bubbles will keep coming out until the whole drink goes flat. Now I'm gonna put the pressure gauge\n on top of this bottle so we can actually see the CO2 coming out of solution and increasing the pressure right here. And if I left this bottle alone for long enough, the pressure would eventually come back to equilibrium.\n But as you can see, it is a very slow process. And that's because it's actually quite hard for dissolved gas like CO2 to spontaneously come out of solution. One way that I can accelerate this process is by using a very small amount of oxygen.\n by introducing nucleation sites into the liquid. One example of a nucleation site is a tiny gas bubble. So if I shake up the bottle, what I'm actually doing is introducing little nucleation sites, tiny air bubbles, into the liquid\n and that makes it easier for the CO2 to come out of solution and so we'll see this pressure increase much more rapidly. You ready? I'm gonna shake it up in three, two, one...\n And there you see the pressure has quite quickly come back to about 3 atmospheres, 320 kPa. So if you shake up a closed carbonated drink that's been at equilibrium, well you are not increasing the pressure\n the bottle, but you are introducing tiny air bubbles into the liquid which act as nucleation sites. Some of them cling to the walls of the bottle, so when you go to open it, those bubbles do two things. First, they expand due to the decrease in pressure\n and that pushes up the liquid above them, and second they act as nucleation sites allowing the dissolved CO2 to come out of solution much more rapidly and so that's what leads to the carbonated drink explosion. But this suggests a way to disarm a\n shaken carbonated beverage and that is by flicking the walls of the bottle. That gets rid of those bubbles that are clinging to the sides and allows you to open the bottle without incident. Ha!\n It worked. Now is there a way to introduce nucleation sites into a carbonated drink without shaking it? Yes. That's exactly what you're doing when you put a Mentos in a carbonated drink. The rough surface of the Mentos acts as a nucleation site\n which allows the CO2 to come out of solution much faster, creating the soda fountain. Me again. So when I showed this video to Diana, the physics girl, she asked whether paper straws have more nucleation sites than plastic ones. And to be honest, I'm not sure\n about the research around this but there are some other YouTube videos showing how drinks overflow when you put a paper straw in and also my little preliminary analysis with this paper straw show that it does indeed create\n more bubbles than a plastic straw. So if you needed another reason to hate paper straws, well there you go. They make your carbonated drink more fizzy as it comes up the straw. This has been three perplexing physics\n problems.

I'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology here in Washington DC and I'm going to the sub-basement.\n dark down here we're gonna find out how they're gonna redefine a kilogram. The kilogram is in trouble. Since 1799 it's been defined as the mass of a metal cylinder in a locked vault in a basement in Paris. But over the last century\n careful measurements of this international prototype kilogram, and in theory identical national standards from around the world have shown that their masses are diverging. The spread has grown to around 50 micrograms, or 50 parts per billion, and having a standard of mass that\n changes is unacceptable. Plus the kilogram is the last of the base SI units to still be defined by a physical object. The meter for example used to be defined as the length of a platinum bar in Paris, but in 1983 it was redefined as the distance light\n travels in 1 over 299792458ths of a second. This definition means that the speed of light is set to exactly 299792458.000000, etc. meters per second.\n Note how this works. First you take the existing definition, say the length of that meter bar, and you measure as carefully as you can how it relates to a physical constant of the universe, the speed of light. Then you set the exact value of that constant\n and use it to redefine how long a meter is. I know this might seem circular, but importantly it moves the point of truth off of the physical object and onto the unchanging constant of the universe. So naturally the thought\n is to do the same thing with the kilogram. But using which constant and how? Well there were a number of different strategies that were attempted but the two that achieved the greatest success were\n We're number one, using a silicon sphere to determine and set Avogadro's number, and number two, to use a Watt balance to determine and set Planck's constant. How you doing, Derek? Pretty good. Nice to meet you. Where is the Watt balance? The Watt balance is behind these closed doors.\n It's in there. It's correct. And right now the problem is that we are in a crunch to get the number by the end of May. What's the number? The Planck's constant. This is what we measure with the Watt Balance. In 2011, the General Conference on Weights and Measures\n decided that the kilogram should be redefined based on Planck's constant, but that doesn't mean that the Avogadro approach was futile. I mean you can use Avogadro's number to calculate Planck's constant and vice versa. So ultimately both approaches are going to be used to redefine Planck's constant and\n and Avogadro's number simultaneously.\n Now, since I've already discussed the Avogadro approach in a previous video, here I want to focus on the watt balance. It's actually now\n called a Kibble balance in honor of its inventor, Brian Kibble, who actually passed away in 2016. You know, traditional balances work by equating the gravitational forces on objects in two pans. The Kibble balance looks kind of similar, but all of the balancing happens\n on the left hand side where a mass pan is attached to a coil of wire in a magnetic field. On the right hand side is a motor. The whole apparatus is sealed and operated in vacuum. The balance operates in two modes, weighing mode and velocity\n and both are required to determine Planck's constant. In weighing mode, a kilogram mass standard is placed on the mass pan and then current is passed through the coil in the magnetic field and adjusted until the weight of the kilogram is equal and opposite to the electromagnetic force on the coil.\n The equation for this is mass times the local gravitational acceleration is equal to the magnetic field times the length of wire in the coil times the current flowing through it. In this equation the variables that are difficult to measure exactly are the magnetic field strength\n and the length of wire in the coil. But luckily the kibble balance allows us to get around this problem using velocity mode. In velocity mode, the kilogram mass is lifted off the mass pan and now the motor on the other side of the balance is used to move the coil back and forth\n at constant velocity through the magnetic field. This motion induces a voltage in the coil which is equal to the magnetic field times the length of wire in the coil times its velocity. Now we have two equations which we can solve for B times L and so we can set them\n equal to each other and eliminate these variables without having to know precisely what their values are. And if we rearrange a little bit you get voltage times current equals mass times gravity times velocity. On the left hand side there is electrical power and on the right hand side mechanical\n And that's why this was called the watt, the unit of power, balance. But how do you go from this to Planck's constant, the number that relates a photon's frequency to its energy? Well it turns out there's actually a way of measuring voltage accuracy.\n using a macroscopic quantum effect that involves Josephson junctions. So a Josephson junction consists of two superconductors separated by a thin piece of insulator. Now if you apply microwave radiation to that junction you\n You create a voltage across the device, and its value is precisely known to be hf over 2e, where h is Planck's constant, f is the frequency of the radiation, and e is the charge on an electron. Now by tuning that frequency and stacking as many\n many of these Josephson junctions as you want in series, you can create virtually any voltage you like very very precisely. The way this is used in the kibble balance is a stack of hundreds of thousands of Josephson junctions are put into the circuit with the coil as it is moved through the\n field and so you exactly balance the voltage which is induced in the coil using those Josephson junctions so you can measure that voltage very very accurately. But how do we measure current? Well it turns out this voltage measuring method is so good that instead of trying\n measure current directly we instead measure V on R which is the same thing so this current is passed through a resistor and we measure that voltage again using Josephson junctions and then to measure resistance we use another macroscopic quantum effect called the quantum Hall effect\n which is beyond the scope of this video but suffice it to say that the resistance measurement will be an integer fraction 1 over p times Planck's constant divided by the charge on the electron squared. So if we sub all of this into our equation\n and solve for H we have that Planck's constant is equal to 4 over PN squared, those are all constant numbers that we know, times the local acceleration due to gravity times velocity divided by frequency squared times the mass which is 1 kilogram. So\n So here we have a very precise equation for Planck's constant in terms of the mass of 1 kilogram. Now to get an answer that's good to say 10 parts per billion, you need to know all of these values very accurately. So to measure V for example,\n of the coil as it moves through the magnetic field, we use a laser interferometer. As the distance to the coil changes, the interference fringes pass over a detector, and essentially by counting how many fringes go past in a certain period of time, you can determine the speed of the coil very\n accurately. To measure G, a device called a gravimeter was used to map out the local acceleration due to gravity in the balance room before it was built in there. The gravimeter actually drops a corner reflector down a vacuum tube and measures its acceleration, again through interferometer\n geometry, counting the fringes as they pass. This is a 3D printed map of the acceleration due to gravity in the kibble balance room. The bump is due to the mass of the powerful and very heavy permanent magnet that's in the balance. The acceleration due to gravity\n continually be measured because it can be affected at this level of precision by the positions of the Sun and Moon and even the water table underneath the building. In 2018 the kilogram will no longer be defined by an object in Paris. Instead it will be defined by\n based on the fixed value of Planck's constant, which is being finalized right now as a result of all these measurements from the kibble balances and silicon spheres. So right now what we do is we put the mass in and we get H out and in 2018\n the redefinition age will be fixed and we use that to realize the yield of mass. Easy. Yeah, just that easy. Just that simple. Simple.

            "transcription": "A portion of this video was sponsored by Norton 360. Classical mechanics is great. If you know the state of a system, say the position and velocity of a particle, then you can use an equation, Newton's second law, to calculate what that particle will do.\n in the future. In quantum mechanics, if you know the quantum state of a particle, that is its wave function, you can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to calculate what that particle will do in the future. Usually it spreads out over time as it is doing here.\n Note, to make this animation, we really solved the Schrodinger equation. So there's a beautiful symmetry here. If you know the initial state, you can use an equation to evolve that state smoothly and continuously into the future.\n The problem is, in quantum mechanics we never actually observe the wave function like this. Instead, when we measure it, we find the particle at a single point in space. So how are we to reconcile the spread-out wave function\n evolving smoothly under the Schrodinger equation with this point-like particle detection. Now I think it's understandable that when the founders of quantum theory approached this problem they considered the measurement more real than the wave function. After\n After all, the measurement was something we had actually observed, and it matches our experience of a world of matter particles. It was harder to say what the wave function was exactly. Schr\u00f6dinger formulated his wave equation because\n notably de Broglie, suspected that matter has wave-like properties. But it took a third physicist, Max Born, to propose how we should interpret the wave function. At each point in space, the wave function has a complex amplitude.\n essentially just a real number plus an imaginary number. Max Born suggested if you take that amplitude and square it you get the probability of finding the particle there. The fact that you have to square the amplitude actually appears as a last-minute footnote in\n in\n Einstein uncomfortable. But the Born Rule, as it is now called, remains at the heart of quantum mechanics because it is spectacularly successful at predicting the outcomes of experiments. So the way quantum mechanics came to be understood, and the way I learned it, is that there\n There are two sets of rules. When you're not looking, the wave function simply evolves according to the Schrodinger equation. But when you are looking, when you make a measurement, the wave function collapses suddenly and irreversibly. And the probability of measuring any particular outcome\n is given by the amplitude of the wave function associated with that outcome squared. Now, Schr\u00f6dinger himself hated this formulation, which is actually why he invented the famous Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment. Put a cat in a box\n with a radioactive atom. Add a radiation detector that triggers the release of poisonous cyanide gas. Now although it was only meant as a thought experiment, Schr\u00f6dinger helpfully notes this device must be secured against direct interference\n by the cat. Anyway, the whole point of the experiment is to magnify the state of the atom up to the state of something macroscopic and tangible. He could have picked anything, it didn't have to be alive, but Schr\u00f6dinger selected a cat. If the atom decays\n the detector detects radiation, releases the poison, and the cat dies. If the atom doesn't decay, the detector doesn't detect radiation, poison is not released, and the cat remains alive. Since the state of the cat and detector apparatus are directly\n tied to the state of the atom, we say they are entangled. Where things get weird is that according to quantum mechanics, the state of the atom does not have to be either decayed or not decayed. Generally, it's in a superposition of both decayed\n and not decayed at the same time, assuming no measurements have been made. This superposition state of the atom gets entangled with the detector and then the cat. So after some time, the wave function of everything inside the box is in\n a superposition of the atom has not decayed, poison not released, cat alive state, and the atom has decayed, poison released, cat dead state. So according to quantum mechanics, the cat really is both alive and\n dead at the same time. Only when we open the box and make a measurement does the wave function collapse and the cat actually becomes either dead or alive. These days Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is often used as a way to show how weird quantum\n mechanics is. But that wasn't Schr\u00f6dinger's point. He wanted to show that quantum mechanics as formulated was wrong. So taking up Schr\u00f6dinger's argument in this video, I want to show that there is a better way to think about Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. In fact,\n a better way to think about quantum mechanics entirely that I'd argue is more logical and consistent. To get there we have to examine the three essential components of Schrodinger's cat. Superposition, entanglement, and measurement to see if\n Any of them is flawed. Superposition is the idea that quantum objects can be in two different states at the same time. This seems like a crazy idea and something we'd never observe, but we do indirectly with the double slit experiment.\n electrons through two slits at a screen and the pattern you see is not just the sum of electrons going separately through one slit and the other slit. It is an interference pattern. We are forced to conclude that a single electron somehow goes\n through one slit and the other slit simultaneously. This is superposition. Of course, it's easy to understand superposition with waves, they are spread out in space. And it's clear how the peak of a wave from one slit cancels with the trough\n of the wave from another slit to produce the interference pattern. And luckily we know that when we're not looking, electrons are represented by a wave, the wave function. The double slit experiment then is concrete evidence that this wave enables individual electrons to\n pass through both slits at the same time. So superposition is on solid ground. The next concept is entanglement. Consider two electrons fired toward each other with equal and opposite velocities. We know they will scatter off each other,\n But we don't know exactly how. Their trajectories are given by spread out wave functions that only give us probabilities. But as soon as we measure the momentum of one of the electrons, we immediately know the momentum of the other one. It must be equal\n otherwise conservation of momentum would be violated. Now this may seem obvious, but consider that before the measurement the momentum of each electron was in a superposition of states. Measuring one instantaneously collapsed the wave function\n of the other. And this would be true even if those electrons were light years apart. These electrons are entangled. What's really going on here is that after interacting the electrons do not have separate wave functions at all.\n They are described by a single wave function, and this is what it means to be entangled. This explains why measuring one immediately affects the state of the other one, because the single wave function has collapsed. In fact, if we were being rigorous, we'd have\n to say that there is only one wave function, the wave function of the entire universe, which includes absolutely everything. But in the case of isolated, unentangled quantum particles, we can reasonably talk about their individual wave functions.\n and then once they interact with something else, entanglement is the result. So what we've seen is superposition is really the same thing as describing systems with waves. And entanglement means that after particles interact, they are described by a\n single wave function. These are fundamental parts of quantum theory describing systems with wave functions that evolve according to the Schrodinger equation. Which leaves only measurement. Remember the measurement postulate was added as a second\n set of rules to connect the mathematics of quantum mechanics to what we actually observe. But doesn't it seem weird that there should be one rule for how systems evolve when we're not looking and a different rule for when we are? When you boil it down,\n Measurement is just the interaction of one quantum system, electrons and photons, with another quantum system. And we know exactly how to deal with that. We simply evolve their wave functions according to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. So what if we throw out\n all the rules associated with measurement. Well then in the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment, the radioactive atom in a superposition of decayed and not decayed gets entangled with the detector and in turn the cat. Now remember,\n We are also made of electrons and atoms which obey the laws of quantum mechanics, so we are quantum mechanical too. So when we open the box, there is no measurement, no wave function collapse, we simply get entangled with the state of everything inside the box.\n we see the cat alive and we see the cat dead. Now how is that possible? I'm guessing you've never seen both an alive and dead cat before. But the solution is it's because the you that saw the cat alive and the\n the you that saw it dead actually inhabit separate worlds. By that I mean, they exist in their own complete realities and those realities will never interact. But where did these separate worlds come from? Well, something I haven't mentioned yet are all\n the particles of the environment, the air molecules, photons, everything that we are not keeping track of. If a quantum object in a superposition gets entangled with the environment, it is said to undergo environmental decoherence. This branches\n wave function of the universe, essentially splitting the universe into two slightly different copies. So a more realistic account of Schr\u00f6dinger's cat goes like this. The radioactive atom evolves from 100% not decayed into a quantum superposition.\n of decayed and not decayed. The detector becomes entangled with this superposition state of the atom. But the detector is being bombarded by all these air molecules and photons in the box which would bounce off differently if it is detected\n radiation than if it hasn't. So almost immediately the detector becomes entangled with the state of the environment. It decoheres, branching the wave function in two. At that moment, you are split into two identical\n copies, one entangled with each outcome of the experiment. You continue to be identical until you open the box, but in this case the cat actually is alive or dead, you were just finding out by opening the box. What we are unaware of is that the other outcome also\n happened, just as someone who is not you anymore. I mean, both observers came from you, but they are no longer you, and they are no longer identical to each other. This interpretation of quantum mechanics is called many worlds, and it was formulated\n by Hugh Everett. And if it's true, the branching of the wave function is happening all the time, so frequently in fact, that the rate may well be infinite. Creating infinite subtly different worlds all the time may sound implausible, to put it mildly,\n But consider that all those worlds are naturally part of the mathematics of quantum mechanics. Many worlds just takes them seriously. To get rid of them requires something like the collapse of the wave function. And the point is our experience of reality\n would be the same in the many-worlds picture as it is if the wave function collapses. But the formalism is so much cleaner and more elegant. All we have are wave functions that evolve under the Schrodinger equation. The implication is that the founders of quantum theory\n may have got it exactly backwards. The wave function is the complete picture of reality, and our measurement is just a tiny fraction of it, the part we become entangled with when we interact with a quantum object in a superposition. The universe\n goes back to being deterministic. Every outcome happens a hundred percent of the time. It only doesn't look that way to us because we only experience our tiny sliver of the multiverse. Now I imagine that a lot of you have questions and\n possibly objections to this, so I went to the expert.\n literally written the book on many worlds. Here's the book, Something Deeply Hidden, available wherever books are available. Let's ask probably the common sort of YouTube questions, the arguments against this. Yes. You know what the first one is?\n How many worlds are there? The first one is energy conservation. How is energy conserved is completely clear in the math. The energy of the whole wave function is 100% super duper conserved.\n But there's a difference between the energy of the whole wave function and the energy that people in each branch perceive. So what you should think of is not duplicating the whole universe, but taking a certain amount of universe and sort of subdividing it.\n Let's ask the question about how many were on the internet.\n there or how frequently are they branching? Right, we have no idea. There's a short answer to this. And I think it's embarrassing that we don't have any idea. It's certainly often, it's certainly a lot, right? The universe branches whenever a quantum system in superposition becomes entangled with its\n environment. So you have atomic nuclei in your body that are radioactive. They decay 5,000 times a second. There's a radioactive decay in your body. Every one of those either decays or doesn't. You can think of it as a superposition. Once it decays,\n It sort of interacts with what's around it, becomes entangled, and the universe branches. It's wave function, right? So branching is happening many, many times a second just because a radioactive decays in your body. Now, is it happening infinitely often? We don't know.\n because we don't know whether the total number of possible branches is infinitely big or finite. It's jihumongous by any stretch. There's plenty of room for all these branches to exist, and it might very well be finite, but that the details hinge on things\n Let's deal with the misconception that many worlds means everything that could possibly happen happens.\n means the wave function obeys the Schrodinger equation. That's what it means. The Schrodinger equation predicts many things could potentially happen, but not everything. So for example, an electron will never convert into a proton. It would violate conservation of mass,\n conservation of charge, all these things. Things in the Schrodinger equation give zero probability to ever happening. What about you becoming president? Yes, that could happen. There is a world in which you're president? There is a world, well to be super duper clear, it would\n It would not be me who is president, it would be a version of me. Once the branching happens, those are two separate people now. But there is a version of you who is currently president. Yes, that's right. And who is tweeting. It's a very low amplitude world. It's a very small probability, but it's there, yes.\n I think this is the way in which it feels more complicated than, or it feels more ridiculous than Copenhagen, because Copenhagen is like, there's just one world, this is it. That's right. And it's what you experience and... But look, the universe, the good old universe...\n Forget about quantum mechanics, okay? Just like the cosmological universe where we see all the galaxies and everything. We don't see the whole universe. We see a finite amount of it because light moves at the speed of light, so there's a place beyond which we can't see. The universe could be infinitely big. We don't know.\n It's plausible that everywhere in the universe looks more or less like what we see, with galaxies and stars and the whole bit. If that's true, there's an infinite number of copies of people exactly the same.\n like you. Some of them are presidents, some of them are winning NBA championships, some of them are supermodels, whatever. It's just because there's a lot of different shuffling around of the atoms, okay? It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or weirdness. Does that bother you? Is that like\n like rub you the wrong way? Kind of. I think, well, maybe it should. But I agree, it's less weird than the quantum idea. And I think in both cases, it's because human beings, there's some cognitive bias. I don't know what it's called.\n But there's a cognitive bias that says the only probabilities for anything are 0%, 50%, or 100%. And when I tell you something can happen, but the probability is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really low, people are like, but it can happen, right?\n focus on that possibility that it happens. I'm like, no, don't do that. It's just not sufficiently probable that it's worth worrying about in any way. When the world branches here, does it branch instantly far away? The answer is it's up to you.\n So, I can write down a description in which the branching happens instantly throughout all of space. I use that description to make predictions about what people will see. All those predictions come out 100% completely true.\n I can write an alternative description in which the branching sort of spreads out at the speed of light. And I make a different set of predictions, but guess what? They're exactly the same predictions. There's no difference between what those two pictures actually predict. And what this is reflecting is\n God doesn't know about branches. There's the wave function of the universe. That's all that really exists, okay? Breaking the wave function of the universe into different pieces that you and I call branches or worlds is very convenient for us human beings.\n But that's all it is. It's not built into the fabric of reality itself. It's just like, it's exactly like the air in this room. Rather than listing the position and velocity of every single air molecule, I just tell you the temperature and the\n pressure and things like that, right? It's a convenient description for us human beings. It's not the full description of the reality. And branches are exactly the same way. So if you get annoyed that there's two different ways of describing the branching, you have to remember that the whole idea of branching is just a human convenience.\n Hey, this portion of the video is sponsored by Norton 360, a global leader in cyber safety.

            "transcription": "The second law of thermodynamics tells us that everything in the universe tends towards disorder, and in complex systems, chaos is the norm. So you'd naturally expect the universe to be messy. And yet, we can observe occasions\n of spontaneous order, the synchronization of metronomes, the perfectly timed orbits of moons, the simultaneous flashes of fireflies, and even the regular beating of your heart. What puts these things in order?\n disorder, in spite of nature's tendency for disorder. This video was sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the video. On June 10th, 2000, the Millennium Bridge, a new footbridge across the\n River Thames in London was opened to much excitement. But as crowds filled the bridge, it began to wobble back and forth. Police started restricting access to the bridge, but that only resulted in long lines to get on.\n The wobble was unaffected. Two days later, the bridge, which had cost 18 million pounds, was fully closed and it wouldn't reopen for another two years. So what went wrong?\n Well, it's long been known that armies should break step when crossing bridges. This dates back to an accident in 1831, when 74 men from the 60th Rifle Corps were marching across the Broughton Suspension Bridge in Northern England. It collapsed.\n under their synchronized footsteps. 60 men fell into the river, 20 of whom suffered injuries like broken bones or concussions. Luckily, no one was killed. But after this, the British army ordered all troops to break step when\n crossing bridges. Now look at the people walking across the Millennium Bridge. Most of them are walking in step with each other. But they are not part of an army, they're random members of the public.\n So why are they walking together? And why couldn't a modern bridge designed for heavy pedestrian traffic handle this? Well, to understand it, we have to go back 350 years.\n In 1656, famous Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens created the first working pendulum clock. The goal was to help sailors figure out where they were on the globe. Latitude can be judged by measuring the position of the sun\n or stars, but for longitude you also need to know the time at some fixed location, say your home port. But clocks at the time were routinely out by around 15 minutes a day, so they were effectively useless. Huygens' pendulum\n clocks, by contrast, were accurate to around 10 to 15 seconds per day. Huygen's plan was to attach his clocks to a heavy hanging mass on the ship so they wouldn't get tossed around by the rolling seas. His plan called for\n two clocks in case one stopped or was damaged. But testing out this arrangement while at home sick in February 1665, he made a remarkable discovery. Two of his clocks hung from a wood beam across some\n chairs. Watching the pendulums sway back and forth for hours, he noticed after half an hour or so, they would spontaneously synchronize. As one clock swung one way, the second would swing the other way. As one would tick\n the other would talk. So he tried disturbing the clocks. He set them ticking out of sync, but again within 30 minutes or so they were back to the same lockstep. Huygens thought this strange sympathy of clocks\n must have been caused by air currents between the pendulums, so he placed a large board in between them. But the clocks continued to sync up. It wasn't the air currents. When he separated the clocks, the synchrony would disappear. Their time\n drifting apart. But when he brought them back together, the synchrony returned. Huygens realized the two clocks were synchronizing because they were hung from the same wood beam. It transferred mechanical vibrations from one clock to the other.\n making the two oscillators coupled. Huygens was the first to observe this kind of spontaneous synchronization in inanimate objects, and although he qualitatively described what was happening, it was only a few decades ago that scientists started fleshing\n out a rigorous theory of synchronization. You may have seen this demo where you put several metronomes on a light wobbly platform and start them out of sync.\n It's trickier than people make it look. When you do get it to work though, it's kind of magical.\n These metronomes don't have exactly the same natural\n frequency, and yet they still beat in time. To understand how this works, it's easiest to first consider a couple metronomes oscillating in sync with each other. When the large masses accelerate to the left, they push the platform to the right.\n and when they accelerate to the right, they push the platform to the left. So the center of mass of the system always stays roughly in the same spot. Now if you start another metronome completely out of sync with the first two, the motion of the platform gives it a kick every half\n swing, speeding it up until it's in time with the first two.\n This works regardless of the number of metronomes you have. The platform just goes whichever way the majority of metronomes are pushing it.\n We can represent the position of a metronome pendulum or any other oscillator as a point on a circle. This shows its phase, that is what part of the cycle it's in. So you could call the rightmost point of the pendulum zero degrees, and then the leftmost point\n is 180 degrees, and as the pendulum oscillates back and forth, the point goes around the circle. The higher the frequency of the oscillator, the faster that point goes around. So this represents two metronomes with different\n frequencies and this represents two metronomes with the same frequency but completely out of phase. When the metronomes are synchronized in phase their dots go around the circle together. We can use this to\n to illustrate a mathematical model for the synchronizing behavior we've been looking at. It's called the Kuramoto model. It says the rate each dot goes around the circle equals its natural frequency plus some amount related to\n how far it is from all the other dots. Now the size of this term is determined by the coupling strength.\n is faster than you. Your friend says, you know, come on, move it, hurry it up, because you're dawdling, you're slow, you're falling behind. So if you have enough fortitude and you try hard enough, and if the friend is sympathetic enough to slow down,\n then the coupling between you is strong enough to overcome that inherent difference in your natural running speeds. But if you're not very good friends, or if you can't quite suck it up to move yourself faster, then the coupling will not be strong enough to overcome that\n difference and one person will start lapping the other. The Fireflies of Southeast Asia are apparently good enough friends because they synchronize their flashes. Even though each one has its own particular frequency at which it likes to flash, they couple to each\n strongly enough so that hundreds, even thousands, can flash together in the same split second. There's a great simulation of this by Nicky Case. You start with individual fireflies just doing their thing, and then you can turn on the interaction\n between them. Now in the KuroMoto model, this would mean every firefly has an effect on every other one. But in this simulation, a firefly is only affected by its neighbors. If it sees a flash close by, it nudges its internal clock forward a little bit\n bit, so it'll flash sooner than it would have otherwise. Now, what's remarkable about this is even though the interactions are small and close range, over time you can see waves traveling through all the fireflies, and eventually\n They're all flashing at once.\n It's water, water, water as you're lowering the temperature, and then at a critical temperature, the molecules suddenly start to change their state and become solid instead of liquid. And this is a sort of time rather than space version of the same thing.\n This is an audience in Budapest applauding\n after a performance. But what happens next is completely spontaneous. They're not being instructed by anyone. See if you can spot the phase transition.\n This phenomenon of synchronization that we've been talking about, one of the things that I find most appealing about it is how\n universal it is, that it occurs at every scale of nature from subatomic to cosmic. It uses every communication channel that nature has ever devised from gravitational interactions, electrical interactions, chemical,\n I mean, you name it, any way the two things can influence each other, nature uses that to get things in sync. Take our own moon, for example. We only ever see one side of it because it rotates on its axis exactly once.\n for every time it goes around the earth. We say it is tidally locked to the earth and this is a common effect. In our solar system there are 34 moons that are tidally locked to their planet. The way this happens goes something like this.\n A moon starts out with its own rotational frequency, but the gravitational attraction to the planet is stronger on the side closer to the planet, and so it distorts the moon into an egg shape, which is greatly exaggerated here.\n continues to orbit and rotate on its axis, those bulges swing out of alignment with the planet. And so the gravitational force on them is constantly pulling them back into alignment. And this slows the rotation of the moon until it is locked to the planet.\n If the moon is initially rotating too slowly, this same mechanism can speed it up until it's locked. There are all kinds of other beautiful synchronization phenomena in our solar system. The three innermost moons of Jupiter, Io, Europa,\n and Ganymede are not only tidally locked to the planet, they're also in a 1-2-4 orbital resonance with each other. For every time Ganymede goes around Jupiter, Europa goes around twice, and Io four times.\n In the 1950s, some Russian chemists went looking for a chemical reaction that would oscillate, like a chemical analog of a pendulum. Like, could you get something going back and forth, say, between blue and orange?\n over and over again. And naively you might say that's impossible because there's principles of thermodynamics which say that closed systems just increase their entropy over time, that they're just going to come to equilibrium.\n But there's no principle in chemistry or thermodynamics that says you have to go monotonically to equilibrium. You are allowed to oscillate and damp out to equilibrium in an oscillatory way. This is exactly what Boris Belousov and later\n Anatoly Zhabotinsky discovered, so this reaction is known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky or BZ reaction. I've sped it up because it can continue for half an hour or more, oscillating between these colors. It spends more time on\n the burnt orange color, so I've sped up those sections more.\n reaction has the advantage that you really get a sense of the collectivity of, you know, I don't know, quadrillions of molecules, Avogadro's number of molecules all doing the same thing at the same time. On the other hand, if you don't stir, if you just put like\n petri dish of the BZ reaction, you can see something even more amazing, I think, which is that you can see spiral waves of color or target patterns expanding circles of color moving through the liquid. Maybe I should emphasize\n The liquid itself is not moving. It's not like we're seeing ripples on a pond. But what's not still is chemical concentrations. You can see these blue waves in the BZ reaction that are chemical waves, not water waves.\n waves, and that will just propagate and they move at a constant speed or they can look like a spiral that just grows and grows and spins around. And what's really spooky and uncanny about this is that the same phenomenon is seen in the heart. You can see spiral\n waves of electrical excitation in a heart that look exactly like the spiral waves in chemical oscillations and chemical waves in the BZ reaction. And this was the sort of thing that inspired my mentor, a guy named Art Winfrey, who\n He used chemical reaction waves to give himself insight into cardiac arrhythmias. You know, you may have heard the most deadly kind of arrhythmia, the kind that will kill you really in a matter of minutes, ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation in particular.\n Winfrey's work, seeing these rotating spirals on hearts as well as in chemistry, led him to a theory about what's really causing ventricular fibrillation and how could we design, for example, better defibrillators\n So too little synchronization is obviously a problem, but too much\n Such synchronization can also cause trouble. Remember the wobbly millennium bridge? Was it the people walking in step that caused it to oscillate? Actually, kind of the opposite.\n it. The Millennium Bridge was designed to look like a ribbon of light, so its construction is unique. Unlike a typical suspension bridge, its supporting cables run alongside it, stretched taut like guitar strings.\n literature, all designers know that you do not build a footbridge with a resonant frequency equal to the frequency of human walking. So we take about two strides per second, one with your left foot, one with your right foot. So everybody who takes\n civil engineering knows if people are going to walk on the bridge, it better not have a resonant frequency in the vertical direction of two hertz. Okay, everybody knows that, including the people who built the Millennium Bridge. But what they didn't know and what was new that day\n is that half the frequency is also important. A frequency of one cycle a second, which is the frequency with which you put down, say, your left foot. Half the time you're doing your left foot. So why does that matter? Because when you're walking\n across a bridge and you put your left foot down, you put a tiny force sideways on the bridge. And normally that wouldn't matter because people are all walking at their own pace, they're not synchronized, so their sideways forces, which are only about a tenth as big as their downward forces that\n they impart on the bridge. That would be negligible and it wouldn't do anything to the bridge. But if the bridge happens to have a sideways frequency of one cycle a second, which the Millennium Bridge had happened did, then people can actually start to get the bridge\n After the bridge was closed, engineers got their colleagues to walk across it in increasing numbers while they measured its acceleration. With 50 people on the bridge, there was very little motion. At 100, the vibration was very low.\n At 156, there was still no wobble. But with just 10 more people, 166, the acceleration grew dramatically. The bridge swayed.\n weighed just like it had on opening day. The system had undergone a phase transition.\n going faster. If you stand up in a rowboat and it starts moving sideways, people spread their legs apart to try to stabilize themselves and they will actually start to walk in step with the sideways motion of the bridge. You can see footage from the BBC\n of people doing that. It's spectacular and crazy. So it wasn't people walking in sync that got the bridge to wobble, it was the wobbling bridge that got people to walk in sync. And so as the people got in step with the motion of the\n bridge by adopting this weird kind of penguin gate, they ended up inadvertently pumping more energy into the bridge and making its motion worse. And so this was this positive feedback loop between the motion of the crowd causing the bridge to move more, which caused more people\n Once the problem was identified, they could solve it by decreasing the coupling strength. They installed energy dissipating dampers all along the bridge.\n It's a tremendous embarrassment and it costs several million pounds to repair the bridge. In science we do reductionism. All of our science courses tell us the way to solve a problem is to break it into smaller parts and analyze the parts. And that has been phenomenally successful.\n for every branch of science. But the great frontier in science today is what happens when you try to go back to put the parts together to understand the whole. That's the field of complex systems. That's why we don't understand the immune system very well.\n well, we don't understand consciousness very well or the economy. It seems like the whole is more than the sum of the parts. That's the cliche that has entranced me for my whole research career. I want to understand how can you figure out the properties of the whole, given\n the properties\n now so I wanted to reflect on some of the things I really enjoy about them. First of all, my kids want to do these projects with me. When a crate arrives, they're excited to crack it open and start making. And you can do exactly that because everything you need comes right in the box.\n Now my kids are still pretty young, but KiwiCo has eight different subscription lines targeted at different age groups all the way down to newborns. When I was filming for this sponsor segment, my four-year-old completely unprompted proposed doing an experiment.\n we could do all we could do is be romantic. That's a good idea. We could try pushing it and let it go. That's a good idea let's try it. I was so proud that\n came up with that all by himself. And I want him to keep thinking like this, considering the what-ifs and asking bigger questions. A KiwiCo crate is like a thought-starter in a box. Plus it is time to connect, have fun, and be entertained for hours. So if you\n want to try it out go to Kiwico.com slash Veritasium 50 and you'll get 50% off your first month of any crate. I'll put that link down in the description. So I want to thank KiwiCo for sponsoring Veritasium and I want to thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "This video was sponsored by Caseta by Lutron.\n According to the general theory of relativity, gravity is not a force. There are no gravitational fields. Gravity is kind of an illusion. And in this video, I will prove\n it to you by blasting off into outer space. In 3, 2, 1.\n Albert Einstein said the happiest thought of his life was imagining a man falling off the roof of a house. What made Einstein\n Einstein so happy about this wasn't Schadenfreude. It was the realization that this man while he was falling wouldn't feel his own weight. He would be weightless. And anything he dropped on his way down, well, it would remain stationary relative to him.\n or moving in uniform motion. The whole situation would be just like if you were in deep space, not near any large masses, with your spaceship at\n rest, or coasting along at constant velocity. Here, you would feel no weight. Objects would remain stationary relative to you, or if you give them a push, they would move in a straight line at constant\n velocity. And you would be the very definition of an inertial observer. You're not accelerating, not in a gravitational field, all the laws of physics apply in your reference frame. Meaning there is no experiment you could\n do to distinguish your inertial reference frame from any other? Now here comes the big leap. Einstein looks at these two scenarios and says they are equivalent, not just similar,\n Physically, they are exactly the same thing. Which means, man falling from roof is not in a gravitational field. There are no gravitational fields. And he is not accelerating. He is an inertial observer just like Rocket Man. Whoa, whoa!\n Whoa, whoa, I mean, okay, I can see how both of these observers feel weightless, but man falling from roof is clearly in a gravitational field. I mean, he's right next to the earth and he's obviously accelerating. His speed is increasing by 9.5.\n meters per second every second, a fact that will become painfully apparent when he crashes into the ground. I know that these two situations look very different, but Einstein's equivalence principle tells us the one thing to focus on, the experience\n of the observer. If they feel weightless, then they are in an inertial frame of reference. Every bit as good as Rocketman's out drifting through deep space. Imagine if Rocketman, coasting along at constant velocity and not paying attention,\n comes upon a planet a long way off in the distance. An external observer might notice that the path of the rocket bends ever so slightly towards the planet.\n But inside, Rocketman would remain oblivious. He feels no force, experiences no acceleration. As the rocket gets closer to the planet, it goes faster and faster. But Rocketman still feels weightless. For him, nothing has changed.\n So where on this journey would you say the frame of reference changes from inertial to non-inertial? An onboard accelerometer would never even register a blip. He has continued on his inertial path through spacetime. So the logical conclusion is that\n conclusion is, his frame of reference is inertial, up until the instant he crashes into the planet. Okay, so how do you explain the curved path of his\n rocket without gravitational forces or gravitational fields? The answer is curved spacetime. First, focus on rocket man's observation that the whole time he felt like he was moving with constant velocity in a straight line. He was moving\n moving in a straight line through spacetime. But spacetime around massive objects like planets is curved. So that's why his path appeared curved to a distant observer. Now this isn't as unusual as it seems. Airplanes, for example,\n They always try to fly the shortest route between cities. Essentially, they just go in a straight line. But since the Earth's surface is curved, the shortest path doesn't look like a straight line. These shortest paths over curved surfaces are called geodesics, and we use\n that same word, geodesics, for the straight-line paths followed by inertial observers through curved spacetime. Here's another analogy. Imagine you and a friend are standing a thousand kilometers apart on the equator. Now you both set off\n due north. Over time, you will come closer together, ultimately bumping into each other at the north pole. It's as though there was a force pushing you together. But you didn't feel a force, and your friend didn't feel a force. Gravity is just\n like that force. It doesn't actually exist. The real reason for you coming together was that you were both on straight paths, geodesics, on a curved surface. Astronauts on the space station are\n That means they too are inertial observers traveling on a geodesic. But the Earth curves space-time around it, which is why their straight-line path appears as a helix. It only looks like a circular orbit.\n This is the standard bent sheet analogy for curved spacetime.\n I think this demo is misleading. It allows you to fool yourself into thinking you understand general relativity when the intuition you're actually drawing on is just that objects like to fall towards the middle of a well due to the gravitational force.\n But in general relativity, there is no gravitational force. What you should be thinking about is objects traveling on a straight line path through space-time. It just so happens that space-time is curved around massive objects. So that straight line path\n path doesn't look like a straight line. Matter tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells matter how to move. Now let's go back to deep space.\n What happens if you turn on the rocket thrusters and accelerate at 9.8 meters per second squared? Well, someone outside would see all objects remain stationary, while the floor of the rocket accelerates\n to them. Inside the rocket, everything would appear to accelerate down to the ground, and you would feel a force pushing up on your feet.\n the same force that's pushing up on you as you watch this video. This situation feels exactly the same as being at rest on the surface of Earth.\n Because we are at rest on the surface of Earth. Now I want to ask you, are you watching this video in an inertial frame of reference? Well, I mean, do you feel weightless? No. So you are not an inertial frame of reference.\n inertial observer. Your situation is exactly the same as someone accelerating on a rocket ship in deep space. And let me be clear, I don't mean that being at rest in a gravitational field is like accelerating in a rocket. I mean it is the exact same thing.\n You are accelerating and there is no gravitational field. Gravitational fields do not exist. Now I know that sounds crazy, but come with me for a minute.\n This is you. In standard Newtonian physics, we draw your weight force, the force of gravity pushing you down, and the normal force from the floor pushing you up.\n We say these forces are equal and opposite, so there's no net force on you, so you are not accelerating. But in general relativity, gravity is not a force. You have no weight, so the only force on you are these normal\n forces pushing you up. So you are accelerating upwards. But I'm not moving up. Relative to what? I mean, relative to the flip chart and the floor and basically everything in this room. But all of those things are in your frame of reference, which you know\n is not inertial. Relative to everything in my rocket ship, I'm not accelerating. What you need if you really want to measure your acceleration is someone in an inertial frame of reference, like the guy who fell off a\n roof and he would see you accelerating up at 9.8 meters per second squared. I think what this shows is that what an acceleration really is is it's a deviation from a geodesic.\n You can't follow a straight line path through space-time because the floor prevents you from doing that. It applies a force upwards on you, so you're accelerating up. But if I'm accelerating up, and so is everyone else around me,\n the world and presumably the whole surface of the Earth, then shouldn't the Earth be expanding? No. It is possible for you to be accelerating even though your spatial coordinates are not changing. I will show you one equation from\n general relativity. This says that the second derivative of your position with respect to time is equal to your acceleration, that's just f on m, and if you were in flat spacetime, well this is exactly\n exactly what you're saying. If you're accelerating, your spatial coordinates have to change. But you're not in flat spacetime. And this term is related to the curvature of spacetime. And this is your velocity through time squared. You don't have to\n worry about the details here, the point is your position can be not changing, this can be zero, which means your acceleration must be exactly equal to this this curvature term times your\n velocity through time squared. So in curved space-time, you need to accelerate just to stand still. A lot of this may seem more complicated than Newtonian physics, but one classic\n classical mystery looks a whole lot simpler in general relativity, which is why all objects fall at the same rate. I have made a number of videos on this topic, and I would always give the standard newtonian\n explanation. The only force on a free-falling body is its weight, gmm on r squared, which equals its mass times acceleration. You can cancel the object's mass on both sides of the equation, hence all objects will have this same acceleration.\n The mystery is why we could cancel these two M's. The one on the left was gravitational mass, the property of an object that creates and experiences a gravitational field, while the M on the right is inertial mass, a measure of\n resistance to acceleration. Why should these two conceptually different properties be numerically identical? Scientists have spent a lot of time and effort experimentally testing down to around one part intended\n trillion that these two types of mass really are the same. But in general relativity, there is no mystery. All objects appear to fall the same way because they're not accelerating, they're just following straight-line paths\n through spacetime until they encounter something that stops them. Like the objects in the rocket ship, they appear to accelerate at the same rate because they're not really accelerating, it's the floor accelerating into them.\n This might seem pretty far-fetched, as it did back in 1915 when Einstein proposed it, so he very cleverly came up with a measurable prediction that scientists could make to test his theory. Imagine that this rocket ship is coasting through deep space.\n If you shine a light beam across the rocket ship, well, it'll do exactly what you expect. Light travels in a straight line and hits a point on the opposite wall at exactly the same height as the source. But now, what if this rocket is accelerating?\n Well, to an external observer, they're still going to see the same thing, light traveling in a straight line. But inside the rocket, during the time it takes the light to travel across the cabin, the rocket will have sped up. So by the time it hits the other\n wall it'll hit a little lower than before. So in an accelerating frame of reference light deflects down. Here I am dramatically exaggerating the effect. Even if I were accelerating a\n up at 10 G's, which would probably kill me, the deflection would be on the order of the width of a proton. Still, it shows that an accelerating frame of reference will bend light. So, Einstein reasoned,\n Light must also bend when it passes a large mass. But where do you find a mass large enough? Well, the only obvious huge mass near the Earth is the Sun. So the ideal experiment would be to look at light\n passing just next to the sun and see if it is deflected. Say, light from distant stars. The problem was, of course, the sun is just so bright you can't see stars right next to it. Unless there is a total solar eclipse.\n which is exactly what happened in 1919. So Arthur Eddington set out to take pictures of the stars right next to the Sun during totality. And what he found by analyzing those pictures was that their positions appeared\n here deflected by the precise amount predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.\n to it over the past hundred years or so. But there are still more things to try. A well-known and empirically validated finding is that accelerating charges\n radiation. So one conceptually simple experimental test would be to compare the behavior of a stationary charge in a gravitational field to a free-falling one. If a more Newtonian picture of gravity is\n Well then the stationary charge should not radiate electromagnetic radiation, but a free-falling one is accelerating and therefore it should radiate. In contrast, general relativity sees the free-falling charge as non-accelerating,\n just going on a straight line path through curved spacetime, whereas the stationary charge is accelerating and therefore it should give off electromagnetic radiation. Now thus far logistical challenges have prevented anyone from actually carrying out this experiment\n experiment, but what you believe will happen reveals what you truly think about the nature of gravity. Do you think that a freely falling charge will radiate electromagnetic radiation? Or not? Is gravity\n an illusion? This episode was sponsored by Caseta and so I used the sponsorship money to have a rocket ship built.\n Caseta by Lutron makes the smart light switches in the rocket ship. They also make remotes, motion sensors, smart plugs, basically every smart switch you could use for turning things in your home on and off. But installing a smart switch isn't rocket science.\n Just turn off the power to the switch, detach the existing wires, and reconnect them to the Caseta Smart Switch. What's great about smart switches as opposed to smart bulbs is one switch often controls multiple bulbs, so you can save money by replacing only the\n the switch, and they connect to most smart devices like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, and you can control them via an app on your phone. So if you forget to turn off the lights in the rocket, no need to go back, just turn them off in the\n the app. You can also use the app to set up schedules, turning the lights on when it goes dark. This gives you peace of mind knowing your family will always come home to a well-lit house. We may not have personal rockets yet, but we have smart switches and the smart\n for these devices is Caseta by Lutron."

            "transcription": "J. Robert Oppenheimer might be the most important physicist to have ever lived. He never won a Nobel Prize, but he changed the world more than most Nobel Prize winners. Under his leadership, the best physicist of the 20th century,\n built the atomic bomb, forever changing the course of history. He has affected every war waged and every peace settlement\n since the end of World War II. He also created a way for humanity to destroy itself. Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. This video is about how to build an atomic bomb.\n the life of Oppenheimer, and why serious scientists were worried about the explosion setting fire to the atmosphere, ending all life on Earth. Part of this video is brought to you by Wren.\n When J. Robert Oppenheimer was 21, he placed an apple laced with toxic chemicals on the desk of his physics tutor. The tutor, Patrick Blackett, was an experimentalist, and he had hounded Robert to do more of\n what he thought Robert wasn't very good at, experimental work. Oppenheimer had already been spending his days in a corner of J.J. Thompson's basement laboratory, attempting to make thin films of beryllium, which were used to study electrons. But Oppenheimer was\n clumsy and not good at this work. He was soon avoiding his duties in the lab, spending his time listening to lectures and reading physics journals. It was 1925 and the 21 year old Oppenheimer was becoming fascinated by the new\n field of quantum mechanics. Despite being surrounded by brilliant physicists like Rutherford and Chadwick, Oppenheimer was deeply unhappy. He wrote,\n and I'm so bad at it that it's impossible to feel that I'm learning anything. A friend walked in on him lying on the floor of his room, which he called a miserable hole, groaning and rolling from side to side in emotional anguish. It was\n In this state, Robert attempted to poison Blackett. The specifics are lost to history. There are conflicting reports if Oppenheimer used cyanide or something he found in the lab which would have just made Blackett sick. This story sounds\n Unbelievable, but Oppenheimer himself confirmed it. Luckily, Blackett did not eat the apple, but the attempted poisoning became known to the Cambridge University authorities. Robert's parents were visiting their son from the US at the time and\n Julius Oppenheimer successfully lobbied Cambridge not to press criminal charges. Due to his family's wealth, Robert wasn't even expelled from Cambridge on the condition that he had periodic counselling sessions with a psychiatrist in London.\n In the summer of 1926, Robert traveled to the University of G\u00f6ttingen. The chairman of the department was Max Born, who just two years earlier had coined the term quantum mechanics. Born was reportedly a thought\n full and gentle teacher, and had nurtured the work of Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi, and Eugene Wigner. Basically, the who's who of quantum mechanics. The class that Oppenheimer was in was also extraordinary, including luminaries like Paul Dirac\n and John von Neumann. Where the academic culture at Cambridge focused on experimental physics, G\u00f6ttingen was all about theoretical physics. And under Max Born's mentorship, Oppenheimer thrived. His mental health improved and he found a community\n of people who were as obsessed with physics as he was. On November 14th, 1926, Robert wrote to Frank, his younger brother,\n Robert was thriving and his talent was being recognized. Boren later wrote, he was a man of great talent and he was conscious of his superiority in a way which was embarrassing and led to trouble. When Oppenheimer was 23 he\n graduated with his PhD in physics. He wrote his thesis in German on the quantum theory of continuous spectra. All in all, he published more than a dozen papers in the two years he was at Goodingen. Many of them expanded upon the work of Werner Heidelberg.\n Heisenberg, who was just three years older than Oppenheimer. The two eventually met in 1927, the same year Heisenberg published his groundbreaking paper on the quantum uncertainty principle. By all accounts, the pair got along well.\n There was no way to know that just 15 years later, they would be deadly rivals, attempting to build the first nuclear bomb, Oppenheimer for the USA and Heisenberg for Nazi Germany. At the time, it was thought that getting significant\n amounts of energy out of radioactive atoms was impossible. Ever since the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel, Marie and Pierre Curie in the late 1890s, it was known that radioactivity was a passive process.\n Unstable atoms would just decay at random, unpredictable times. And surely there was no way to control that. In 1933, Ernest Rutherford, Oppenheimer's old boss from Cambridge, wrote that anyone who expects us\n source of power from the transformations of these atoms is talking moonshine. That same year Albert Einstein said that there is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will.\n So how would you break an atomic nucleus? Well, you could take a proton and accelerate it through a large electric field and then smash it into a nucleus. This is exactly what John Cockroft and Ernest Walton did in a\n 1932. They accelerated protons into lithium nuclei, breaking them apart. The pair would later win a Nobel Prize for this work. But a proton is positively charged, so it's repelled by all nuclei which are also\n positively charged. So to give them a hope of overcoming this barrier, Cockroft and Walton had to use 250,000 volts to accelerate the protons. Even then, only about 1 in a billion protons actually hit and split\n lit a lithium nucleus. So this would not be an effective way to get energy. But there is another way. In 1932, the neutron was discovered, this subatomic particle that's about\n 0.1% heavier than a proton and it has no electric charge. So a neutron would not be repelled from a nucleus. And in 1933 Leo Szilard was thinking about how you could use neutrons to split nuclei.\n It suddenly occurred to me that if we could find an element which is split by neutrons and which would emit two neutrons when it absorbed one neutron, such an element, if assembled in sufficiently large mass, could sustain a nuclear chain reaction.\n action. But the thing is, nobody knew if there was an element that had a kind of nucleus that would do that. On the 29th of January 1939, Luis Alvarez, a promising young physicist, was getting a haircut\n while reading the San Francisco Chronicle. Suddenly, he got out of the chair halfway through the haircut and ran to Oppenheimer's office. Alvarez read an article about how two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, had successfully split an\n atom of uranium by bombarding it with neutrons. Oppenheimer was not impressed. That's impossible, he reportedly told the young alvarez, proceeding to mathematically prove on his blackboard why fission could never be achieved.\n But the next day, Alvarez had repeated the experiment and invited Oppenheimer to see it. Alvarez later recalled that in less than 15 minutes, he not only agreed that the reaction was authentic, but also speculated that in the process\n extra neutrons would boil off that could be used to split more uranium atoms and thereby generate power or make bombs. When a single atom of uranium-235 splits apart, it loses a little bit of mass, which is released as\n energy, following Einstein's mass-energy equivalence. That is a tiny amount of energy, about 20 times less than the amount required to raise a grain of sand the thickness of a piece of paper. But atoms are also tiny.\n In a 1 kilogram lump of uranium, there are about a trillion trillion atoms. So the energy quickly adds up. Soon almost everyone was convinced. In August of 1939, Einstein, who just six years earlier was\n believed that nuclear bombs were impossible, signed his name to a letter addressed to President Franklin Roosevelt. The letter, actually written by Szilard, warned Roosevelt of the possibility of nuclear weapons. It also pointed out that Germany had access to uranium from the mines\n in Czechoslovakia, which was recently taken over by the Nazis. Roosevelt began an informal uranium committee to discuss this topic, but then for two years nothing happened.\n Roosevelt upgraded the informal uranium committee to the S-1 committee, which would report directly to the White House. The explicit goal was to develop an atomic bomb. And in May 1942, Oppenheimer was hired onto the committee.\n to be the coordinator of rapid rupture. So why was he selected? Well, after completing his PhD, Oppenheimer became a physics professor, first at UC Berkeley,\n and then at Caltech. The brilliance he had shown under Max Born's tutelage didn't fade. Indeed, it blossomed into a remarkable but strange physics career. In the 15 years after finishing his PhD, Oppenheimer made important contributions\n He had a number of Nobel Prize-winning ideas, one of his students, Willis Lamb, became a Nobel Laureate, but Oppenheimer himself was nominated three times but never\n actually won the Nobel Prize. When asked why he thought that Oppenheimer never won the Nobel Prize, Murray Gell-Mann said that he didn't have sitzfleisch, a German word that translates to sitting flesh, the ability\n to sit down in a chair for a long time and do the hard work. He never wrote a long paper or did a long calculation. He didn't have the patience for that. Wolfgang Pally also said, his ideas are very good, but his calculations are\n was wrong. But Oppenheimer was amazing with people. He was a natural and charismatic leader. And this combination, his charisma and his ability to generate great ideas would serve him well in the\n next phase of his life. On the 18th of September 1942, General Leslie Groves was put in charge of the Manhattan Project.\n On day one, he ordered 1,200 tons of uranium ore. The next day, he ordered to buy the Oak Ridge site, where the ore would be refined. The next month, in a surprising move, he chose Oppenheimer to be the site\n The military establishment had concerns. Oppenheimer did not have\n a Nobel Prize, so would the scientists hired for the project respect his opinion and follow his leadership? Oppenheimer also had no prior administrative experience over a large project like this. Furthermore, he was a theoretical physicist, who according to\n Isidore Rabi was a very impractical fellow. He didn't know anything about equipment. And then there was the problem of Oppenheimer's political stance. He had links to the Communist Party, including his wife Catherine, who was a member of\n that party.\n thought that Oppenheimer was a real genius, saying that why Oppenheimer knows about everything? He can talk to you about anything you bring up. Well, not exactly. He doesn't know anything about sports. The two men couldn't have been more different.\n Oppenheimer weighed half as much as Groves, despite both of them being nearly 6 feet tall. Ideologically, Oppenheimer was a communist, Groves a staunch conservative. But Groves was convinced that Oppenheimer would be the person that would build the\n atomic bomb before the Nazis. And that was all that mattered. Isidore Rabi later commented that hiring Oppenheimer for this role was a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius.\n The Manhattan Project needed a location, somewhere isolated to keep the project secret, safe from enemy attack, and while no one wanted to admit it, somewhere that was sparsely populated just in case there was an accident.\n He had fallen in love with the harsh desert and the mountains of New Mexico when he was in his twenties. In 1929, Oppenheimer wrote to a friend,\n But Oppenheimer had severely underestimated the logistical challenge ahead. In 1943, Oppenheimer estimated that he'd need about six scientists, supported by a handful of engineers\n engineers and technicians to make a bomb. He was off by two orders of magnitude. 764 scientists would end up working for the Manhattan Project, 302 of which would work at the Los\n Over 600,000 people in total were involved with the making of the atomic bomb. By this point, making the atom bomb didn't seem impossible, it seemed likely.\n On the 2nd of December 1942, a team of physicists at the University of Chicago, led by Enrico Fermi, created the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, Pile-1. It consisted of 45\n tons of uranium and uranium oxide and 330 tons of graphite blocks. Horrifyingly enough, it was located under the stands of the football field. It generated about half a watt of power.\n And if you can make a nuclear power plant, you can make a bomb. The only real difference between the two is how many neutrons hit the next atom causing it to split and release more neutrons. If on average that number is 1, there will be a stable self-sustaining chain reaction.\n This is known as the multiplication factor K. Nuclear reactions are similar to pandemics in this way.\n way. The simplest way to make a nuclear bomb is to get enough fissile material close together that it creates a runaway chain reaction. That amount is known as the critical mass. With uranium-235\n you need about 52 kilograms, forming a sphere with a diameter of 17 centimeters. If you use plutonium 239, the critical mass is much smaller, only around 10 kilograms, which would create a sphere only 10 centimeters wide.\n For the first few years, the scientists worked on a bomb with a gun-type design. Inside a gun-type bomb, you have two slabs of uranium-235, both of which are below the critical mass. Then, using a conventional explosive\n like cordite, you rapidly fire one towards the other, so the combined mass is higher than the critical mass. When the uranium bullet is about 25 centimeters away, the nuclear chain reaction begins, resulting\n in an atomic explosion. Despite the simple design, it is not very efficient, only a small percentage of the uranium undergoes fission, so the total yield of the bomb is much smaller. You also run into some unexpected problems,\n Like, how do you make sure the uranium slides smoothly through the barrel? Well, you use oil to lubricate the barrel. But all the synthetic oils the scientists tried would dry up. In the end, the only oil they could find that would\n And work was the oil from sperm whales. Only about 0.7% of naturally occurring uranium is U-235, the fissile fuel for nuclear bombs.\n When uranium absorbs a neutron, it briefly becomes U236 and then it rips itself roughly in half and releases, on average, 2.4 neutrons per fission. But when you get uranium out of the ground, most of it is U238,\n doesn't undergo fission. So to make a nuclear bomb, the scientists used gigantic mass spectrometers to separate out and concentrate the U-235. And the resulting substance was uranium with a much higher concentration of\n In other words, it was enriched. There was another option though. In early 1941, a new element was discovered, or rather, synthesized. When a neutron is absorbed by a nucleus of uranium-238,\n There are three things that matter for this story. First is that Plutonium-239\n is a great fuel for a nuclear bomb. It has a critical mass of only about 10 kilograms. Second, it is cheaper to make than to separate uranium-235. And third, it reacts too quickly to be used in a gun type device. It would fizzle, meaning\n meaning only a tiny fraction of the fuel would undergo fission. But there is a way to make a bomb using plutonium. Critical mass changes depending on the density of the material. Under normal pressure conditions, 6kg of plutonium-239\n won't explode, but if you compress it, the atoms get closer together and the chance of a stray neutron hitting the nucleus increases. So the higher the density, the lower the critical mass. So if you set off\n conventional explosives around a ball of plutonium, you can get it compressed enough to start a nuclear chain reaction. And this was the whole idea behind the implosion bomb design.\n There are a couple ways to cheat, lowering the critical mass. For one thing, you surround the sphere with a material that reflects neutrons, decreasing the amount of nuclear fuel you need to start a chain reaction. You can also have a neutron source, something that kickstarts the chain\n reaction. For the first implosion bomb, scientists created a device called the urchin, which was a tiny pellet weighing just 7 grams and it would sit at the heart of the bomb. It was made of beryllium and polonium,\n separated by a layer of nickel and gold. The idea was that when the explosives detonated, the shockwave would mix the beryllium and polonium together, and then the alpha particles from polonium would cause the beryllium to release a flood of neutrons.\n which would set off the nuclear chain reaction. At least that was the hope. An atomic bomb had never been made before. Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists at Los Alamos needed to act quickly. It was already 1945.\n And Truman wanted to test the weapon before the start of the Potsdam Conference. That's where Truman, Churchill, and Stalin would come together to plan the post-war peace. The conference began on the 17th of July, the earliest date that\n The night before, Oppenheimer was nervous.\n nervous. There were so many things that could go wrong. The last test firing of the explosives, without the actual plutonium core, was a failure. To calm himself, he recited a stanza from the Bhagavad Gita, the\n sacred Hindu poem. He had actually translated the Gita from the original Sanskrit himself.\n Perhaps more terrifying than the idea of the bomb not working,\n was that it would work too well. Around 1942, Oppenheimer discussed with Arthur Compton a terrible possibility that a nuclear test could end the world.\n The worry was that the nuclear bomb would create temperatures so hot that fusion would occur. A tiny fraction of the atmosphere, just one part in two million, is hydrogen gas.\n was that at high enough temperatures and pressures, that hydrogen could fuse together, releasing energy. This energy would fuse more hydrogen. It could also break apart the hydrogen from water vapor, causing that to fuse as well.\n That would release even more energy, causing yet more fusion, until the entirety of the Earth's atmosphere would become a giant fusion bomb. Recalling his conversations with Oppenheimer, in 1959 Compton said,\n Nor was this all that Oppenheimer feared. The nitrogen in the air is also unstable, though in less degree. Might not it too be set off by an atomic explosion in the atmosphere? Most of the scientists quickly realized how\n unlikely this scenario was and they continued on with the project. So no one took the idea too seriously. But the thought of starting a fusion reaction with a fission weapon would become very important after the war.\n The Trinity test was scheduled for 4am, but it was delayed due to a storm. So at 5, 29, and 21 seconds, the gadget, the world's first nuclear bomb, detonated.\n The high explosive squeezed the core of plutonium inwards. The shockwave mixed the beryllium and polonium, releasing a flood of neutrons. The urchin worked. It jumpstarted the nuclear reaction, and now they were\n was no way to stop it. Just 6 kilograms of plutonium created an explosion that was equivalent to nearly 25,000 tons of TNT. The New Mexico mountains were illuminated brighter than in daytime.\n The shockwave was felt from over 160 kilometers away. The mushroom cloud rose to 12 kilometers into the sky. It was so hot that the desert sand melted into a glassy mineral now known as trinitum.\n Fortunately, the blast did not set fire to the atmosphere. On August 6, 1945, the Boeing B-29 Flying Fortress dropped little boy,\n a gun-type nuclear bomb with 64kg of enriched uranium. The nitrocellulose ignited, pushing the slugs of uranium-235 together, tipping it over its critical mass. The blast from the explosion, equivalent to\n 15,000 tons of TNT killed nearly 70,000 people. Another 70,000 would die from burns and radiation poisoning in the following months. Three days later, an implosion-type\n like the gadget, was dropped on Nagasaki, killing an estimated 80,000 more people. More than 95% of the 225,000 people killed in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians.\n civilians. Most were women and children. In 1965, recalling the moments after the Trinity test, Oppenheimer said that he thought of another verse from the Gita.\n The world would not be the same. Few people laughed. Few people cried. Most people were silent.\n I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince\n that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, now I am become death, the\n After the war, Oppenheimer was a national hero. His portrait was on the cover of Time Magazine, and he became\n In 1947, he became the director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton. He also became the chairman of the General Advisory Committee, where he became an advisor on nuclear weapons-related issues.\n He used his position to argue for arms control. In August 1949, the Soviet Union tested their first atomic weapon.\n And the US military quickly decided that the best course of action was to develop a more powerful bomb, the hydrogen bomb known as the Super. Oppenheimer was against the development of the Super on ethical grounds.\n and the worry that it would start an arms race. But Truman's administration pushed through, and three years later, Ivy Mike, the first hydrogen bomb, was tested in the Marshall Islands. It had a yield of 10.4\n tons of TNT. That's 400 times more powerful than the Trinity test. A hydrogen bomb is actually three bombs in one. A conventional bomb\n a fission bomb, and a fusion bomb. The conventional explosives trigger a fission reaction, which increases the temperature and pressure enough to fuse deuterium and tritium together, releasing a huge amount of energy.\n In 1961, the Soviet Union tested the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful explosion ever detonated. It was another five times more powerful than Ivy Mike, around 2,000 times more powerful than Trinity.\n This kind of arms race was exactly what Oppenheimer had feared. In part, due to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb and due to his calls to avert a nuclear arms race, Oppenheimer was essentially put on trial to revoke his security\n He had been surveilled while he was working for the Manhattan Project, but that surveillance didn't stop after he left. Many of the wiretaps were illegal and warrantless. Oppenheimer was questioned about his ties to the Communist Party, including his affair with Jean Tatlock.\n a communist party member, while he was leading the Los Alamos lab. He was essentially accused of treason and espionage. In December 1953, Oppenheimer had his security clearance suspended. His face\n In 1964, German playwright Heinar Kipphart wrote a play about opposition.\n Oppenheimer was sent a copy of this script and he hated it so much that he threatened to sue. He especially despised the final scene where the character of Oppenheimer realizes the evil of his work and I quote,\n we have been doing the work of the devil. To Oppenheimer, it was always more complicated than that.\n were not over and not clearly to be brought to a conclusion by diplomatic means this weapon would\n play a part. At the time, the alternative, the campaign of invasion, was certainly much more terrible for everyone concerned. I think that\n Hiroshima was far more costly in life and suffering and inhumane than it needed to have been to have been ineffective.\n In 1965 he was asked about the recent proposal of talks with the Soviet Union to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons and his response was\n It should have been done the day after Trinity. Later that same year, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. He was a lifelong smoker.

            "transcription": "This is a video about avalanches. What they are, what causes them, how destructive ones can be prevented, and what to do if you're ever caught in one. To actually feel the force of the avalanche on your body.\n your son and I think that you can't prepare for that.\n driven through the mountains in winter, or have gone skiing at a resort, you were kept safe by the knowledge gained by snow scientists, avalanche forecasters, and ski patrollers.\n The most deadly avalanche, the first result will be from May 1970, when the town of Yun-Gai and 10 nearby villages were destroyed. An estimated 30,000 people were killed, but the avalanche was triggered by a 7.9%\n magnitude earthquake, and the avalanche caused a landslide which buried the town, so it wasn't really avalanche destruction. The deadliest snow avalanches happened in December of 1916, during\n World War I. Some of the fighting took place in the Dolomites, a mountain range in northern Italy. There, thousands of Italian troops were battling Austro-Hungarian soldiers, and it had been a particularly snowy winter. Over\n 12 meters of snow had fallen on the mountain range in the first week of December. On the 13th of December, a single avalanche wiped out the Austrian barracks near Mount Marmelada, killing at least 275 people.\n But its flow-on effects were far more devastating. Both sets of troops realized they could use snow as a weapon. So soldiers on both sides fired artillery shells into the mountain above their enemies.\n camps, deliberately triggering avalanches. Over the next few days, between 2,000 and 10,000 soldiers died, buried underneath the snow. But most deadly avalanches aren't triggered\n by earthquakes or artillery shells, they're triggered by skiers, snowboarders, and snowmobilers recreating in the backcountry. 93% of fatal avalanches in the US were triggered by the weight of the victim, or someone in the victim's party.\n So, how could something so massive and destructive be triggered by the weight of just a single human? This is Bruce Tremper. He literally wrote the book on avalanches, the book which inspired us to make this video.\n I was a hardcore ski racer, but when I was done racing, then I started building lifts for the Bridger Pole Ski Patrol, and I got caught in my first avalanche. My job for that day was tightening of all the bolts at the base of each chairlift tower.\n because we were doing our load test that day. So they'd warn me, okay, once you get done with this tower, whatever you do, don't cross that big avalanche path below it. You know, and I made some snide remark like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know about all that stuff.\n don't worry about me, you know. When I got done tightening those bolts, then I realized I made a really serious error because I was just wallowing up to my chest and I almost needed to take out a shovel and dig like a tunnel through the snow to get back up to the ridge.\n and it was just exhausting work. And then I, that cocky, I thought, well, I've heard about these ski cuts. I can just build up my speed and get to the other side because that's where I wanted to be anyway. Like an idiot, that's what\n I did. The first thing that happens when an avalanche breaks is it just starts moving and the first thing you do is kind of flop over on the snow because you lose your balance like somebody pulls a rug out from underneath you and you fall up in\n And there I was just kind of laying in the snow getting drug down the mountain, you know, I was caught I couldn't get out of it And luckily I was able to grab a small tree, but the snow is just beating me to death, you know and just about snap\n happened off my neck as it's going by me on this tree. Luckily, a lot of that snow went by and that's why I didn't die that day. But then the tree finally snapped off or something happened and I was, you know,\n tumbling down the avalanche path. Luckily when I got to the bottom, I was only buried up to my chest. I was in the tail of the avalanche and the avalanche dies from the tail first, so that slows down while the front part keeps moving, you know.\n I had a lot of time to think about that for the rest of the day, tightening the rest of those bolts and thinking, holy smokes, I could have died, I should have died and I didn't. You're tightening bolts, you were caught in an avalanche and then you...\n went back to Titan Balls that day. You went back to work. Oh yeah, yeah. Somebody had to do it. I was the guy. That was my job. You know, I was raised by my father. You get the job done, you know.\n At the most basic level, an avalanche happens when the crystalline bonds between the snow crystals break, and the force of friction holding the snow on the mountain isn't enough to counteract the pull of gravity. Avalanches are categorized by size,\n on a scale of 1 to 5. 1 would not be large enough to bury a person, but size 5 would involve 100,000 cubic meters of snow traveling many kilometers causing destruction on a massive scale. The first thing\n to note is that snow isn't uniform. The snowpack is built up one storm at a time, so it's layered. And these layers aren't all the same. And they change over time due to the conditions they're exposed to.\n The air temperature, humidity, sun, wind, and rain all affect the structure of the snow. For example, after fresh snow has fallen, if there's a warm sunny day, the snow will melt and then refreeze overnight,\n creating a sheet of ice. The most important condition is the temperature gradient in the snowpack, but we'll come to that. The snowpack preserves a record of everything that has happened to it. If you dig a pit into the snow, you can read the different\n layers to understand its past. Nine different avalanche problems are recognized, but there are two main types, slab and loose. There are two types of loose avalanche\n The snow in dry loose avalanches is, well, loose. The snow isn't all stuck together, so after it's triggered, it fans out. Sometimes loose avalanches are also known as pointy avalanches.\n dry loose avalanches are commonly known by skiers as slough and they usually aren't a serious hazard though they can drag a skier off a cliff it's funny because like in the skiing community we've just said like this one\n kind of avalanche isn't an avalanche we just call it something else. I had a run-in with Slough yesterday at Hellrunner and you just feel like this wall of snow pushing you from the back. Honestly it's kind of fun it's fun it's like it's kind of like surfing where it's dynamic\n Another type of avalanche is wet loose.\n I'm hearing on like south facing aspects. The sun heats up the snow and makes it more dense and slushy and runny. The sun's starting to come out. I'm not currently too worried about wet loose right now, but I will be in about an hour.\n But the more deadly avalanches are slab avalanches, where the top layer of snow becomes stuck together, like a cohesive slab. When the avalanche is triggered, the snow releases together in big chunks.\n slab avalanches depends on the angle of the ski slope. Under 25 degrees, there isn't likely to be a slab avalanche because gravity just isn't strong enough to pull the snow down the mountain. Any slope steeper than 50 degrees is also unlike\n likely to have dangerous avalanches. The slope is so steep that it's hard for much snow to accumulate. Regular small sloughs and slab avalanches prevent the buildup of larger, more dangerous slabs. 75% of dangerous slab\n A lot of avalanches occur between 34 and 45 degrees. For comparison, a black diamond ski run is typically around 30 degrees, and a double black diamond is around 40 degrees. In other words, the best condition for a ski run is around 40 degrees.\n What's really terrifying about slab avalanches is you can trigger them remotely. You could be skiing or walking on a slope that is far less than 30 degrees and trigger an avalanche on\n a steeper slope above you. And slab avalanches are fast, they can reach speeds up to 120kmh.\n Slab avalanches have three parts to them. A bed surface, which is the lower part of the snow. Then there is a weak layer and the overlying slab. The bed surface and the slab are strong layers.\n that is, they're made out of snow that sticks to itself, the kind of snow that you can make into a snowball. The shape of the snow crystals in strong layers tends to be rounded. In contrast, the weak layer consists of snow crystals that don't readily cohere to one another,\n These tend to be more angular or faceted crystals, but there are a few different weak layer types. One of the most worrying is known as surface horror. It's not made out of snow that falls from the sky, it grows.\n rose on the surface of the snow. On cold, clear nights, the surface snow radiates a lot of its heat away, becoming even colder than the air. Since warm air holds more moisture than cold air, that moisture will crystallize at the top of the snow\n creating surface horror. Surface horror is formed by condensation. It's the snow equivalent of dew. It's really angular and it doesn't want to stick to itself. Usually surface horror is then broken down by wind.\n or sun melting it. But if a snowstorm occurs just after these crystals have formed, they can become buried. And in that case they create a very nasty weak layer, which is just perfect for avalanches. Another weak layer to\n to worry about are facets, snow crystals that used to be round but that became angular in the snowpack. Facets develop when there's a strong temperature gradient in the snow. A thermal gradient of less than 1 degree per 10cm does not produce\n Anything more than that can, which is why the temperature inside a snow pit is measured. If there's a large thermal gradient, there could also be a weak layer. Right above and right below crust there can be really wild temperature gradients. So we had\n The bottom of the snow is warmer than the top of the snow, so the warmer snow near the ground sublimates, turning straight\n from solid water into water vapor. This water vapor rises up through the snowpack and then encounters the colder snow crystals. At this point, it re-freezes and forms faceted crystals, which, like surface horror, don't stick together.\n creating a weak layer. The bigger the change in temperature, the faster the snow crystals change and the faster they change. If they change quickly, it can promote faceting, which promotes instability.\n Another important factor in slab avalanches is the stiffness of the slab. Since the snow is cohesive, when a force is applied and the interface between the slab and the weak layer starts to slip, that force, and hence the slippage, propagates. While stiffer slabs\n might resist initial triggers better, their failure leads to more propagation, leading to larger avalanches. This also results in more remote triggers. Avalanches are common after storms. The extra weight of\n snow exerts an additional load onto the snowpack, which can trigger the weak layers deeper in the snowpack to slide. The vast majority of avalanches occur during or right after a storm. In other words, the best conditions for skiing are also the best conditions\n conditions for avalanches. Strong winds also increase the risk of avalanches. The wind can pick up and transport the snow from open to more sheltered areas. As the snow accumulates, the wind pressure compacts these snow particles\n as they are deposited, which creates a dense, cohesive layer. These newly deposited layers of snow are called windslabs. Windslabs can be quite unstable, especially shortly after formation, if they've formed over a weak layer. Since\n Since they're more cohesive, these slabs can break free as large chunks during an avalanche, making them particularly hazardous. Another concern are cornices. Cornices form when the wind blows snow over the top of a ridge and it piles\n up on the other side, hanging over the edge. Cornices can weigh many tons, and when they fall onto a slope they can trigger massive slab avalanches. One of the ways that backcountry skiers test the stability of the slope they're about to ride\n So how are avalanches prevented in ski resorts? For this video, Veritasium producer Peter went out\n with the ski patrol team at Whistler Blackcomb, which is North America's largest ski resort. Dude, I'm pumped. Really pumped. Really anxious. Really stoked. Should be a good day. There are sections in ski resorts that are avalanche terrain, slopes that are greater than 30 feet.\n or so degrees, or under avalanche terrain. To keep skiers safe, before a ski area is opened, the ski patrols do avalanche control work. Fundamentally, it boils down to them triggering avalanches in a safe way before there are any skiers on\n This is done often enough so that the snow doesn't get a chance to build up too much. So the avalanches that are triggered are smaller. There are a few ways that this is done, but the most common is by using explosives.\n Explosives charges with a two-minute fuse are lit and then detonated on the slopes where they are likely to produce avalanches. Oh boy! Really glad I put on those goggles.\n Sometimes this is done by throwing the chargers out of a helicopter, but a lot of the time this is done on skis. There are even special trams where the chargers are attached to a carriage.\n and then shuttled across to a hard to access slope. As the charge detonates the shockwave breaks the weak layer leading to an avalanche.\n Despite doing the shoot the day after one of the biggest storms of the season, we weren't particularly lucky\n with getting large avalanches. We shot all morning and only got this relatively small slide. So I was getting worried. And then we were able to get this shot.\n I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this again.\n Oh my god, look at that! Avalanche control work is also\n done on roads with basically the same idea. Trigger avalanches before they get a chance to become big and destructive. For example, the Trans-Canada Highway connecting the east and west coasts of Canada goes through Rogers Pass and\n mountain pass with 3,000 meter tall peaks on either side of it. The road is right next to a mountain that's actually called Avalanche Mountain. Here Parks Canada and the Canadian Army conduct avalanche control by firing artillery\n Deaths from avalanches do occasionally\n occur in bounds at resorts, but they are very rare due to the diligent work of ski patrollers. Most avalanche injuries and deaths occur in the backcountry.\n Du h\u00f8rer s\u00e5 mye om avalanter. Det er d\u00f8dlig, og folk d\u00f8ier hver \u00e5r. Men \u00e5 faktisk f\u00f8le fordelen av avalanteret p\u00e5 kroppen din ...\n Like there's kind of nothing that can prepare you for that.\n Every time I hit the ground, I would just like dig my hands in, my feet in, like try to like claw myself down onto the ground, while also like trying to protect my head.\n I knew also like the moment the snow stopped if I was still in the snow I would be buried I wouldn't be able to move I wouldn't be you know I would be counting on my buddy to find me and dig me out\n and save me? This wasn't the huge\n This was a size 2, big enough to bury a car, but not like a house. So I was actually able to stop on the slope before it flattened out where all the snow would accumulate and that would be buried. This was like...\n But yeah, it was intense, really intense and I felt really stupid because it was the first mountain I ever skied on as a kid. It was this mountain, like this very slope and so I was just so comfortable with it and like this\n I didn't think twice about the fact that it was avalanche train and the snow. I mean, we did check the snow up top, but I don't know. I wasn't fully tuned in to the dangers that are present. Like the moment you step into avalanche train, something like that can happen.\n So the three things that you need to bring when you go backcountry skiing is a beacon, which is this thing, a probe, which is this big long stick that\n If you're buried in a slab avalanche, it's almost impossible to dig yourself out. During an avalanche, the snow gets mixed around\n and friction heats it up. So it melts a little bit, and then when the avalanche stops, it refreezes, setting like concrete. That's why if you're fully buried, you need someone else to find you and dig you out. This is\n why in 1968 the avalanche beacon was invented.\n I\n These would change from send mode to search mode and start looking for that signal.\n around 25% of avalanche fatalities are from trauma hitting a tree or a rock or being pushed off a cliff the rest are from asphyxiation if you're buried in an\n As you breathe,\n the concentration of CO2 in that bubble increases and the amount of oxygen decreases until you die from asphyxiation. If your friends find and dig you out in the first 10 minutes, you have an 80% chance of survival.\n minutes in, that chance drops to 40%. 30 minutes in, you have just a 22% chance of survival. So time is key. There is another invention that could save your life, which is an\n an avalanche airbag. If a skier triggers an avalanche, they can pull on a cord which activates the airbag. The airbag rapidly inflates. Historically this was done with compressed air, but newer versions use battery powered fans.\n The airbag increases the skier's buoyancy, making it less likely for them to be buried deeply in an avalanche. An added benefit is that if the skier is buried, as the airbag deflates, it leaves a larger air pocket, providing more time to\n be rescued. Avalanche airbags decrease the chances of death by nearly half. Around 30 people in the US die in avalanches each year, plus an additional 100 in Europe.\n Europe. Most of them are backcountry skiers, snowboarders, or snowmobilers, and they very likely triggered the avalanche that killed them. Avalanches are beautiful, majestic, and completely terrifying. If you go\n into the backcountry in winter, please carry a shovel, a probe, and a beacon. But also check the avalanche forecast and make good decisions when heading out to avalanche terrain. Because the best way to survive an avalanche is not to be caught in one.\n We know so much about avalanches today thanks to people like Bruce. People who followed their curiosity and learned\n and through discovery. But thankfully, you don't have to go into avalanche terrain to experience this kind of learning.

            "transcription": "This video was sponsored by KiwiCo. More about KiwiCo at the end of the show.\n We are so sure of it that since 1983 we've actually used the speed of light to define how long a meter is. It's just the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1 over 299,792,458.\n That definition ensures that the speed of light is exactly this number, no decimals. But hear me out. In this video, I will prove to you that light may never actually travel at this speed.\n this speed. And I can say that because no one has actually measured it. We can't measure the speed of light the same way we measure the speed of anything else.\n I think we're recording everywhere. What are we doing? This is a video about measuring the speed of stuff. Okay. Tell me about how you measured the speed of the baseball fired out of your cannon. Well to get the speed of the baseball you need to know\n two things. You need to know the distance between two points and you need to know the time that it takes the baseball to travel between those points. So basically we took distance divided by time and that's the speed of the baseball. And in our case we were shooting with a high-speed camera so you basically\n just count the frames and then your clock is internal. Oh you're going relativity. You're gonna do something weird aren't you? You saw it coming. I can't believe it. The thing I want to ask you about is the speed of light. Okay. Could you measure the speed of light?\n Imagine you have a laser that can fire a beam through a perfect vacuum for one kilometer. Start a timer the instant you fire the laser beam, and then exactly when it hits the end, stop the clock.\n Except how do you know when light reaches 1 kilometer if you and the clock are at the starting point? Okay, so you need two clocks, one at the laser and one at the end, which stops automatically when it detects the laser light.\n light. But now, how do you make sure your two clocks are synchronized? Well, you could connect them via a wire and send a pulse from one to the other, but that pulse will travel at the speed of light, so it will arrive with a time delay. You might\n think you can just subtract that time delay but is equal to the time it takes for light to travel one kilometer. That's what we don't know and are trying to measure. Okay, new plan. Start with the clocks together and sync them up for\n first, and then send one of the clocks down to the end. Now, what could possibly go wrong? Well, I'll tell you. The clock at the finish line was moving with respect to the one at the start, and special relativity tells us moving clocks tick slow relatively\n to stationary observers. So by the time the clock reaches 1 kilometer, it will no longer be in sync with the clock at the start. Can I tell you the only solution to this problem? Ditch the second clock. Put a mirror at the end to\n reflect the light back and use a single clock at the start to time the full 2km round trip.\n wanted to do this. So that sounds a little like how the speed of light was first experimentally measured by Ippolite Fizeau in 1849. He shone a beam of light between the teeth of a rapidly spinning gear to a mirror up on a hill\n hill 8 kilometers away. And then by increasing the speed of the gear, he reached a point where the reflected light passed through the next gap on the gear, and so it was observed. So he measured the speed of light to be 313,000 kilometers per second,\n is within 5% of the presently accepted value. So someone has measured the speed of light. Or have they? What has been measured is the round trip or two-way speed of light. But no one has measured the\n one way speed of light.\n like a Veritasium video.\n in just one direction. It's possible that the speed of light is half of c in one direction and then instantaneous on the return journey. What? That's possible. Are you serious? Think about communicating with an astronaut stranded on\n Mars. Let's call him Mark. We send out a signal and get a response 20 minutes later. So we imagine our signal takes 10 minutes to get there and the reply takes 10 minutes to come back. But it's\n It's possible that our message took all 20 minutes to get there and the reply came back instantaneously. There's no way we could tell the difference between these two scenarios. But why would the speed of light be different?\n Well, it's possible that there is some preferred direction through space-time. I mean, our universe has a lot of symmetries, but there is also some asymmetry. For example, why is there so much matter relative to antimatter?\n And physicists have worked out internally consistent theories of physics in which the speed of light is different forwards and in reverse. The speed of light could vary by just a few percent, up to at the extreme going C over 2 in one direction,\n infinitely fast in the other direction. Okay so let me let me figure this out so yeah I I kind of don't believe you I kind of don't believe you I don't believe you that light is a different speed in one direction but in the other\n But I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't you wouldn't call me and put a camera on me Unless you knew you were right and that's what scares me about this Now you might think it is\n just simpler, that light should travel at the same speed in all directions, but the truth is that is a convention rather than an experimentally verified fact. Einstein himself pointed this out in his famous\n 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. He spends the first couple of pages on the problem of synchronizing clocks at different locations A and B. And he says there is no way that we can meaningfully compare the times they measure\n He's essentially defining that the speed of light in opposite directions is the same.\n And he puts, by definition, in italics to remind us that this is only a convention. It's known as the Einstein synchronization convention. So the idea that the speed of light is the same in opposite directions, as Einstein would later write, is\n That sounds a lot more subjective than how I think\n most people would imagine the speed of light is defined.\n light. There's no way to define the one-way speed of light. So the only thing we can really define is the two-way speed of light. Just look at the way Einstein defines C. It's for the round trip from A to B and back. I don't know if you saw in your physics classes, but whenever there was a light\n clock, it would always bounce the light up and then back. You would never see a light clock just bounce light one way. And this is why. The only thing we can be certain is constant for all inertial observers is the two-way speed of light.\n For over a hundred years, scientists have tried to find a way around this, to measure the one-way speed of light by itself. Here is a paper published in the American Journal of Physics in 2009 that claims to measure the one-way speed of light.\n is the paper debunking this study pointing out that these authors were actually measuring the two-way speed of light. But I'm imagining you might have some ideas for how to measure the one-way speed of light, so let's go through some of them. I mean, can't we just use a high-speed camera\n that shoots at a trillion frames a second so we can actually see light passing through an object? The problem is, you're not only seeing the light pass through the object, you're also seeing it bounce back to the camera, measuring the two-way speed, not one way.\n There you go. Get a spool of fiber optic cable, you know, I don't know, like 186,000 miles, and then you can shine the light here and you have the other end of the fiber here and you can shine here and then wait and see the delay, see if it's one second later\n The thing is, that fiber is going around and around and around, so it could be that when the light goes this way over the top of the loop, it goes slower, and then when it goes on the bottom, it goes faster. It all averages out in the fiber, and you're essentially getting lots of\n round trips in that fiber, so you're never getting a one-way. What if you center a synchronizing device between your two clocks and send out simultaneous pulses? Well, if the speed of light is the same in both directions, this perfectly synchronizes your clocks.\n But if the speed of light is different in each direction, one of the clocks will be ahead of the other, and it will be ahead by just the right amount so that when you measure the speed of light, you will find the value to be c, even though that was not the speed\n the light was traveling. This is the same reason GPS synchronized clocks won't work. The whole GPS system is based on the assumption that the speed of light is the same in all directions. If the speed of light is different in different directions, the light pulses from\n satellites will travel at different speeds so the clocks won't be properly synced. By that I mean they will always measure c for the one-way speed of light whether it is or isn't. How about starting with synchronized clocks in\n the middle and moving them apart with equal and opposite speeds. That way the time dilation for each clock will be the same and they'll still be synchronized when they reach the endpoints. But again, this only works if the speed of light in each direction\n is the same. If the speed of light depends on direction, then so does time dilation. You might think you could move the clocks really, really slowly so that time dilation is negligible, but if the speed of light is different in different directions,\n So you can't just use the standard formula to calculate what that time dilation would be. I mean, it could be a lot worse than you think. So the reality is we're stuck. We need synchronized clocks to measure the one-way speed of light, but we need to know the one-way speed of light\n in order to synchronize our clocks. Now this might sound like just an academic concern, so I want to go through an example to illustrate just how differently the universe works if the speed of light is not the same in all directions. Let's say on Mars,\n Mark is trying to synchronize his clock with the Earth. At noon, Mission Control sends out a message that says, this signal was sent at exactly 12 o'clock. When Mark receives this message, he uses the Einstein synchronization convention to set his clock.\n He knows the round-trip time delay is 20 minutes, so he assumes the signal must have taken 10 minutes to reach him. He programs his clock to 12.10 p.m. and sends a return message. This reply sent to 12.10.\n The message is received on Earth at 1220pm, so both parties know the synchronization was successful. When the clock reads 1220 on Earth, it simultaneously reads 1220 on Mars. But now consider what happens if the speed of light is not the same.\n in both directions. Let's say it is C over 2 from Earth to Mars, and then instantaneous from Mars back to Earth. No one knows this of course, so they continue to use the Einstein convention. The message is sent from Earth,\n But now it takes a full 20 minutes to reach Mars. But Mark doesn't know this. And as before, he assumes the signal took 10 minutes to reach him, so he sets his clock to 1210pm, even though on Earth it is now 1220. Mark then sends the\n This reply sent at 1210pm, which is instantaneously received on Earth at 1220 EARTH TIME. The experience for the two communicators is the same. The same messages were received with the same local time delay.\n days, but their clocks are out of sync by 10 minutes. What they think is the same moment for the other observer actually isn't, and there is no way they can ever recognize or correct this error. Imagine if someone on Earth immediately\n The message would take 20 minutes to reach Mars, but due to the clocks being out of sync, it would arrive at 1230 Mars time, so Mark would reply 10 minutes, a message that would hit Mars.\n instantaneously reach the Earth at 1240 ET. The space-time diagram shows how there is flexibility in what you consider to be the same moment at two different locations, and in how you define\n the one-way speed of light. Einstein chose the convention where the one-way speed of light is always the same, but from an experimental perspective, any other convention is just as valid, up to and including one where the speed of light is c over 2 one-way\n and instantaneous the other way. And in that case, it's interesting to think about what each observer is seeing when they look at the other. Mark would be seeing the Earth as it was 20 minutes ago, but Earth is seeing\n Mars in real time, exactly as it is right now. And this effect wouldn't stop at Mars. Look beyond it and you could see stars hundreds of light years away. Not as they looked centuries ago, but\n exactly as they are right this instant.\n So an instantaneous interpretation of that light is just as good as one where it takes C to reach us. This is breaking my brain. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's kind of unknowable, isn't it? It is unknowable. That's the whole point of the video is to say,\n we've all agreed, and this is based on something Einstein wrote in 1905, we've all agreed to just say it's C in every direction, but the truth is the physics works the same whether it's C or the C over 2 in instantaneous or anything in between. As long as\n If the round trip works out to be C, none of physics breaks. And that's the crazy thing. So if we can never measure the one-way speed of light, and if it makes no difference to any of the laws of physics, then what's the point in even talking about it?\n Well, that is certainly one valid perspective in a debate that has been ongoing since 1905. Some physicists appeal to Occam's razor. Isn't it just simpler if light travels at the same speed in all directions? Most working physicists just\n accept the convention and move on with their lives. But I think it's important to point out that it is just a convention, not an empirically verified fact. Personally, I find it\n fascinating that this is something about the universe that is hidden from us. Sure, the round trip speed of light is c, but does the one-way speed even have a well-defined value? And if it doesn't, what does that mean for the concept of simultaneous\n When is right now on Mars? Does it even make sense to talk about things happening at the same time if they're separated by distance? You know, maybe this is an odd quirk of the universe and there's no good reason for it.\n Or maybe, when physics takes the next paradigmatic leap, our inability to measure the one-way speed of light will be the obvious clue to the way general relativity, quantum mechanics, space and time\n are all connected, and we'll wonder why we didn't see it before.\n to get kids making.

From the beginning of the universe, through\n its entire evolution to its inevitable end. It may in fact determine the direction of time and even be the reason that life exists. To see the confusion around this topic, you need ask only one simple\n question. What does the earth get from the Sun? What does the earth get from Sun? Well, it's light rays. What do we get from the sun? Heat. Warp. Warp, light.\n Vitamin D, we get vitamin D from the ultraviolet rays. Well, a lot of energy. What does the Earth get from this energy? Yeah, energy. Energy. Nailed it. Every day the Earth gets a certain amount of energy from the sun.\n and then how much energy does the earth radiate back into space relative to that amount that it gets from the Sun? Probably not as much. I don't believe it. It's just radiating right back. I'd say less. Less.\n I'd say less. I'd guess about 70%. It is a fraction. I'd say 20%. Because we use some of it. We use some of the energy. We consume a lot, right? But the thing about energy is it never really goes away. You can't really use it up.\n It would have to break even, wouldn't it? Same amount, yeah. You know, cause and effect, it'd be equal in some ways, right? For most of the Earth's history, it should be exactly the same amount of energy in from the Sun as Earth radiates into space.\n Wow. Because if we didn't do that, then the earth would get a lot hotter. That'd be a problem. That'd be a big problem. So if that is the case, then what are we really getting from the sun? That's a good question.\n It gives us a nice tan. It gives us a nice tan. I love it. We're getting something special from the sun. I don't know. What do we get without the energy? But nobody talks about it. To answer that, we have to go back to a discovery made two centuries ago.\n In the winter of 1813, France was being invaded by the armies of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. The son of one of Napoleon's generals was Sadi Carnot, a 17-year-old student. On December 29th, he writes a letter to Napoleon\n to request to join in the fight. Napoleon, preoccupied in battle, never replies. But Carnot gets his wish a few months later when Paris is attacked. The students defend a chateau just east of the city. But this\n They are no match for the advancing armies and Paris falls after only a day of fighting. Forced to retreat, Carnot is devastated. Seven years later, he goes to visit his father who's fled to Prussia.\n after Napoleon's downfall. His father was not only a general, but also a physicist. He wrote an essay on how energy is most efficiently transferred in mechanical systems. When his son comes to visit, they talk at length about the big\n breakthrough of the time, steam engines. Steam engines were already being used to power ships, mine ore, and excavate ports. And it was clear that the future industrial and military might of nations depended on having\n having the best steam engines. But French designs were falling behind those of other countries, like Britain. So, Sadi Carnot took it upon himself to figure out why.\n At the time, even the best steam engines only converted around 3% of thermal energy into useful mechanical work. If he could improve on that, he could give France a huge advantage and restore its place in the world.\n He spends the next three years studying heat engines. And one of his key insights involves how an ideal heat engine would work, one with no friction and no losses to the environment. It looks something like this.\n Take two really big metal bars, one hot and one cold. The engine consists of a chamber filled with air, where heat can only flow in or out through the bottom. Inside the chamber is a piston.\n which is connected to a flywheel. The air starts at a temperature just below that of the hot bar. So first the hot bar is brought into contact with the chamber. The air inside expands with heat flowing into it to maintain its temperature. This\n pushes the piston up, turning the flywheel. Next, the hot bar is removed, but the air in the chamber continues to expand. Except now, without heat entering, the temperature decreases, in the ideal case, until it is the\n temperature of the cold bar. The cold bar is brought into contact with the chamber and the flywheel pushes the piston down, and as the air is compressed, heat is transferred into the cold bar. The cold bar is removed, the flywheel compresses the gas further,\n increasing its temperature until it is just below that of the hot bar. Then the hot bar is connected again and the cycle repeats. Through this process, heat from the hot bar is converted into the energy of the flywheel.\n And what's interesting to note about Carnot's ideal engine is that it is completely reversible. If you ran the engine in reverse, first the air expands, lowering the temperature, then the chamber is brought into contact with the cold bar, the\n The air expands more, drawing in heat from the cold bar. Next, the air is compressed, increasing its temperature. The chamber is placed on top of the hot bar, and the energy of the flywheel is used to return the heat back into the hot bar.\n However many cycles were run in the forward direction, you could run the same number in reverse, and at the end, everything would return to its original state, with no additional input of energy required.\n So what is the efficiency of this engine? Since it's fully reversible, you might expect the efficiency to be 100%.\n But that is not the case. Each cycle, the energy of the flywheel increases by the amount of heat flowing into the chamber from the hot bar minus the heat flowing out of the chamber at the cold bar. So to calculate the efficiency, we divide\n Divide this energy by the heat input from the hot bar. Now the heat in on the hot side is equal to the work done by the gas on the piston and this will always be greater than the work done by the piston on the gas on\n the cold side, which equals the heat out. And this is because on the hot side, the hot gas exerts a greater pressure on the piston than that same gas when cold. To increase the efficiency of the engine, you could increase the temperature\n Lord Kelvin learns of Carnot's ideal heat engine and realizes it could form the basis for an absolute temperature scale.\n Imagine that the gas is allowed to expand an extreme amount, so much that it cools to the point where all the gas particles effectively stop moving. Then they would exert no pressure on the piston, and it would take no work to compress it on\n the cold side, so no heat would be lost. This is the idea of absolute zero, and it would make for a 100% efficient engine. Using this absolute temperature scale, the Kelvin scale,\n we can replace the amount of heat in and out with the temperature of the hot and cold side respectively because they are directly proportional. So we can express efficiency like this which we can rewrite like this.\n What we have learned is that the efficiency of an ideal heat engine doesn't depend on the materials or the design of the engine, but fundamentally on the temperatures of the hot and cold sides. To reach 100% efficiency you'd need infinite temperature on the hot side,\n or absolute zero on the cold side, both of which are impossible in practice. So even with no friction or losses to the environment, it's impossible to make a heat engine 100% efficient. And that's because to return the piston to its original position, you need\n to dump heat into the cold bar so not all the energy stays in the flywheel. Now in Carnot's time, high pressure steam engines could only reach temperatures up to 160 degrees Celsius, so their theoretical maximum efficiency\n was 32%, but their real efficiency was more like 3%. That's because real engines experience friction, dissipate heat to the environment, and they don't transfer heat at constant temperatures. So for just as much heat going\n When energy spreads out like this, it is impossible\n to get it back. So this process is irreversible. The total amount of energy didn't change, but it became less usable. Energy is most usable when it is concentrated, and less usable when it's spread\n out. Decades later, German physicist Rudolf Clausius studies Carnot's engine and he comes up with a way to measure how spread out the energy is. He calls this quantity\n entropy. When all the energy is concentrated in the hot bar, that is low entropy. But as the energy spreads to the surroundings, the walls of the chamber and the axle, well, entropy increases.\n This means the same amount of energy is present, but in this more dispersed form, it is less available to do work. In 1865, Clausius summarizes the first two laws of thermodynamics like this.\n First, the energy of the universe is constant, and second, the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum. In other words, energy spreads out over time.\n The second law is core to so many phenomena in the world. It's why hot things cool down and cool things heat up, why gas expands to fill a container, why you can't have a perpetual motion machine because the amount of usable energy in a closed\n The most common way to describe entropy is as disorder, which makes sense because it is associated with things becoming more mixed, random, and less ordered, but I think the best way to\n think about entropy is as the tendency of energy to spread out. So why does energy spread out over time? I mean most of the laws of physics work exactly the same way forwards or backwards in time. So how does this clear\n time dependence arise? Well, let's consider two small metal bars, one hot and one cold. For this simple model, we'll consider only 8 atoms per bar. Each atom vibrates according to the number\n of energy packets it has. The more packets, the more it vibrates. So let's start with seven packets of energy in the left bar and three in the right. The number of energy packets in each bar is what we'll call a state. First, let's consider just\n the left bar. It has seven energy packets which are free to move around the lattice. This happens non-stop. The energy packets hop randomly from atom to atom, giving different configurations of energy. But the total energy stays the same the whole time.\n Now let's bring the cold bar back in with only three packets and touch them together. The energy packets can now hop around between both bars creating different configurations. Each unique configuration is equally likely.\n So what happens if we take a snapshot at one instant in time and see where all the energy packets are? So stop. Look at this. Now there are nine energy packets in the left bar and only one in the right bar.\n So, heat has flowed from cold to hot. Shouldn't that be impossible because it decreases entropy? Well, this is where Ludwig Boltzmann made an important insight. Heat flowing from cold to hot is\n not impossible, it's just improbable. There are 91,520 configurations with 9 energy packets in the left bar, but 627,264 with 5 energy\n energy packets in each bar. That is, the energy is more than 6 times as likely to be evenly spread between the bars. But if you add up all the possibilities, you find there's still a 10.5% chance that the left bar ends up with more energy\n packets than it started. So why don't we observe this happening around us? Well watch what happens as we increase the number of atoms to 80 per bar and the energy packets to 100 with 70 in the left bar and 30 in the right.\n There is now only a 0.05% chance that the left solid ends up hotter than it started. And this trend continues as we keep scaling up the system. In everyday solids there are around 100 trillion trillion atoms\n and even more energy packets. So heat flowing from cold to hot is just so unlikely that it never happens. Think of it like this Rubik's Cube. Right now it is completely solved, but I'm gonna\n close my eyes and make some turns at random. If I keep doing this, it will get further and further from being solved. But how can I be confident that I'm really messing this cube up? Well, because there's only one way for it to be solved.\n a few ways for it to be almost solved, and quintillions of ways for it to be almost entirely random. Without thought and effort, every turn moves the Rubik's Cube from a highly unlikely state, that of it being solved, to a more likely\n So if the natural tendency of energy is to spread out and for things to get messier, then how is it possible to have something like air conditioning? Where the cold\n cold interior of a house gets cooler and the hot exterior gets hotter. Energy is going from cold to hot, decreasing the entropy of the house. Well, this decrease in entropy is\n only possible by increasing the entropy a greater amount somewhere else. In this case, at a power plant, the concentrated chemical energy in coal is being released, heating up the power plant and its environment, spreading to the turbine\n the electric generators, heating the wires all the way to the house, and producing waste heat in the fans and compressor. Whatever decrease in entropy is achieved at the house is more than paid for by an increase in entropy required to\n make that happen. But if total entropy is constantly increasing, and anything we do only accelerates that increase, then how is there any structure left on Earth? How are their hot parts\n Well, if the Earth were a closed system, the energy would spread out completely, meaning all life would cease, everything would decay and mix, and eventually\n eventually reach the same temperature. But luckily, Earth is not a closed system, because we have the Sun. What the Sun really gives us is a\n The steady stream of low entropy that is concentrated, bundled up energy. Plants,\n this energy and use it to grow and create sugars, then animals eat plants and use that energy to maintain their bodies and move around. Bigger animals get their energy by eating smaller animals and so on, and each step of the\n way, the energy becomes more spread out. Ultimately, all the energy that reaches Earth from the sun is converted into thermal energy, and then it's radiated\n back into space. The increase in entropy can be seen in the\n relative number of photons arriving at and leaving the Earth. For each photon received from the Sun, 20 photons are emitted. And everything that happens on Earth, plants growing, trees falling,\n Herds, stampeding, hurricanes and tornadoes, people eating, sleeping and breathing, all of it happens in the process of converting fewer, higher energy photons into 20 times as many lower energy photons.\n Without a source of concentrated energy and a way to discard the spread out energy, life on earth would not be possible. It has even been suggested that life itself may be a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.\n thermodynamics. If the universe tends toward maximum entropy, then life offers a way to accelerate that natural tendency, because life is spectacularly good at converting low entropy into high entropy.\n For example, the surface layer of seawater produces between 30 to 680% more entropy when cyanobacteria and other organic matter is present than when it's not. Jeremy England takes this one step further.\n He's proposed that if there is a constant stream of clumped up energy, this could favor structures that dissipate that energy. And over time, this results in better and better energy dissipators eventually resulting in life.\n Or, in his own words, you start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant. So, life on Earth survives on the low entropy from the sun.\n But then, where did the sun get its low entropy? The answer is the universe. If we know that the total entropy of the universe is increasing with time, then it was lower entropy yesterday, and even\n even lower entropy the day before that, and so on all the way back to the Big Bang. So right after the Big Bang, that is when the entropy was lowest. This is known as the past hypothesis.\n It doesn't explain why the entropy was low, just that it must have been that way for the universe to unfold as it has. But the early universe was hot, dense, and almost completely uniform. I mean, everything was mixed and the temperature was basically\n the same everywhere, varying by at most 0.001%. So how is this low entropy? Well, the thing we've left out is gravity. Gravity tends to clump matter together.\n So taking gravity into account, having matter all spread out like this would be an extremely unlikely state, and that is why it's low entropy. Over time, as the universe expanded and cooled,\n started to clump together in more dense regions, and in doing so, enormous amounts of potential energy were turned into kinetic energy. And this energy could also be used, like how water flowing downhill can power a turbine.\n But as bits of matter started hitting each other, some of their kinetic energy was converted into heat, so the amount of useful energy decreased, thereby increasing entropy. Over time, the useful energy\n The universe started with around 10 to the 88 Boltzmann constants worth of entropy.\n Nowadays, all the stars in the observable universe have about 9.5 times 10 to the 80. The interstellar and intergalactic medium combined have almost 10 times more, but still only a fraction of the early universe.\n More is contained in neutrinos and in photons of the cosmic microwave background. In 1972, Jacob Bekenstein proposed another source of entropy, black holes.\n He suggested that the entropy of a black hole should be proportional to its surface area. So as a black hole grows, its entropy increases. Famous physicists thought the idea was nonsense, and for good reason.\n According to classical thermodynamics, if black holes have entropy, then they should also have a temperature. But if they have temperatures, they should emit radiation and not be black after all. The person who set out to prove Bekenstein wrong\n wrong, was Stephen Hawking. But to his surprise, his results showed that black holes do emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation, and they do have a temperature. The black hole at the center of the Milky Way has a temperature\n of about a hundred trillionth of a Kelvin, emitting radiation that is far too weak to detect, so still pretty black. But Hawking confirmed that black holes have entropy, and Bekenstein was right. Hawking was able to refine Bekenstein's\n Einstein's proposal and determine just how much entropy they have. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way has about 10 to the 91 Boltzmann constants of entropy. That is a thousand times as much as the early observable universe.\n and 10 times more than all the other particles combined. And that is just one black hole. All black holes together account for 3 times 10 to the 104 Boltzmann constants worth of entropy.\n Almost all the entropy of the universe is tied up in black holes. That means the early universe only had about 0.0000000000003% of the entropy it has now.\n So the entropy was low and everything that happens in the universe like planetary systems forming, galaxies merging, asteroids crashing, stars dying to life itself flourishing, all of that can happen\n because the entropy of the universe was low and it has been increasing. And it all happens only in one direction. We never see an asteroid uncrash or a planetary system unmix into the cloud of dust and gas that made it up.\n There is a clear difference between going to the past and the future, and that difference comes from entropy. The fact that we are going from unlikely to more likely states is why there is an arrow of time.\n This is expected to continue until, eventually, the energy gets spread out so completely that nothing interesting will ever happen again. This is the heat death of the universe.\n In the distant future, more than 10 to the 100 years from now, after the last black hole has evaporated, the universe will be in its most probable state. Now, even on large scales, you would not be able to tell the difference between time moving forward\n So it sounds like entropy is this awful thing that leads us inevitably towards the dullest outcome imaginable.\n But just because maximum entropy has low complexity does not mean that low entropy has maximum complexity. It's actually more like this tea and milk. I mean holding it like this is not very interesting. But as I pour the milk in, the\n The two start to mix and these beautiful patterns emerge. They arise in an instant and before you know it, they're gone, back to being featureless. Both low and high entropy are low in complexity.\n It's in the middle where complex structures appear and thrive. And since that's where we find ourselves, let's make use of the low entropy we've got while we can.\n With the right tools, we can understand just about anything, from a cup of tea cooling down to the evolution of the entire universe.

            "transcription": "So recently, a friend of mine says to me, Derek, you know your heaviest at night before you go to bed and lightest in the morning when you wake up? Okay, but that doesn't really seem to make sense. Of course it does. Overnight you're not eating anything for like eight hours.\n But you're still burning calories. So of course you'll be lightest in the morning. Yeah, but where's the mass going? Like how are you actually losing particles? You can't argue with me. I've weighed myself at night and the next morning and I know it's true. Is that after you went to the toilet?\n No, I told you that has nothing to do with it. Why do you have to disagree with everything that anyone says? You just like arguing. It's not that I like arguing, it's just that your statement seems implausible. I need some kind of mechanism that would explain how you could be heaviest at night\n and then lightest by the morning. Why don't you Google it? Okay, so I Googled it and the results were a little bit disturbing. I'll be three to five pounds heavier during the nighttime hours and when I wake up the next morning I'm back\n down five pounds less. I usually wear myself in the morning. I'm anywhere from three to five pounds lighter. Odd. An empty body weighs less than a full one. The force of gravity also can weigh a person down.\n Really? Internet? This is what we're coming to? But these are just people posting on forums. Maybe people out on the street are different. So I'm gonna go find some people in Perth and see what they say.\n What time of day do you weigh the most? What do you reckon? I suppose evening time when we've eaten too much. Night time? Yeah, night time. Night time. Just before you go to bed. Yeah, I'd say that as well.\n lightest in the morning when you wake up. Well you lightest when you first get out of bed so obviously if you keep on eating and drinking during the day. I can prove it because I'm one of these sort of people that weigh myself, I weigh myself every single morning of my life and I'm always lightest in the morning.\n Of course the best way to settle this is with an experiment. So every night before I go to bed I will weigh myself. And in the morning, before I go to the bathroom,\n I will weigh myself again. Now in any scientific experiment, it's pretty important to control your variables. So every time I go for my weigh-in, I'm wearing these exact clothes. I know, pretty snazzy, right?\n The hotel staff here have graciously allowed me to use their scale, but they told me I can't take it to my room, so I need to do the weigh-ins at the concierge. I'm going down for my first weigh-in Sunday night. We'll see what my weight is right now.\n now at 1 17 a.m. all right so 72.1\n zero kilos. Where does the mass go while you're sleeping? Like how do you lose weight while you're sleeping? I think it evaporates. She sweats a lot. I consider digesting it all.\n it's kind of probably compressed and out. But that's true! Where does it go? Burning it, using it up, whatever. Burning carbohydrates. Okay, so where does the matter actually go? Where does the weight actually go?\n transferred as energy that your body uses as, you know like science stuff, like ATP. Are you saying that we're converting matter into energy? Yes, that's one way of getting rid of it. Is that what's happening? It uses up the matter? Yeah.\n So your matter is just disappearing from inside you? That's my question. Everything you put into you doesn't all come out the other end as well. So your body uses certain parts of it to sustain you and let you live.\n It's Monday morning. I've just gone up. I need to go to the bathroom. So before I do that, I'm gonna go down for my weigh-in.\n Hello? Last night I weighed 72.1 kilograms. Let's see what I weigh in the morning. 71.9... say 925.\n kilograms. I'm not really surprised. My mass has only changed by about 150 grams. It doesn't really surprise me, but yeah, I don't think it's backing up my friend's theory. So we'll have to do this a few more times to make sure that\n that these results are valid. The difference of about .25 kilos, 250 grams, 72.05 kilograms.\n That's a loss of about 300 grams. So it looks like every night you lose about 250 grams, which is pretty similar to the amount that I've been losing every day this week.\n How do you actually lose weight as you sleep? Every night this week I seem to lose about 250 grams. I think about 150 grams of that was water loss through sweating and breathing out water vapor. So where's the other 100 grams?\n going. Well every time you breathe in you're breathing about 500 milliliters of air but only about a fifth of that is oxygen. Now three-quarters of that oxygen you'll just breathe out again but one-quarter of it is\n gets replaced with carbon dioxide. Now carbon dioxide compared to oxygen has the extra mass of carbon on every molecule and the mass of carbon released in every breath is about a hundredth of a gram. I know that doesn't\n sound like a lot, but if you add it up, 16 breaths a minute over 8 hours, it adds up to about 100 grams. Every time you breathe out, you're losing weight. Because...\n I don't know, people don't talk about it, people don't think about it.\n are still there, the matter is still there, you need to get rid of it somehow. And some of it is breathed out. So people were right when they said that you are burning calories and that's causing you to become lighter. They just\n think about the exhaust, the water vapor and the carbon dioxide that you breathe out. So it may be the case that you're heaviest at night and lightest in the morning, but I think the real truth of the matter is you're heaviest after your biggest meal and lightest after you've gone to\n the bathroom. It's after lunch on Thursday, so let's see what difference a big meal makes. I was 71.1 kg, I'm now 72.5 kg.\n 5 nearly added a kilo and a half my lunch was nearly a kilo and a half so this morning when I woke up I was 72.1 kilograms but now I've gone to the bathroom so I'd like to see what difference that makes\n 70.6 kilograms. That is a lot of mass that I've lost. What is that like?\n 1.5 kilos? 1.5 kilos. That's a lot of mass."

            "transcription": "Nearly 350 years ago, Isaac Newton came up with three laws of motion that govern how everything moves. They're three pretty famous laws of motion.\n And they're not very complicated, but if I told them to you as clearly as I can, you would think that you're understanding them, but I think you wouldn't. And the reason is, everyone has ideas about\n physics and about how objects move before they're ever taught anything in a science classroom. So rather than tell you Newton's three laws of motion, I would like to tell you Derek's three incorrect laws of motion, which are the ones\n I think you're actually thinking. So Derek's first incorrect law of motion is an object with no unbalanced forces acting on it will naturally\n come to rest. Derek's second incorrect answer.\n law of motion is that an unbalanced force causes an object to move with a constant velocity. We could express this in an equation where the unbalanced force F equals the mass of\n m times the velocity v. So if you double the force, the velocity also doubles. It's just like being in a car. As you press on the accelerator, you increase the force on the car and therefore\n you move to a new, higher constant speed. Derrick's third incorrect law of motion is that larger objects apply larger forces to smaller objects. When a large truck\n slams into a car on a highway, the force of the truck on the car is much greater than the force of the car back on the truck. Or, if you think about the Earth and the Moon, the force with which the Earth attracts\n the moon is greater than the force with which the moon attracts the earth. But remember, this is an incorrect law of motion."

            "transcription": "Picture this, you wake up one morning and you feel a little bit sick. No particular symptoms, just not 100%. And so you go to the doctor and she also doesn't know what's going on with you so she suggests they run a battery of tests. And after a week goes by\n by\n And she says, well, the test will correctly identify 99% of people that have the disease and only incorrectly identify 1% of people who don't have the disease. So that sounds pretty bad. I mean, what are the chances that you actually\n have this disease. I think most people would say 99% because that's the accuracy of the test. But that is not actually correct. You need Bayes' theorem to get some perspective.\n Bayes' theorem can give you the probability that some hypothesis, say that you actually have the disease, is true\n given an event that you tested positive for the disease. To calculate this, you need to take the prior probability the hypothesis was true, that is, how likely you thought it was that you had this disease before you got the test results, and multiply it by the probability of the event given the hypothesis.\n This term is a combination of your probability of having the disease and correctly testing positive, plus\n your probability of not having the disease and being falsely identified. The prior probability that a hypothesis is true is often the hardest part of this equation to figure out, and sometimes it's no better than a guess, but in this case a reasonable starting point is the frequency\n of the disease in the population, so 0.1%. And if you plug in the rest of the numbers, you find that you have a 9% chance of actually having the disease after testing positive. Which is incredibly low if you think about it. Now this isn't some\n of crazy magic. It's actually common sense applied to mathematics. Just think about a sample size of a thousand people. Now one person out of that thousand is likely to actually have the disease and the test would likely identify them correctly as having\n the disease. But out of the 999 other people, 1% or 10 people would falsely be identified as having the disease. So if you're one of those people who has a positive test result and everyone's just selected at random, well you're actually part\n of a group of 11 where only one person has the disease so your chances of actually having it are 1 in 11. 9%. It just makes sense. When Bayes first came up with this theorem he didn't actually think it was revolutionary.\n He didn't even think it was worthy of publication. He didn't submit it to the Royal Society, of which he was a member, and in fact it was discovered in his papers after he died and he had abandoned it for more than a decade. His relatives asked his friend\n Richard Price to dig through his papers and see if there was anything worth publishing in there. And that's where Price discovered what we now know as the origins of Bayes' theorem. Bayes originally considered a thought experiment, where he was sitting with his back to a perfectly flat, perfectly\n square table and then he would ask an assistant to throw a ball onto the table. Now this ball could obviously land and end up anywhere on the table and he wanted to figure out where it was. So what he'd ask his assistant to do was throw on another ball and then\n tell him if it landed to the left or to the right or in front behind of the first ball. And he would note that down and then ask for more and more balls to be thrown on the table. What he realized was that through this method he could keep\n keep updating his idea of where the first ball was. Now of course he would never be completely certain, but with each new piece of evidence, he would get more and more accurate. And that's how Bayes saw the world. It wasn't that he thought the world\n was not determined that reality didn't quite exist but it was that we couldn't know it perfectly and all we could hope to do was update our understanding as more and more evidence became available. When Richard Price\n introduced Bayes' theorem. He made an analogy to a man coming out of a cave. Maybe he'd lived his whole life in there and he saw the sunrise for the first time and kind of thought to himself, is this a one-off? Is this a quirk? Or does the sun\n always do this. And then every day after that, as the sun rose again, he could get a little bit more confident that, well, that was the way the world works. So Bayes' theorem wasn't really a formula intended to be used just once.\n was intended to be used multiple times, each time gaining new evidence and updating your probability that something is true. So if we go back to the first example when you tested positive for a disease, what would happen if you went to another doctor, get a second\n opinion and get that test run again, but let's say by a different lab just to be sure that those tests are independent. And let's say that test also comes back as positive. Now what is the probability that you actually have the disease? Well you can use Bayes formula again.\n except this time for your prior probability that you have the disease you have to put in the posterior probability the probability that we worked out before which is 9% because you've already had one positive test and if you crunch those numbers the new probability\n based on two positive tests is 91%. There's a 91% chance that you actually have the disease, which kind of makes sense. Two positive results by different labs are unlikely to just be chance, but you'll notice that probability is still\n not as high as the accuracy, the reported accuracy of the test. Bayes' theorem has found a number of practical applications, including notably filtering your spam. You know, traditional spam filters actually do a kind of bad job. There's too many\n false positives, too much of your email ends up in spam. But using a Bayesian filter, you can look at the various words that appear in emails and use Bayes' theorem to give a probability that the email is spam, given that those words appear.\n Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our beliefs in light of new evidence, but it can't tell us how to set our prior beliefs. So it's possible for some people to hold that certain things are true with 100% certainty, and other people to hold those same things\n are true with 0% certainty. What Bayes' theorem shows us is that in those cases, there is absolutely no evidence, nothing anyone could do, to change their minds. And so as Nate Silver points out in his book, The Signal and the Noise,\n We should probably not have debates between people with 100% prior certainty and 0% prior certainty because, well, really, they'll never convince each other of anything. Most of the time when people talk about Bayes' theorem, they discuss how calculus\n intuitive it is and how we don't really have an inbuilt sense of it. But recently my concern has been the opposite, that maybe we're too good at internalizing the thinking behind Bayes' theorem. And the reason I'm worried about that is because\n I think in life we can get used to particular circumstances, we can get used to results, maybe getting rejected or failing at something or getting paid a low wage, and we can internalize that as though we are that man emerging from\n the cave and we see the sunrise every day and every day and we keep updating our beliefs to a point of near certainty that we think that that is basically the way that nature is it's the way the world is and there's nothing that we can do to\n change it. You know, there's Nelson Mandela's quote that everything is impossible until it's done and I think that is kind of a very Bayesian viewpoint on the world. If you have no instances of something happening then\n What is your prior for that event? It will seem completely impossible your prior may be zero until it actually happens You know the thing we forget in Bayes theorem is that our actions play a role in determining outcomes and determining how true\n things actually are. But if we internalize that something is true and maybe we're 100% sure that it's true and there's nothing we can do to change it, well then we're gonna keep on doing the same thing and we're gonna keep on getting the same results.\n It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I think a really good understanding of Bayes' theorem implies that experimentation is essential. If you've been doing the same thing for a long time and getting the same result that you're not necessarily happy with,\n maybe it's time to change. So is there something like that that you've been thinking about? If so, let me know in the comments.\n Hey, this episode of Veritasium was supported in part by viewers like you on Patreon and by Audible. Audible is a leading provider of spoken audio information, including an\n unmatched selection of audiobooks, original programming, news, comedy, and more. So if you're thinking about trying something new and you haven't tried Audible yet, you should give them a shot. And for viewers of this channel, they offer a free 30-day trial just by going to audible.com slash Veritasium.\n You know, the book I've been listening to on Audible recently is called The Theory That Would Not Die by Sheryl Burch McGrain and it is an incredible in-depth look at Bayes' theorem and I've learned a lot just listening to this book including the crazy fact that Bayes never came up\n with the mathematical formulation of his rule. That was done independently by the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace. So really I think he deserves a lot of credit for this theory, but Bayes gets naming rights because he was first. If you want you can download this book and listen\n to it as I have when I've just been driving in the car or going to the gym which I'm doing again.

So what are people worried about? That it's going to like explode and release radiation.\n But you don't know what's leaking or radiation? I don't think they actually know what they're worried about getting out of the reactor. So I want to clear up this confusion between radiation on the one hand and the radioactive atoms that release it on the other.\n The radiation is the stuff anything that radiates out from a nucleus we call it nuclear radiation Makes sense and that's the stuff that can actually do damage to your molecules and cells. I have a source here which releases\n beta particles and I have a Geiger counter which makes a click every time it gets hit by a bit of radiation. So you can see that there is a lot of radiation coming from the source right now. It's actually not that much but you know.\n It sounds like a lot. But what I want to point out is that as I move the Geiger counter away from the source, the radiation very quickly falls off. A lot of this radiation can't really pass through air.\n What are we worried about coming out of the plant? I guess the alpha particles really. But you're saying the alpha particles can't get that far? No they can't. So why are we worried about them? They're just going to die one day. Exactly.\n Beta particles? The alpha and beta radiation can be absorbed by next to nothing. Doesn't radiation drop off proportionately as it goes along? And it's not a linear relationship, but it's more of a negative exponential relationship.\n So if the radiation can't go very far, why are we worried about it? Well the truth is we're not worried about the radiation itself, we're worried about the radioactive atoms that release it. So we're worried about the stuff in here.\n In a nuclear power plant there's a lot of radioactive atoms that can escape into the atmosphere, into the environment in the case of an explosion. And it is those radioactive atoms that we're concerned about. These radioactive atoms can be spread in the atmosphere\n over hundreds of kilometers and they can effectively coat everything with a blanket of this radioactive dust. Then you breathe it in or you eat it and it's at that point when the radioactive atom is inside you that it releases its radiation in\n a damaging way because then the radiation is delivered directly to your cells and it can cause damage to your molecules and cells which can lead to health problems later on. So it's not really radiation that we're worried about directly seeping out\n through the walls of nuclear power plants, it's the radioactive material, the radioactive atoms inside that we're worried about escaping and then doing damage once they've reached us.\n you"

If I drop them both at exactly the same time, which one will hit the ground first? Ah, this is a trick one, isn't it?\n The heavy will go down first. Well yeah it'll drop faster. They'll both hit the ground at the same time. I actually would have thought this one would go faster because it's heavier. Maybe it's that one. Maybe this one. So you reckon this will be faster? I reckon that one will be faster. So why does that make a good\n faster? Because the weight pulls it down quicker. What are we measuring when we say, oh it's heavier? What are we feeling? Gravity. Go ahead. Objects being pulled to the earth, I guess.\n Okay, so which of these objects is being more pulled for the earth? That one, the black one. Alright, well here's what we're gonna do. I want you to hold both of those above your head. Can you get them really high? Can you? Get on the counter.\n Three, two, one. Yeah! Exactly the same. I felt it at the same time. Exactly the same time. They hit it at the same time. Was that what you expected?\n No. So what do you make of that? I need to go read more books. Magic? Gravity is going to pull at the same rate, no matter how heavy or how light it is. But gravity is how light or how heavy something is. That's one big massive mind.\n There must be some force that's dragging them down and actually the actual weight of it doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Something to do with mass or something. I can't remember why. It's almost like the weight holds it back in a way even though that doesn't seem to make sense.\n I think you might be hitting on an interesting point there. Weight holds it back. Now it's not actually weight that holds it back, but inertia. That's the tendency of matter to maintain its state of motion. So to remain at rest if stationary, or to continue with constant velocity when\n What's the big idea? The big idea is this one has more mass, so it's got more weight, which you can clearly feel, but it's also got more inertia, which means it's also more sluggish. Right. It tends to resist acceleration. So that greater force is required to accelerate it.\n the same rate as this ball. Like a heavy car trying to accelerate. Like a heavy car trying to accelerate. You need more force to get it going. Exactly. So what does all that mean? Well the force on the medicine ball is greater than the force on the basketball, but it has more inertia. And what's\n What's really important is that the ratio of force to inertia is the same for all objects. So everything accelerates at the same rate and lands at the same time.\n It's in a plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster. Now at some point growing up, most of us have been captivated by one of these, a slinky. So why doesn't the space station come crashing into the earth?"

            "transcription": "Hey everyone, it's me, Derek, from the channel Veritasium. And I've been following this series by Destin on Smarter Every Day about helicopters, and gyroscopic procession is just one of those things that still blows my mind as it did Destin's.\n So I'm here at the University of Sydney, my old stomping grounds. I'm going to borrow some of their lecture dem equipment to hopefully teach you a bit about how gyroscopic procession works. The first thing I need to do is talk about vectors, because a lot of things in physics\n are vectors. That means they have direction. So an example would be momentum and force. Those are two examples of some pretty common vectors. So if I have a cart moving along here, it has some momentum in that direction. And if I apply a force\n to it, I can change its momentum. So for example, if I push it to the right, then its momentum will increase to the right. It all makes a lot of sense. Well there's a similar statement we could make about rotating bodies, which is that a torque,\n increases the angular momentum of an object in the direction of that torque. So let's try to figure out those terms. If I apply a force down on this side of the wheel, I create a torque. Now torque is force times the distance from the rotating axis. You could call it\n So torque is the force applied times the radius away from the turning axis. Now what's the direction of that torque? Well we actually use a right-hand rule to define this and so what you do is you put your fingers in the direction of the radius from the turning axis\n and curl them in the direction of the force and your thumb points in the direction of the torque. So the torque is actually out this way at 90 degrees to the force. The force is down that way but the torque vector is actually pointing out this way. So the angular\n momentum of this wheel is being increased in that direction. So the more I apply this torque, the more I increase the angular momentum of the wheel in the direction of the torque. So I'm making this wheel have a very large angular momentum\n out towards the camera, out towards you. Now before I go any further, let's have a look at this setup that I've got. I have a wheel here hanging from only one side by this rope. And so right now there's actually a torque on the whole system if I let go because the weight of this wheel\n pulling down and that force is applied at this distance away from its pivoting point there. So if I let go, well it does exactly what you'd expect, the wheel swings down this way. But I want to see that as an example.\n example of rotational motion. There's a torque which is pointing out this way, which is trying to increase the angular momentum of the system in that direction. Now angular momentum in that direction requires that the whole system starts swinging anti-clockwise.\n And so that is what happens. But what happens if I only let go after I've already spun up the bicycle wheel? Well in that case, the bicycle wheel would already have angular momentum this way, and so a torque pushing that way actually swings this angular momentum\n round that way. Okay so let me try to get the wheel spinning and make it work. Come on. Oh look at that. It's rotating as we predicted.\n See the angular momentum vector is pointing out this way but torque is pushing it this way. So angular momentum, torque, and torque is pushing that angular momentum vector around. Except not for long because this appears to be quite friction\n friction-full wheel. So check out Destin's other videos about helicopter physics and then come check out my channel Veritasium where you can find more like this. Except I don't often nearly get my head cut off by a bicycle wheel so that...\n you"

He looks back at you, shaking his fist at a constant rate. As he zooms\n Zooms in, gravity gets stronger, so you'd expect him to speed up. But that is not what you see. Instead, the rocket ship appears to be slowing down. Not only that, he also appears to be shaking his fist, slower and slower.\n That's because, from your perspective, his time is slowing down. At the very instant when he should cross the event horizon, the point beyond which not even light can escape, he and his rocket ship do not disappear.\n Instead, they seem to stop, frozen in time. The light from the spaceship gets dimmer and redder until it completely fades from view. This is how any object would look crossing\n the event horizon. Light is still coming from the point where he crossed, it's just too redshifted to see. But if you could see that light, then in theory you would see everything that has ever fallen into the black hole, frozen\n on its horizon, including the star that formed it. But in practice, photons are emitted at discrete intervals, so there will be a last photon emitted outside the horizon, and therefore these images will fade after some time.\n This is just one of the strange results that comes out of the general theory of relativity, our current best theory of gravity. The first solution of Einstein's equations predicted not only black holes, but also their opposite, white holes. It also implied the existence\n of parallel universes and even possibly a way to travel between them. This is a video about the real science of black holes, white holes, and wormholes. The general theory of relativity arose at least in part due to a\n fundamental flaw in Newtonian gravity. In the 1600s, Isaac Newton contemplated how an apple falls to the ground, how the moon orbits the earth and earth orbits the sun, and he concluded that every object with mass must attract every other. But Newton\n Newton was troubled by his own theory. How could masses separated by such vast distances apply a force on each other? He wrote that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else is to me so\n So great an absurdity that I believe no man who has a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it. One man who definitely had a competent faculty of thinking was Albert Einstein, and over 200 years later,\n Later, he figured out how gravity is mediated. Bodies do not exert forces on each other directly. Instead, a mass like the sun curves the spacetime in its immediate vicinity. This then curves the spacetime around\n Masses are affected by the local curvature of spacetime, so no action at a distance\n Can you write down the Einstein field equations?\n On one side it says, tell me about the distribution of matter and energy. The other side tells you what the resultant curvature of space-time is from that distribution of matter and energy. And it's a single line. It looks like, oh, this is a simple\n equation right? But it's not really one equation, it's a family of equations and to make life more difficult they are coupled equations so they depend upon each other and they are differential equations so that means that there are integrals that have to be done da da da.\n So there's a whole bunch of steps that you need to do to solve the field equations. To see what a solution to these equations would look like, we need a tool to understand spacetime. So imagine you're floating around in empty space.\n flash of light goes off above your head and spreads out in all directions. Now, your entire future, anything that can and will ever happen to you, will occur within this bubble. Because the only way to get out of it would be to travel\n faster than light. In two dimensions, this bubble is just a growing circle. If we allow time to run up the screen and take snapshots at regular intervals, then this light bubble traces out a cone, your future light cone. By convention, the axes are\n scaled so that light rays always travel at 45 degrees. This cone reveals the only region of spacetime that you can ever hope to explore and influence. Now imagine that instead of a flash of light above your head, those photons were actually\n traveling in from all corners of the universe, and they met at that instant and then continued traveling on in their separate directions. Well, in that case, then into the past, these photons also reveal a light cone, your past light cone.\n Only events that happened inside this cone could have affected you up to the present moment. We can simplify this diagram even further by plotting just one spatial and one time dimension. This is the space-time diagram of empty space, if you\n want to measure how far apart two events are in spacetime, you use something called the spacetime interval. The interval squared is equal to minus dt squared plus dx squared. Since spacetime is flat, the geometry is the same everywhere,\n and so this formula holds throughout the entire diagram, which makes it really easy to measure the separation between any two events. But around a mass, spacetime is curved, and therefore you need to modify the equation to take into account the geometry.\n This is what solutions to Einstein's equations are like. They tell you how spacetime curves and how to measure the separation between two events in that curve geometry. Einstein published his equations in 1915.\n during the First World War, but he couldn't find an exact solution. Luckily, a copy of his paper made its way to the Eastern Front, where Germany was fighting Russia. Stationed there was one of the best astrophysicists of the time, Carl Schwarzschild.\n Despite being 41 years old, he had volunteered to calculate artillery trajectories for the German army. At least until a greater challenge caught his attention. How to solve Einstein's field equations.\n Schwarzschild did the standard physicist thing and imagined the simplest possible scenario, an eternal static universe with nothing in it except a single spherically symmetric point mass. This mass was electrically neutral and not rotating. Since this was the\n The only feature of his universe, he measured everything using spherical coordinates relative to the center of this mass. So r is the radius and theta and phi give the angles. For his time coordinate, he chose time as being measured by someone far away from the\n where spacetime is essentially flat. Using this approach, Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial solution to Einstein's equations, which nowadays we write like this. This Schwarzschild metric describes how spacetime curves\n outside of the mass. It's pretty simple and makes intuitive sense. Far away from the mass, spacetime is nearly flat, but as you get closer and closer to it, spacetime becomes more and more curved, it attracts objects in, and time runs slower.\n Schwartzschild sent his solution to Einstein, concluding with,\n Einstein replied, But what seemed at first quite simple,\n soon became more complicated. Shortly after Schwarzschild's solution was published, people noticed two problem spots. At the center of the mass at r equals zero, this term is divided by zero, so it blows up to infinity.\n and therefore this equation breaks down and it can no longer describe what's physically happening. This is what's called a singularity. Maybe that point could be excused because it's in the middle of the mass, but there's another problem spot outside of it.\n At a special distance from the center, known as the Schwarzschild radius, this term blows up. So there is a second singularity. What is going on here? Well, at the Schwarzschild radius,\n the spacetime curvature becomes so steep that the escape velocity, the speed that anything would need to leave there, is the speed of light. And that would mean that inside the Schwarzschild radius, nothing, not even light,\n would be able to escape. So you'd have this dark object that swallows up matter and light. A black hole, if you will. But most scientists doubted that such an object could exist because it would require\n How could that possibly ever happen? Astronomers at the time were studying what happens at the end of a star's life.\n During its lifetime, the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward radiation pressure created by the energy released through nuclear fusion. But when the fuel runs out, the radiation pressure drops, so gravity pulls all the star material inwards.\n how far. Most astronomers believed some physical process would hold it up. And in 1926, Ralph Fowler came up with a possible mechanism. Pauli's exclusion principle states that fermions, like electrons, cannot occupy the same\n state, so as matter gets pushed closer and closer together, the electrons each occupy their own tiny volumes. But Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that you can't know the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. So, as the particles become more\n And the more and more constrained in space, the uncertainty in their momentum, and hence their velocity, must go up. So the more a star is compressed, the faster electrons will wiggle around and that creates an outward pressure.\n The neutron degeneracy pressure would prevent the star from collapsing completely. Instead, it would form a white dwarf with a density much higher than a normal star. And remarkably enough, astronomers had observed stars that fit this description. One of them was\n serious bee. But the relief from this discovery was short-lived. Four years later, 19-year-old Supermanian Chandrasekhar traveled by boat to England to study with Fowler and Arthur Eddington, one of the most revered scientists.\n scientists of the time. During his voyage, Chandrasekhar realized that electron degeneracy pressure has its limits. Electrons can wiggle faster and faster, but only up to the speed of light. That means this effect can only support stars\n stars up to a certain mass, the Chandrasekhar limit. Beyond this, Chandrasekhar believed not even electron degeneracy pressure could prevent a star from collapsing. But Eddington was not impressed. He publicly blasted Chandrasekhar\n And indeed, scientists did discover a way that stars heavier than the Chandrasekhar limit could support themselves.\n dwarf, electrons and protons fuse together to form neutrinos and neutrons. These neutrons are also fermions, but with nearly 2000 times the mass of an electron, their degeneracy pressure is even stronger. So this is what holds up\n neutron stars. There was this conviction among scientists that even if we didn't know the mechanism, something would prevent a star from collapsing into a single point and forming a black hole. Because black holes\n The big blow to this belief came in the late 1930s, when J. Robert Oppenheimer and George Volkoff found that neutron stars also have a maximum mass.\n Shortly after, Oppenheimer and Hartland-Snyder showed that for the heaviest stars, there is nothing left to save them when their fuel runs out. They wrote, this contraction will continue indefinitely. But Einstein still couldn't believe it.\n Oppenheimer was saying that stars can collapse indefinitely, but when Einstein looked at the math, he found that time freezes on the horizon, so it seemed like nothing could ever enter. Which suggested that either there's something we don't understand, or that\n black holes can't exist.\n the event horizon, you wouldn't notice anything unusual and you'd go right past it without even knowing it. So how is this possible? We need a space-time diagram of a black hole. On the left is the singularity at our\n r equals zero. The dotted line at r equals 2m is the event horizon. Since the black hole doesn't move, these lines go straight up in time. Now let's see how in-going and outgoing light rays travel in this curved geometry.\n When you're really far away, the future light cones are at the usual 45 degrees. But as you get closer to the horizon, the light cones get narrower and narrower. Until right at the event horizon, they're so narrow that they point\n straight up. And inside the horizon, the light cones tip to the left. But something strange happens with in-going light rays. They fall in, but they don't get to r equals 2m. They actually asymptote.\n to that value as time goes to infinity. But they don't end at infinity, right? Mathematically they are connected and come back in and they're traveling in this direction. And\n And this bothered a lot of people. It's bothered people like Einstein because he looked at these equations and went, well, if nothing can cross this sort of boundary, then how could there be black holes? How could black holes even form?\n So what is going on here? Well, what's important to recognize is that this diagram is a projection. It's basically a 2D map of four-dimensional curved spacetime. It's just like projecting the 3D Earth onto a 2D\n map. When you do that, you always get distortions. There is no perfectly accurate way to map the Earth onto a 2D surface. But different maps can be useful for different purposes. For example, if you want to keep angles and shapes the same, like if you're sailing across the ocean,\n and you need to find your bearings, you can use the Mercator projection. That's the one Google Maps uses. A downside is that it misrepresents sizes. Africa and Greenland look about the same size, but Africa is actually around 14 times\n In a similar way, we can make different projections of 4D spacetime to study different properties of it.\n Physical reality doesn't change, but the way the map describes it does. People realize that if\n If you choose a different coordinate system by doing a coordinate substitution, then the singularity at the event horizon disappears. It goes away. That problem goes away. And things can actually cross into the black hole.\n What this tells us is that there is no real physical singularity at the event horizon. It just resulted from a poor choice of coordinate system. Another way to visualize what's going on is by describing\n space as flowing in towards the black hole, like a waterfall. As you get closer, space starts flowing in faster and faster. Photons emitted by the spaceship have to swim against this flow. And this becomes harder and\n the closer you get. Photons emitted just outside the horizon can barely make it out, but it takes longer and longer. At the horizon, space falls in as fast as the photons are swimming. So if the horizon\n If the horizon had a finite width, then photons would get stuck here, photons from everything that ever fell in. But the horizon is infinitely thin, so in reality, photons either eventually escape or fall in.\n horizon, space falls faster than the speed of light, and so everything falls into the singularity. So Oppenheimer was right. Someone outside a black hole can never see anything enter, because the last photons they can see will all\n Now, you can extend the waterfall model to cover all three spatial dimensions, and that\n you this, a real simulation of space flowing into a static black hole made by my friend Alessandro from Science Click. Later we'll use this model to see what it's like falling into a rotating black hole.\n Now, I've never been sucked into a black hole, but sometimes it feels like it when I'm stuck on the phone with a spam caller. Fortunately, today's sponsor, Incogni, can help. You know, I used to get several spam calls a day, and they frustrated me so much\n that I wrote a letter to the Do Not Call registry to get my number removed, but that didn't work. And so I wanted to go on the offensive. I even contemplated making a video where I just mess with spam callers to get some revenge for all the frustration and lost time.\n But I no longer have to do that thanks to incogni. There are a lot of data brokers out there that suck up information about you a bit like a black hole. They collect things like your name, phone number, email address, and even your social security number.\n And then they sell this information on the open market, which is why we often get calls from people that we've never even given our number to. Incogni battles these data brokers. You simply give them permission and they figure out who out there has your data\n which laws apply, and then they send them the right letter with the correct legal terms to each data broker with the request to remove your information. Now, you could do this yourself, but it's a super tedious process that would take days, weeks, even months, and\n then you'd have to keep doing it forever. So that's something I definitely don't have the time and energy for. But Incogni makes this really easy. Just sign up and they'll give you a list of companies that have your data, the severity of each claim, and the status\n us of each request. So far they have filed 126 requests for me, 83 of which have been completed, saving me over 62 hours of work. But the best part is, since I signed up, I've hardly gotten any more spam calls.

If you take this map and transform it so that incoming and outgoing light rays all travel at 45 degrees like we're used to,\n then something fascinating happens. The black hole singularity on the left transforms into a curved line at the top. And since the future always points up in this map, it tells us that\n the singularity is not actually a place in space, instead it's a moment in time. The very last moment in time for anything that enters a black hole. The map we've just created is a\n Kruskal-Zekker's diagram. But this only represents a portion of the universe, the part inside the black holes of Enterizon and the part of the universe closest to it. But what we can do is contract the whole universe, the infinite past\n infinite distance and infinite future and morph it into a single map. It's like using the universe's best fisheye lens. That gives us this Penrose diagram. Again, light rays still always go\n at 45 degrees, so the future always points up. The infinite past is in the bottom of the diagram, the infinite future at the top, and the sides on the right are infinitely far away. The black hole singularity is now a straight line at the top.\n a final moment in time. These lines are all at the same distance from the black hole, so the singularity is at r equals zero, the horizon is at r equals 2m, this line is at r equals 4m,\n And this is infinitely far away. All of these lines are at the same time. What's great about this map is that it's very easy to see where you can still go and what could have affected you. For example, when you're here, you've got a lot of free\n freedom, you can enter the black hole or fly off to infinity, and you can see and receive information from this area. But if you go beyond the horizon, your only possible future is to meet the singularity. You\n You can still however see and receive information from the universe, you just can't send any back out. Now think about being at this point in the map. This is at the event horizon, and now your entire future is within the black hole.\n But what is the past of this moment? Well, you can draw the past light cone and it reveals this new region. If you're inside this region, you can send signals to the universe, but no matter where you are in the universe,\n nothing can ever enter this region because it will never be inside your light cone. So things can come out but never go in. This is the opposite of a black hole, a white hole.\n What colour is a white hole? I mean it's gonna be the... it's not gonna have a colour right? It's gonna be whatever's being spat out of it. It depends what is\n there and gets thrown out that's what you are going to see. So if it's got light in there, it's got mass in there, it's all going to be ejected. So the white hole kind of picture is the time reverse picture of a black hole. Instead of things falling in, things get\n expelled outwards. And so whilst a black hole has a membrane, the swartial horizon, which once you cross you can't get back out, the white hole has the opposite. If you're inside the event horizon you have to be ejected. So it\n kicks you out kind of thing. Relativity doesn't tell you which way time flows. There's nothing in there that says that that is the future and that is the past. When you're doing your mathematics and you're working out the behavior of objects,\n you make a choice about which direction is the future. But mathematically you could have chosen the other way, right? You could have had time point in the opposite direction. Any solution that you find in relativity, mathematically you can\n Now, we've been showing things being ejected to the right, but they could just as well be ejected to the left. So what's over there?\n The line is not at infinity, so there should be something beyond it. If we eject things in this direction, you find that they enter a whole new universe, one parallel to our own.\n We can fall into this black hole and somebody in this universe here could fall into this black hole in their universe and we would find ourselves in the same black hole. The only downside is that we'd both\n soon end up in the singularity.\n these terms here that's the other universe or do you know what I mean like well it's it's coordinates right imagine somebody right came up with a coordinate system for the earth but only the northern hemisphere and you looked at that coordinate system\n system, right? And you looked at it and you said, ah, I can see the coordinate system, it looks fine, but mathematically, latitudes can be negative, right? You've only got positive latitudes in your solution. What about the negative ones?\n And they say to you, negative ones? No southern hemisphere? And you've got to go, well, the mathematics says that you can have negative latitudes. Maybe we should go and look over the equator to see if there is something down there. And I know there's a kind of\n extreme example because we know we live on a globe, but we don't know the full geometry of what's going on here in the sense that Swartzschild laid down coordinates over part of the solution. It was like him only laying down coordinates on the northern hemisphere.\n And other people have come along and said, hey, this is southern hemisphere. And more than that, there's two Earths. That's why it's called maximal extension. It's like, if I have this mathematical structure, then what is\n the extent of the coordinates that I can consider. And with the Swatchill black hole you get a second universe that has its own independent set of coordinates from our universe. I want to emphasize, right, this is the simplest\n solution to the Einstein field equations and it already contains a black hole, white hole and two universes. That's what you get when you push this map to its limits so that every edge ends at a singularity or infinity. And in fact there's another little\n feature in here, which is that little point there where they cross, that is an Einstein-Rosen bridge. To see it, we need to change coordinates. Now, this line is at constant crustal time.\n and it connects the space of both universes. You can see what the spacetime is like by following this line from right to left. Far away from the event horizon, spacetime is basically flat, but as you get closer to the event horizon, spacetime starts to curve\n more and more. At this cross, you're at the event horizon, and if you go beyond it, you end up in the parallel universe. That gives you a wormhole that looks like this.\n That is, hypothetically, how we could use a black hole to travel from one universe to another. Hypothetically, because these wormholes aren't actually stable in time. It's a bit like a bridge, but it's a bridge that is long and then becomes short.\n and then becomes long again. And if you try to traverse this bridge, at some point the bridge is only very short, right? And you say, well, let me just cross this bridge. But as you start crossing the bridge and start running, your speed is finite, right? The speed of light, roughly. And then the bridge starts moving.\n This pinching off always happens too fast for anything to travel through. You can also see this if you look at the Penrose diagram, because when you're inside one universe,\n there isn't a light cone that can take you to the other universe. The only way to do that would be to travel faster than light. But there might be another way. Schwarzschild's solution describes a black hole that doesn't rotate.\n Yet, every star does rotate, and since angular momentum must be conserved, every black hole must also be rotating. While Schwarzschild found his solution within weeks after Einstein published his equations, solving them for a spinning mass turned out to be much harder.\n harder. Physicists tried, but 10 years after Schwarzschild's solution, they still hadn't solved it. 10 years turned into 20, which turned into 40. And then, in 1963, Roy Kerr found the solution to Einstein's equations for\n a spinning black hole, which is far more complicated than Schwarzschild's solution. And this comes with a few dramatic changes. The first is that the structure is completely different. The black hole now consists\n of several layers. It's also not spherically symmetric anymore. This happens because the rotation causes it to bulge around the equator, so it's only symmetric about its axis of spin.\n Alessandro from Science Click simulated what happens around this spinning black hole. Space gets dragged around with the black hole, taking you and the particles along with it. When you get closer, space gets\n dragged around faster and faster, until it goes around faster than the speed of light. You've now entered into the first new region, the ergosphere. No matter how hard you fire your rockets here, it's impossible\n to stay still relative to distant stars. But because space doesn't flow directly inward, you can still escape the black hole. When you travel in further, you go through the next layer, the outer horizon, the point\n point of no return. Here you can only go inwards. But as you get dragged in deeper and deeper, something crazy happens. You enter another region, one where you can move around freely again.\n So you're not doomed to the singularity. You're now inside the inner event horizon. Here you can actually see the singularity. In a normal black hole it's a point. But in a rotating black hole it actually\n expands out to be a ring. And there are weird things happened with space-time inside the center of a black hole, a rotating black hole, but it's thought that you can actually fly through the singularity.\n We need a Penrose diagram of a spinning black hole. Where before the singularity was a horizontal line at the top, here the singularity lifts up and moves to the sides, revealing this new region inside the inner horizon.\n Here, we can move around freely and avoid the singularity. But these edges aren't at infinity or a singularity, so there must be something beyond them. Well, when you venture further, you could find yourself in a white\n hole, which would push you out into a whole other universe.\n and you pop out into a new universe from a white hole. And then you can just continue playing this game. Extending this diagram infinitely far. But there is still one thing we haven't done. Brave the Singularity.\n So, you aim straight towards the center of the ring and head off towards it. But rather than time ending, you now find yourself in another universe. A strange universe, one where gravity pushes instead of pulls.\n This is known as an anti-verse. If that's too weird, you can always jump back across the singularity and return to a universe with normal gravity.\n The solutions of relativity at, you know, essentially at face value and add on a little bit, which is what Penrose does here, says, oh look, these shapes are very similar, I can just stick these together. Then this is the conclusion that you get.\n have effectively an infinite number of universes all connected with black hole white holes all the way through and you often go to explore. But it'll be a very brave person who's the first one who's going to leap into a rotating black\n hole to find out if this is correct. Yeah, I would not sign up for that. So could these maximally extended Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions actually exist in nature? Well, there are some issues. Both the extended Schwarzschild\n field and Kerr solutions are solutions of eternal black holes in an empty universe.\n just a static solution. And I think that is part of the reason why black holes are realized in our universe and white holes aren't.\n Or might not be. Or might not be. I'm reasonably confident that they don't exist, right? For the maximally extended Kerr solution, there's also another problem. If you're an immortal astronaut inside the universe, you can send light\n into the black hole. But because there's infinite time compressed in this top corner, you can pile up light along this edge, which creates an infinite flux of energy along the inner horizon. This concentration of energy then creates its\n own singularity, sealing off the ring singularity and beyond.\n So all the white holes, wormholes, other universes, and anti-universes disappear? Does that mean that real wormholes are impossible? In 1987, Michael Morris and Kip Thorne looked at wormholes that an advanced civilization could use\n for interstellar travel. Ones that have no horizons so you can travel back and forth, are stable in time, and have some other properties, like being able to construct them. They found several geometries that are allowed by Einstein's general relativity. In theory, these\n could connect different parts of the universe, making a sort of interstellar highway. They might even be able to connect to different universes. The only problem is that all these geometries require an exotic kind of matter with a negative\n energy density to prevent the wormhole from collapsing.\n mathematically possible. It's true it's mathematically possible in the sense that there's some geometry that can exist, but Einstein's theory is not just geometries. It's geometries plus field equations. If you use the kinds of properties of matter that\n matter actually has, then they're not possible. So I feel that the reason they're not possible is very strong. So according to our current best understanding, it seems likely that white holes, traversable wormholes, and these parallel universes\n don't exist. But we also used to think the black holes didn't exist, so maybe we'll be surprised again. I mean, we have one universe, right? Good. Why can't we have two?\n you\n you"

So what are people worried about? That it's going to like explode and release radiation.\n But you don't know what's leaking or radiation? I don't think they actually know what they're worried about getting out of the reactor. So I want to clear up this confusion between radiation on the one hand and the radioactive atoms that release it on the other.\n The radiation is the stuff anything that radiates out from a nucleus we call it nuclear radiation Makes sense and that's the stuff that can actually do damage to your molecules and cells. I have a source here which releases\n beta particles and I have a Geiger counter which makes a click every time it gets hit by a bit of radiation. So you can see that there is a lot of radiation coming from the source right now. It's actually not that much but you know.\n It sounds like a lot. But what I want to point out is that as I move the Geiger counter away from the source, the radiation very quickly falls off. A lot of this radiation can't really pass through air.\n What are we worried about coming out of the plant? I guess the alpha particles really. But you're saying the alpha particles can't get that far? No they can't. So why are we worried about them? They're just going to die one day. Exactly.\n Beta particles? The alpha and beta radiation can be absorbed by next to nothing. Doesn't radiation drop off proportionately as it goes along? And it's not a linear relationship, but it's more of a negative exponential relationship.\n So if the radiation can't go very far, why are we worried about it? Well the truth is we're not worried about the radiation itself, we're worried about the radioactive atoms that release it. So we're worried about the stuff in here.\n In a nuclear power plant there's a lot of radioactive atoms that can escape into the atmosphere, into the environment in the case of an explosion. And it is those radioactive atoms that we're concerned about. These radioactive atoms can be spread in the atmosphere\n over hundreds of kilometers and they can effectively coat everything with a blanket of this radioactive dust. Then you breathe it in or you eat it and it's at that point when the radioactive atom is inside you that it releases its radiation in\n a damaging way because then the radiation is delivered directly to your cells and it can cause damage to your molecules and cells which can lead to health problems later on. So it's not really radiation that we're worried about directly seeping out\n through the walls of nuclear power plants, it's the radioactive material, the radioactive atoms inside that we're worried about escaping and then doing damage once they've reached us.\n you"

It even wreaks havoc on camera equipment.\n So if it's a CMOS sensor, the electrons just can't find their way. Well, they get redirected. So yeah, if you notice bad video or audio, know that it's incredibly hard to shoot in these magnetic fields. A portion of this video was sponsored by Google.\n I came to the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida, where since the year 2000, they have held the Guinness World Record for the strongest continuous magnetic field.\n For reference, the magnetic field of the earth is .00005 Tesla.\n Magnet is around 0.01 Tesla. MRI machines can get up to 3 Tesla. But this electromagnet creates a magnetic field of 45 Tesla. So nearly a million times Earth's magnetic\n field. To achieve this field, the magnet consists of an outer superconducting magnet and an inner resistive magnet. I'll explain why you need both types in a moment. The apparatus is two stories tall, but the\n The maximum field or field center only occurs in the center of a narrow cylinder that runs through the middle. Right now it's off, isn't it? There's no matter. Can I put my finger in the bore? Is that a bad idea? No, it's fine. You can totally do that.\n Let me see. So that's where there's 45 Tesla. Further down. A meter away from that. A meter down. And so that just drops down for... It's clear all the way through to the bottom. Oh wow. The maximum field is basically a centimeter tall.\n Here we have very small samples. Think something like a chip in a computer or a cell phone. That's what users will come in with. So that's plenty big for what we want to do with material science or condensed matter research. Since we can't see or film in the center of the world,\n of the magnet, we're going to experiment with a magnetic field that extends above and around the magnet on this platform. So the magnet's over there, yes, but the magnetic field extends all the way out here, yes, and past. This is known as the fringe field, and although it\n it's much weaker than 45 Tesla, it is still plenty dangerous.\n the windings and you have to form a complete loop. So those loops just move further and further and further out to make that feel. So this is the 100 Gauss line for the fringe field. So what happens to objects around the 100 Gauss line? Things with shapes will start\n orienting themselves to the field. So if you have it sitting on a tabletop, say over here, it will start pivoting on its own. And if you get it too much closer, it will just go. And by the time you notice it's moving, it's already too\n meaning no ferromagnetic objects within the 100 Gauss line. If you have anything ferromagnetic on you, any implants that are metallic, pacemaker, anybody? Anybody? Okay. Ramping up this magnet to full power,\n takes around an hour and a half. That's because they have to put 47,000 amps of current into the outer superconducting electromagnet. 47,000 amps. 47,000 amps 500 volts. That is so insane. All right so let's take it all\n One thing that happens in a strong magnetic field, obviously, is that magnetic materials are attracted to it. We cut open a Nerf football and put in a couple steel washers, being careful to tape it up so the washers\n can't get out. We also covered the opening to the magnet so the ball won't get sucked down into it. I got an unmodified Nerf football. And sure enough, it's easy to tell which ball contains the washers.\n I tried to throw the football and hit the side of the magnet. After a few misses, it bounced around and stuck. It should have looked\n more like this. Another thing to do if you have a strong magnet is get ferrofluid. Ferrofluid contains nanoscale pieces of magnetite, that's an iron containing mineral, and they're suspended in solution coated in surfactant\n so they don't all clump together. But in an external magnetic field, they all line up, like iron filings around a bar magnet. This ferrofluid started to develop parallel ridges, even meters away from the magnet, and as we got closer\n Closer, spikes formed on the surface, aligning the magnetite particles with the field. Closer still, and the ferrofluid climbed up the side of the vessel.\n Magnetite is actually the mineral that led people to discover the phenomenon of magnetism in the first place. At least 3,000 years ago, naturally magnetized pieces of magnetite were found\n found in a part of Greece called Magnesia. That's actually where the word magnet comes from. In Greek, they were called stones from Magnesia. But they were also referred to as lodestones, and it was discovered that lodestones could attract\n each other or pieces of iron, and by the 11th century in China it was realized that magnets could be used to make a compass needle that would always point in the same direction. The side that pointed to the north of the earth was referred to as a north-seeking pole, and the other side\n the south-seeking pole, though these days we often just say north pole and south pole of the magnet. But why are only some materials magnetic? Electrons are essentially tiny magnets, but in most atoms they are paired up,\n In elements with half full outer shells of electrons, well then they can't pair up, so atoms have magnetic fields. But if neighboring atoms aren't aligned,\n Well then, the magnetic fields of all the atoms cancel out, and the bulk material is non-magnetic. But even if you get all these atoms aligning in one part of the material, known as a domain, they may be aligned opposite atoms in other domains and cancel out.\n So you need all the domains to be aligned. Normally when you see these, they're really strong magnets, but not here, not yet. And this can be done by applying a strong external magnetic field. So right now these are not magnetic. They do not\n stick to each other but he is loading them in there into the hemholz coil. And then you get a permanent magnet. Materials that meet these criteria are called ferromagnetic.\n after iron, the most common magnetic element, but nickel and cobalt are also ferromagnetic. In the powerful magnetic field around the world's strongest magnet, what is even more surprising to see is the behavior of non-ferromagnetic materials.\n Here we have four sheets of different materials, two different types of plastic, copper, and aluminum. When they are stationary in the field, there's no difference between them, but when they move, materials that conduct\n electricity fall a lot slower. I'll get into that, but first, this portion of the video was sponsored by Google, and they were interested in this video because it's all about magnets.\n which are core to our future. Electric vehicles, for example, use electric motors which need magnets to work. And US search interest for electric vehicle reached an all-time high in the last 12 months. That is, according to Google Trends, a tool that allows you to see\n what people are searching for. The thing that connects these trending searches and many others is that people are trying to find ways of doing things that are less destructive to the planet. And Google is like, we live on this planet too, we also want to do that. In fact, Google has matched a\n 100% of their electricity use with renewable energy since 2017. They also run Project Sunroof, which helps people decide if solar is right for their home by providing Google Maps data to create a 3D model of your roof and estimate energy savings from rooftop solar.\n Personally, I'm just happy to learn that people are searching for things related to sustainability, and that Google has made a real commitment to sustainability too. You can learn more about sustainability and Google's efforts at sustainability.google. So thanks to Google for sponsoring that part of my video.\n And now, back to magnets. What's happening is that as the metal plate is falling through the field, the number of magnetic field lines passing through it is changing. This change in magnetic flux induces electric currents called eddy currents.\n in the plate, which create their own magnetic field that opposes the change in flux. This is known as Lenz's law. So if the plate is falling towards a north magnetic pole, the induced currents create a north magnetic pole themselves so that\n plate is repelled and so it falls much slower.\n Now, it is slight, but I think you can see that the plate is warming up a bit as it falls. Previously, I visited an electromagnetic levitator at the\n the Palace of Discovery in Paris. It uses an alternating current to levitate a plate, but the eddy currents in that plate generate so much heat that water actually boils on its surface. Check out how hot this plate is.\n I like to think of Lenza's law as the no you don't law because whatever you try to do nature acts to oppose you. If the plate is falling eddy currents are induced to slow down\n its descent. But if you try to pick up the plate, nature also says no you don't. In this case a south magnetic pole is\n induced under the plate, attracting it back to the magnet.\n You're strong like bull! No matter how hard I tried to push the plate down, it just wouldn't go very fast. Because even if I could speed it up a little bit, that would increase the rate of change of flux and hence the induced currents and their association.\n We tried a number of other conductive but non-ferromagnetic objects around the magnet, like this thick cylinder of aluminum. Drop it straight on the magnet\n and nature says, no you don't. Try to roll it across the top? No you don't. We wrapped up a volleyball in aluminum foil and passed it across the magnet.\n Or dropped it straight in? Again, the changing magnetic flux induces eddy currents that produce their own magnetic field to oppose the original change.\n We wanted to see just how much deceleration the fringe field of the 45 Tesla Magnet could achieve, so we decided to fire projectiles from a potato cannon across the top.\n This is what the projectile looked like with the magnetic field off and\n This is what it looked like with the magnetic field on. If we compare the two shots, you can see that as the projectile enters the magnetic field, the induced eddy currents rotate the projectile, so it remains oriented along\n the magnetic field lines, and this minimizes the change in flux that's experienced by the projectile. Now some of the projectiles contain coils of wire that were connected to LEDs.\n And sure enough, these projectiles light up, showing how the induced\n currents are changing in the coil. You know, in all these cases, the induced electric energy is dissipated either as light or heat. But what if you had a material that didn't dissipate energy, like a\n superconductor below its critical temperature. There are two important things to know about the high temperature superconductor we're using here. First, below its critical temperature most of the material has zero electrical resistance, which means if you bring a magnet\n it close to it, currents will be induced to oppose the change in flux. And since it's a superconductor, those currents can persist indefinitely and expel all of the magnetic field. Second, there are some filaments through the material that are not superconducting.\n superconducting.\n configuration. This is the human levitator. It consists of a 90 pound or 40 kilogram magnet hovering above a ring of superconductors. So I'm standing on the magnet and underneath is the superconductor. That's right. When I stand on\n the magnet it is pressed down into the superconductors. But the increase in magnetic flux is opposed by currents in the superconductors, creating a magnetic field that repels the magnetic field from the magnet I'm standing on.\n moment oh yeah so I remain levitating above the superconductors. I also brought a leaf blower if you want to hold on to that and turn it on. For real? It's up to you.\n Now there's another way to levitate in a magnetic field that has\n nothing to do with induced eddy currents. And it's all because all materials actually have magnetic properties. They're just hard to see unless a strong magnetic field is present. Some materials are always attracted to magnetic\n fields. They display what's called paramagnetism. Oxygen is like this. It doesn't matter if it's a north or south magnetic pole, the presence of the external\n field causes the magnetic field of the material to strengthen the overall magnetic field and that causes attraction. Other materials, in fact most materials, are repelled by a strong enough magnetic field either north or south and this is known as\n as diamagnetism. Water is a good example of this. In the presence of the external field, the water molecules become opposing magnets, effectively, and so they are repelled. So here you can see how bringing a magnet close to the surface of water\n You can use this repulsion in a strong enough magnetic field to levitate objects you ordinarily wouldn't think of as magnetic. Here we're using a slightly weaker 31 Tesla magnet so that we can use a periscope magnet to levitate objects.\n setup to actually see into the bore. This strawberry will be magnetic in a strong enough field. Well, it's diamagnetic right now.\n we're not in a strong enough field. Right. Yeah. For us to see anything. Mm hmm. Correct. Because of the water. Right. Water is diamagnetic and there's a lot of water in strawberries. Oh, that's nice. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah, it's beautiful.\n The same occurs with a raspberry or a little piece of plastic pizza. Living organisms contain enough water that they too can be levitated. They wouldn't do it here at the mag lab, but people have levitated\n frogs, and grasshoppers? Even mice, an experiment meant to help understand the effects of weightlessness without having to go into space.\n So are very strong magnetic fields safe for living things?\n So how do you actually make the world's strongest magnet?\n Contrary to what I expected, you can't do it just with superconducting magnets alone. That's because superconductors have a limit to the amount of magnetic field they can\n withstand before they're no longer superconducting. So the solution is to combine an outer superconducting electromagnet with an inner electromagnet made of ordinary wire. So the blue, green, and salmon colored bits?\n That's the superconducting out cert that produces 11.5 Tesla inside of that. We put a resistive magnet that produces 33 and a half Tesla Maxwell's equations fields add we get 45 Tesla. But making high field\n Magnets with ordinary resistive wire is really hard.\n not get the heat out of the innermost windings. So back in the 1950s, Francis Bitter up at MIT, he realized that physics doesn't care what shape the conductor is. You can take your round wire and smash it into a very thin plate.\n If you then stack those plates with alternating insulators, you make a helix that electrically looks just like that. But now I can push cooling water axially through the stack of conductor.\n So that means that innermost part, I can now pull all that heat away, which means I can go to much, much, much, much, much higher currents through these coils up to 57,000 amps than what you can do with a traditional wire-wound electromagnet.\n like 34 Tesla that that gives you 33.5 but it's stacked up so we stack all of these up in a stacking jig they're lined up with tie rods we then put about 20 tons of force on it and then lock those tie rods down and that holds the coil together\n and gives us our electrical connection between each turn. And we're pushing, you know, several thousand gallons per minute of deionized water through those coils to keep them cold because otherwise it melts and you're done. Occasionally you get material\n failure that happens when the material goes past its plastic limit and starts flexing either into the coil next to it or maybe even shorting to ground. And this is what happened here. The coil plastically failed, meaning the metal went\n beyond its springy characteristics where it would come back and it just completely deformed, which drove it into the coil next to it, burned through the insulator, and then vaporized all of this metal\n You can see more on the inside. It killed this coil, which is the B coil, but because it failed on the inner edge, it killed the A coil. Failed on the outer edge, it also killed the C coil. So that was an expensive failure.\n Yeah, yeah. Running this strongest magnetic field in the world, period. China recently commissioned their 45 Tesla hybrid, very similar in concept to ours, so now there's two of them in the world.\n magnets on the planet takes a lot of energy. The MAG lab uses a significant fraction of Tallahassee's electricity.\n What's the electricity budget of this place? So nominal $250,000 to $300,000 a month. Holy crap, yeah, that's a lot. So we operate in their federally mandated reserve, which every utility has to have. They have to have that available\n to push into the grid if there's a problem. We have a deal set up with the city so that they can actually make money off that power that they have to produce but which they can't sell. The flip side is when they need it we ramp down and we can go down much faster than they can spin\n Why do you need 45 pet books? There are a couple things that drive material discovery. One of them is just growing a new material. The other one is putting it in an extreme environment like high magnetic field, high electric field, high pressure.\n pressure, ultra low temperature. Another axis is taking an existing material and improving its cleanliness. So getting all the impurities out. So as you drop the impurities in the material, you're reducing where\n the electron scatter from in there and that improves the properties, enables you to see things that you were never able to see before. We've only just barely scratched the surface on what can be done with this. People are going to look back about 25\n years from now and this will be the inflection point this five-year period.\n you"

            "transcription": "So the people from the Hunger Games came to me and they asked me if I wanted to do an experiment that would be related to power generation and strangely there is this one idea that I've been thinking about for years and now finally I have the chance to do it. Come check it out. First positions, here we go.\n We have a set up here with two rain shower heads making two streams of water. Now each stream is going to pass through a set of coils right up by\n where they're released and then it passes through this wire mesh down below. Now these two sets of coils, so this set of coils is separate from this set of coils and they're each connected to one of these balls here. Once we get the water flowing\n We should be able to generate a little electric spark right here. There it is. What's incredible is that we're generating a spark which is probably 5 to 10,000 volts. It would give you a decent little shock. I mean, it's not actually dangerous.\n because although the voltage is high, there's not that much charge behind it, so you can't get that much current flowing, and current is what really does damage. Now the question is, how, just out of this setup where we have falling water and some pieces of metal, do we generate\n 10,000 volts. Well the way it works is that normally water is perfectly neutral. There's even numbers of positive ions and negative ions. But as the water comes out of these two shower heads, sometimes there's going to be a slight imbalance, maybe a little bit more negative\n in this stream and a little bit more positive in that stream. Now normally that just kind of washes out over time, but not in this case. Here's the ingenious part. The mesh on the left is connected to the ring on the right. So if this\n mesh becomes negatively charged then so does this ring and now that ring will attract the positively charged water so this whole stream becomes positively charged therefore when it lands on this mesh this\n smash becomes positively charged as well, which means this coil over here is positively charged, forcing the negative ions to be coming out of this stream more. And so what we have is a clear separation of charge. There's a positively charged stream on\n on the right and a negatively charged stream on the left. If you look closely at the streams, what you can actually see is they get more and more attracted to these top coils and then the spark goes and they reset.\n So basically what's happening is we're building up charge on these coils and then when the charge gets big enough it jumps across from the negative side to the positive side and everything becomes neutral again and\n charging process can start afresh. It's a pretty phenomenal piece of physics. I mean it's such a basic setup and yet it produces this very impressive result. This was noticed over a hundred years ago by a guy named Lord Kelvin so it's often called Lord\n Kelvin's water dropper or Lord Kelvin's rainstorm. It's a really impressive phenomenon. But you might be wondering how much energy could I really get out of this system. Well to put this in perspective, if you were to charge your phone on the energy generated by this\n this\n is just falling water and metal pipes. I want you to leave me your answer in the comments below or make me a video response."

            "transcription": "But this is going to be really tough to see, so how are we going to actually determine what the right answer is? If I were to drop it now, it would happen so fast you wouldn't really see clearly what's happening. So I've brought along my slow motion camera.\n and you'll see it at 300 frames per second and it's quite spectacular. Well that's ultra slow-mo, so that's exactly what we need to sort out this problem. We'll give a countdown because it happens really fast. Alright. 3, 2, 1, drop.\n Wow, did you see that? I didn't really see which happened first. No, I need to slow that down. Well, let's go to a slow motion replay and see what actually happened.\n So from the slow-motion camera we can clearly see that the bottom\n Well there are a number of explanations, but the simplest explanation\n is that the bottom end is sitting there minding its own business with gravity pulling it down and tension pulling it up equal and opposite forces, no motion at the bottom end until the bottom end gets the information that the tension\n And it takes time for that information to propagate down through the slinky to reach the bottom end. So it's propagating down as a compressional wave. And we saw that compression wave travel down and it has to reach the bottom before the bottom even knows that you've let go at the top.\n Correct. And that's when it knows to start falling. Correct. That's a really remarkable finding. I mean, does this apply to any other objects or is it just slinkies? No, it applies to the real world, particularly in sports, which is the field I'm interested in.\n For example, when a player hits a ball, there's a huge force at the business end, but that force is not felt at the handle end until the ball is well on its way. So a wave has to propagate.\n So, wow, if you're playing tennis or something, you only feel that you've hit the ball after\n you've actually hit the ball? The ball's nearly to the net by the time you actually feel what's happened. That goes against all your intuitions that you really can feel it as soon as the ball's on your racket. It's the same in golf. If you whack a golf ball\n ball, you often find golfers will finish with a nice flourish, thinking that it has some effect on the ball, but of course the ball is halfway to the hole by the time that happens. Of course. Now, what if we wanted to do a little extension activity?\n I want you to make a prediction. If we attach this tennis ball onto the base of the slinky and we drop it again, what will happen to the tennis ball? Will it do the same as the base of the slinky and just stay there? Or will it fall with the acceleration\n due to gravity g? Or will it go upwards? Well, I have to try it and find out. Alright, I'd like you to make your prediction now. Quick!\n you"

It's got...\n bit of string glued to the left side of it to make the ball curve to the left. Why is that? That's because the air that's flowing from the front of the ball around to the back encounters this seam, becomes turbulent and turbulent air\n air is known to stick to the ball longer than smooth or laminar flow and so the air is deflected this way to the right on the ball and therefore there's a force on the ball to the left and so it curves.\n This is quite a light ball so it curves a long way. But on a cricket ball the seam isn't on one side, the seam is down the middle. Correct. It's spinning in such a way that the seam's inclined at an angle.\n to the direction of motion of the ball. In which case air coming towards the ball will flow smoothly around the smooth side and separates from the ball. Air flowing on the rough side, the same side,\n becomes turbulent as soon as it encounters that seam, gets deflected to the left, and therefore the ball gets deflected to the right. So you basically make a rough side using that seam by angling the seam? With a cricket ball.\n Or you can have a rough and a smooth side because as time goes on during the game, one side gets rougher than the other. The players maintain the smooth side by polishing it or wherever as if they're scratching themselves.\n really need the same to have that effect because the effect is just a rough side and a smooth side. So a ball always swing towards the rough side? It does. But how does someone swing a baseball then? That relies on the Magnus effect\n normally so if the spin is about a vertical axis it'll either curve to the left or curve to the right. As a curve ball. Exactly. However there's a pitch ball known as a scuff ball that\n people don't like to know about because it's illegal and if you're roughing up one side of the ball surreptitiously without anybody noticing it and then toss it, it will curve a long way just like the cricket ball.\n rough side. Correct. However, there's an effect discovered just this year, which is fairly obvious when you think about it. You can have a smooth patch on a baseball. But I mean, the seam seems to be symmetric\n everywhere. So how can you really have a smooth patch? Well what you do there is to make sure the axis passes through a spot which is a large distance from the seam. In other words, right about there it's about one inch away from the seam and if it rotates about that\n And so it swings away from the smooth spot? Ah, so you've tried this out with one of your polycyrene balls.\n see the effect more dramatically but it's also on film from a real baseball match in April this year. It was filmed on notice for the first time that it's curving the wrong way.\n So who explained this effect? Me.\n You were the first person to explain how you can cause baseball to swing in the opposite direction. It took an Aussie to show the Americans how it's done exactly. Well why don't we play a bit of ball with that thing? I don't think you can swing that as much.\n I can't. Yeah? So let's give it a shot."

            "transcription": "Now in a previous video I showed you that you can only suck up a straw that's 10.3 meters long and that's even if you can create a perfect vacuum inside your mouth. If you haven't seen the original video, check it out. But that raises an interesting question which is how can these\n trees which are 100 meters high get the water all the way from their roots up to the leaves. The argument as you're alluding to is that if you're sucking water up through a drinking straw for example you can only have a straw 33 feet\n The reason for this height limit is because the weight of the water in a column must be supported by the pressure difference between the top and the bottom. So at the bottom you're going to have atmospheric pressure, and the lowest pressure you can produce at the top would be a vacuum, that is zero pressure.\n So atmospheric pressure can support a column of water that is only 10 meters high. What's worse is if you were able to create a vacuum, the water would start boiling spontaneously. That's called cavitation. And obviously that can't be taking place within a tree.\n So, how are they doing it? Well, we started to develop some different theories.\n to be the truth. This big tube, which you're saying needs to be filled with water, is actually made up of cells. The tree effectively has valves in it, so you don't have a column of water that is much higher than 33 feet or less.\n so that the water is pumped up by osmotic pressure due to differences in concentration of sugars and so on. But each individual stage is just quite a small one. My guess is that it's probably more like a bucket brigade\n once you know here we're at the end there's sunlight coming in and it heats up the water and the water evaporates and so the water goes off as water vapor vaporize off. Now this guy's like my buckets empty I want some more water and\n Now another theory is that osmotic pressure at the base could actually push the water all the way up\n the tree, if the solute concentration is different enough between the roots and the water in the surrounding soil, then water would actually want to push into the roots in order to equalize the solute concentrations. That could create a positive pressure which would push the water up the tree. And this\n This hypothesis led me to being challenged to blow water up a tube. Now the water as you can see is Veritasium color. 3, 2, 1, go!\n Now my ability to blow water up that tube was impressive, but I don't really think that a tree would be able to get so much on\n pressure at the roots that it could push the water up 100 meters. Well, some people may be wondering why we haven't talked about capillary action yet. That's due to the adhesion between the water molecules and the walls of a tube, so you can suck water up through perforated material.\n Now, I'm not sure that the tubes inside a tree are small enough for this effect to have a significant impact, but it may. Well, I don't want to give you the complete answer yet. I'd like you guys to tell me what you think and maybe post a video response.\n tell you that I had a significant misconception that was stopping me from working this out. So if you can spot what that is, do let me know. And let me give you a summary of the ideas we came up with. One, that the tree does not contain a continuous water column\n 2. Osmotic pressure at the roots, pushing the water up the tree 3. Osmotic pressure throughout the tree, helps pull the water up 4. Capillary action So let me know what roles you think those\n different factors play in allowing a tree to draw the water up 100 meters. And if you don't want to do that work, then subscribe to the channel and I'll post the answer in a week.\n you"

            "transcription": "I am here to sign a document betting $10,000 that my last video is in fact correct. This is the video in question. Some people may have missed it, but in this car there is no motor, no batteries,\n No energy source besides the wind itself. And the counterintuitive claim is that this car can maintain speeds faster than the wind that's pushing it. There is a physics professor at UCLA who got in touch to\n say that he thought that I was wrong, that the explanation was wrong. You know, we went back and forth a little bit and eventually I said, well how about we bet? Ten thousand dollars. I can prove it to you, this vehicle really can't go downwind faster than the wind.\n And to my surprise, he is taking me up on the bet. Now, Professor Alex Kosenko wanted this wager and all related disc\n And Alex, I just want to say I agree with everything you said about Veritasium.\n that generally I can watch it and not have to wonder is he gonna mess up? No, he's brilliant. I'm excited about this bet because if I am wrong then I want to know like the whole point of the channel is\n to get to the truth and that is I think why we're all here today and I think you know this is great great chance to sort of see. I'm going to summarize Alex's main points in this video but I'll put his full presentation here. So let me first explain what I see in the\n the video. In the video the vehicle is operated in a gusty wind. Initially you have the wind speed exceeding the car speed, but then the wind speed is not constant. The wind speed drops and the car\n moves by inertia with deceleration for a while. So basically Alex thinks a gust pushes the car to a high speed and then when the wind dies the car is going faster than the wind momentarily, but it must be slowing down. In fact, that will be my conclusion at the end.\n of this presentation that whenever you have velocity faster than the wind, I'll actually show you in an equation, the acceleration is negative. The second effect is that the wind in the video is measured at the height of about a meter or meter and a half\n But the propeller goes to some three meters above the ground. Now due to interactions with the ground, there is a wind gradient. Wind travels slower, close to the ground, and then faster higher up. Now Alex estimated that the wind speed of the propeller might be 10 or 15 percent\n higher than at the telltale, so it's possible that the car could be moving slower than the wind at the propeller and yet appear to be moving faster than the wind at the height of the telltale. Now I think that this is a small effect, however in combination with the previous effect\n effect, it just can make this more frequent.\n higher than what is possible here unless the wind had picked up and then spontaneously sort of dropped? Very very good question. Okay, if you're going for the record you probably will do many attempts. You will be sampling that\n gust you wind over and over and over until you set the record. That's how you set the record. And on one of those occasions you will get a nice strong gust which is three times the air that comes after it. And that's when you will clock the record\n So what about the treadmill tests? These are conducted in still air. By moving the ground backwards, you're simulating a perfectly steady tailwind. And if you hold the car\n stationary on the treadmill, that's equivalent to the car going exactly wind speed. Now if the car can move forward on the treadmill, that shows it can accelerate faster than the wind. But Alex had multiple explanations\n why these experiments don't actually show what they claim to show.\n towards the desired result.\n Yeah, I'm sure, I'm 100% sure that the guy in the video doesn't do it on purpose. However, if he is expecting forward drift... Yeah, it's classic.\n In the absence of convincing experimental evidence, Alex turned to theoretical analyses, like one by MIT aero professor Mark Drela. But here, too, he found problems. His main concern\n is that the equation for net force includes the difference between the speeds of the car and the wind in the denominator, which seems to imply that when traveling exactly wind speed, you should get infinite force.\n If Derek drives very close to the wind, that difference in speed goes to zero. If it's one millionth of a one percent, that's like a nuclear bomb exploding behind him, then Derek is definitely in trouble.\n to find something to save Derek's life here. This is serious, right? Alex performed his own analysis and found no such divide by zero problems. In fact, he found there's no way for the cart\n to accelerate at or above wind speed.\n That is basically where we left it. So now it was up to me to convince Professor Kosenko that Blackbird really can go faster than the wind. But his presence\n The presentation was effective. When I posted about it on Twitter, Alice Zhang, who runs Chinese Veritasium, said, What's amazing to me is that neither one of them had seen my attempts to replicate the treadmill experiments.\n For the first video, I asked my friend and YouTube maker, Zyla Foxlin, to make a model downwind cart. Version 1 ended in failure, but Zyla was undeterred, coming back in a couple days\n Unlike these models, most of her projects actually work. She is determined. So maybe this tells us something about whether you can actually go faster than the wind downwind.\n What's clear to me is that I didn't do a good enough job in the first video explaining how Blackbird works and providing convincing evidence that it can really go faster than the wind in a sustained way. In my defense, I thought the concept was well enough established.\n In 1969, Andrew Bauer built the first successful downwind cart, and he did it to settle a friendly wager with aero engineer Apollo Smith. The bet was inspired by a claim in a student's paper from 20 years earlier.\n builder of Blackbird was completely unaware of all this until after he built his cart. But other analyses have been published under names like the Push Me Pull You Boat. So I didn't honestly think anyone would doubt the vehicle's operation, much less bet me $10,000\n dollars. But clearly there is a need for a deeper explanation. So I want to do that now by responding to the points Alex raised. So first let's deal with wind gradient. I mean why didn't we measure the speed of the wind higher up? Well the answer is because it's already\n been done. They mounted telltales on fishing poles out to the sides of the propeller and even above it. Now although the lowest telltale flips back first, all of the telltales do eventually flip backwards, showing that every part of the vehicle is going faster.\n Could this be because of a big wind gust that pushed the car up to high speed and then the wind died? I don't think so. Even though I didn't have a speedometer in the car for my runs, someone on Twitter pointed out that we could use the rotation of the back wheel to\n to determine the speed from the video footage. This shows that even after the telltale flips backwards, the car keeps accelerating. Another thing I want to point out is that if wind gradient or gusts were the reason that the car travels faster than the wind,\n Well, you'd expect the telltale to jump around or at least not point straight back at me. But it consistently does for over 30 seconds until I had to hit the brakes to avoid crashing into parked vehicles. But if that's not enough for you, when Blackbird achieves\n its record speed of 27.7 miles per hour in a 10 mile per hour tailwind, it was still accelerating. And we know this because there were multiple GPS units in the car and wind speeds which were measured at the height of the propeller at multiple\n locations. The highlighted section shows the 10-second measurement period over which the record was set. Also in 2013 the US Physics Olympiad semi-final exam asked questions about Blackbird like can it go faster than the wind downwind?\n and upwind. The solution says both modes are possible and with sufficiently low energy loss any speed is possible. Now I'll admit that the evidence I showed in the first video was not definitive.\n wind gusts or gradients could have explained the observations. But now that you've seen this evidence, are you convinced that Blackbird can go downwind faster than the wind without slowing down? Well, Professor Kosenko was not convinced.\n So I want to explain how the car works so clearly that no one, not even the professor, can doubt what's going on. The first thing to know is that the propeller doesn't work like most people think. It's not working like a windmill. It doesn't turn the way the tailwind is pushing it.\n Instead it turns in the opposite direction working like a fan to push air backwards. This fan is powered by the wheels which are connected to the propeller by a bike chain. So at wind speed the car can keep accelerating because the wheels turn the fan which blows\n air back, generating forward thrust. Now the big question is, to drive the fan there must be a backwards force on the wheels which tends to slow them down. So why isn't this force bigger than the thrust from the propeller causing the car to\n slowdown overall? Well the answer is the wheels are going so much faster over the ground than the propeller is moving through the air so the thrust force can actually be larger. I'm going to do an analysis in the frame of reference of the car and the important\n The equation to know is power equals force times velocity. So at the wheels, power is input into the system by the ground moving underneath the car. The power generated is the force of the ground on the wheels times the velocity of the car.\n At the propeller, work is done on the air as the propeller pushes it backwards. The power out equals the force of the prop on the air times the speed of the car minus the speed of the wind. The prop is going slower through the air due to\n to the tailwind. And if we assume no losses, then the power in at the wheels equals the power out at the propeller. From this equation, we can see that the force at the propeller will be greater than the force at the wheels. And since the propeller is pushing air\n back, the air applies an equal and opposite force forward on the prop. This is the thrust force, which will be greater than the backwards force on the wheels. So this car works like a lever,\n a pulley. By applying a small force to the wheels over a larger distance, the propeller can apply a larger force over a smaller distance. This is just like when you're riding a bike going uphill. You move the pedals fast, but with smaller force,\n to make the wheels move slower over the ground but with a bigger force. But now we've run into the divide by zero problem that Professor Kusenko warned us about. When the speed of the car is exactly equal to the speed of the wind, it seems like the propeller can provide\n infinite force? That can't be right, can it? I mean, is our analysis flawed? The answer is no for two reasons. First of all, this is exactly what you'd expect theoretically with any lever or pulley. If one arm of the lever is\n zero then you can lift an infinite weight with any amount of force on the other side. The catch is its displacement will be zero. Second of all, in practice there is a propeller efficiency term that is ill-defined when the propeller is not moving through\n the air. And then the divide by zero problem is eliminated. But that equation makes the\n problem look more complicated than it actually is. You don't actually need aerodynamics. Here I have a little cart with a big wheel that rolls on two smaller spools, and what I'm going to show is that when you have two media moving\n relative to one another well then if this car is in contact with both media it can actually move faster than their relative velocity so as I push the board to the right you can see that the car\n goes down the board faster than the board is moving. If you look carefully you'll see that the big wheel isn't turning the way that the board is pushing it, it's actually rotating in the opposite direction\n That's just like the propeller on Blackbird, which pushes back against the air and that's how it's able to go faster than the wind downwind. Now you can build one of these cars for yourself at home or\n Or you can build a model downwind cart. I told you Zyla was determined. Yeah, I'm gonna make the claim on camera. Like, I think it's gonna work this time. We're changing the propeller. It has to work before we get kicked out of the treadmill store.\n It totally works! Amazing! Oh my god!\n Her fourth version of the cart works spectacularly and it was designed to be replicated by anyone using just a 3d printer and a simple list of materials She explains how to build it with more details on the engineering process on a video over on her channel\n So go check it out. Now professor Kosenko has now conceded the bet and he transferred ten thousand dollars to me. So I want to thank him for being a man of honor and changing his mind in light of the evidence I presented, which is really not easy to do, especially\n in a public debate like this one. Now I do not want to keep the money, I want to invest it in science communication. So I'm holding a one-minute video competition. I'll be awarding cash prizes to the top three videos that explain\n counterintuitive STEM concept. I'll put some details down in the description. What I love about science is that disagreements are not problems. They are opportunities for everyone to learn something. I learned a lot more\n about Blackbird, aerodynamics, and gear ratios than I knew before. I also learned that I should go into more depth in my videos. I should make the evidence overwhelmingly convincing and put in some equations toward the end for those who want that level of detail. I want to thank everyone\n involved in the making of this video Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Sean Carroll, Mark Darella, Professor Kosenko, and Zyla Foxlin but especially Rick Cavallaro the inventor and creator of Blackbird he was a fountain of information a constant source of support\n and the man leading the charge to help people understand this area of physics for the past 15 years. Let's hope this video puts the issue to rest once and for all.\n All started with a brain teaser and this video is sponsored brilliant offers you a daily problem to solve every day like this one about gear ratios If the first gear spins 10 times per second at what rate does the final gear spin now? I did this problem the hard way, but my wife figured\n out how to do it the easy way. And that's what brain teasers are great for. They get you thinking about the world and they give you insights into problems you might think you already understand. Just think about how much more you would understand in a year if you got into the habit of solving one\n novel, unexpected problem per day. And while you're at it, why not take one of Brilliant's courses like on computer science, neural networks, or classical physics? Even physics professors can benefit from some lessons on frames of reference. Somehow, I managed to go my whole degree\n without learning Likranian mechanics, so that's a course I'm working through at the moment. It's a really elegant way of solving physics problems, and I wish I had learned about it sooner.

            "transcription": "Today I'm at the University of Sydney with Dr. Phil and we're talking about the pressure that all of us are under. You are under a lot of pressure, probably 10,000 kilograms. 10,000 kilograms is pressing in on my whole body. All from all sides. Where does all this pressure come from?\n from? It's from the air. That looks like a dance move. Is that what you pull out on the dance floor? I'm lifting 10,000 kilograms of air. You're lifting the air. How much air is there above us? About 20 kilometers or so. So you're at the bottom of an ocean of air.\n So essentially the weight of the air is squishing me in. That's right. And to all of us, you too. And me too. Wow. You seem to be holding up rather well though. Thank you, thank you. How do you do it? What is your secret? Well I've got this special trick. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I've got the same amount of pressure inside me.\n Okay, so since the pressure is equal inside and outside of you, you're in equilibrium and there's no sort of crushing or expansion. No, that's right. Okay, well most people I think don't recognize the pressure that they're under. Yeah. At least due to the\n atmosphere. That's right. How can we demonstrate that the atmosphere is exerting this huge pressure on everyone? The best thing to do is to scoop out their insides and then there'll be no pressure on the inside and then they'll be crushed by the atmosphere. By the atmosphere.\n And that will be a rather clear demonstration of the power of the atmosphere. But let's say we didn't want to kill anyone. How can we demonstrate this in say a lab? Well, we could take a model of a person. And this drum is meant to be a model of a person? That's correct.\n Okay, and so what are we gonna do with it? So what I'm gonna do Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna put some water in here. Why don't we go ahead and do it? Okay, let's do it Let it heating up\n We've got some water in the drum and we're heating it up on this little gas stove here. That's right. Okay. And what is that doing for us? So the water will heat up and begin to boil. So it'll turn from liquid into a vapor.\n that vapor will push out some of the air. Okay, so basically we're going to remove the air from inside the drum and replace it with water vapor. That's right. Okay. Okay, then once we're sure that it's pretty much emptied of air, we put the stopper in.\n and cool it back down again. Okay, so that's going to condense the water vapor. That's right. And so what does that do to the pressure inside the drum? It'll become much smaller. Okay, and then we're going to be able to see what the atmosphere does when there's no pressure on the inside.\n Push out. Exactly. Alright, well I'll look forward to that. Alright. So how long do we have to wait for this to boil and get all sorted? A couple of minutes. Should we do a little time lapse effect? Let's do that.\n Okay, looks like we're boiling away furiously here. Alright. Which is pretty good. So it's about time to perform the experiment. Let's do it. I bet it might be a bit dramatic so I'm going to chuck on a bit of gear. Safety glasses are always important. Yeah.\n gloves to avoid burning your hands on this very hot drum. That's right. Now you might want to... you want to put those on? I will. You might want to stand back a bit because it's a little bit dramatic what happens. Alright let's do it.\n Get the bin into there and get some cold water onto it. Alright, so that water's turning back into water.\n Oh my god!\n The car is now in the garage.\n That's what you look like with\n 3,000 kilograms on your head, 10,000 kilograms on your whole body. You know what I was expecting? I was expecting it to crumple like slowly over time. I wasn't expecting it to just go all in once. Yeah, well, because it's circular,\n little bit of it goes and the whole lot goes. Wow. They're quite, they're quite strong for a while. Yeah, that was awesome. You can hear the air is trying to get back in. And now the pressure is equalized.\n The pressure's now re-equalised, that's right. Wow, that's one hell of an experiment. It certainly is. Looks like you wet yourself, that was so exciting. That's partly true.\n you"

            "transcription": "Check this out. Isn't that awesome? That is hydrodynamic levitation. Check it out.\n This styrofoam ball is levitating on this stream of water and it's doing so in a very stable way. The setup is so stable you can play frisbee through it. Which is weird to me because\n because the water is off to one side of the ball and that doesn't seem to make any sense. You can block the water for a second and the ball will still levitate. Have a look. Isn't that cool?\n How can it be stable like this?\n How can this be a stable configuration? That is what we're going to explain. This is my friend Blake. He is a toy inventor and he actually came up with this and he brought it to me and I was like, that is awesome. There's some really cool physics going on here. Juggling with water.\n I can't believe it will just allow you to switch balls like that. They can even hit each other as they go down. So how does this effect work? Well, a lot of people might think of the hairdryer pink\n which works basically based on Bernoulli's principle. That's actually what we're showing here. We've brought this stream down so it's going at a very low velocity. So it's pretty much laminar flow. And what you can see if you look at the ball is it's entirely\n enclosed in water. So that water stream comes up, goes around the ball, and just as with the ping-pong ball, if it moves to one side of the stream, it slows down the flow of fluid. And according to Bernoulli's principle, this increases the pressure relative to the faster flowing fluid on the other side.\n other side so it pushes the ball back into the middle. That is what provides the stability for this ball but I think what we're seeing with the bigger balls is something different. This is the largest styrofoam ball I could find so I don't expect it to work but hey we're gonna give it a shot.\n Should I go higher? Oh! It's happening! That is incredible! Look at the dance on there, man!\n It's like, got this instability, but it corrects. It's incredible. You should see the way the water is spiraling off there. That is awesome.\n The film is set to be released on May 24, 2019.\n So I've been thinking a lot about the physics that makes this possible. What I think is happening is as the stream contacts the ball it pushes it up but it also pushes the ball out away from the stream. So what I think is remarkable is that the ball actually\n will stay there. It is in a stable configuration. And from looking at the high-speed footage, what I really think is going on is this water is getting thrown over and down by the ball. And since the ball is putting a force over and down\n down on the water, that water is putting a force up and in on the ball which keeps it right in that stream. It's because there's a bit of adhesion between the water here and the styrofoam. It starts to go a little slower. That pulls all that water over the ball. And that's the start of how\n you get the ball to spin and how you get that sprayed down on the right hand side which provides more lift and keeps forcing the ball back into the stream. Come on. Once the ball is levitating it remains stable\n Because if it drifts too far into the stream, that decreases the flow of water around the ball, reducing the force pushing it into the stream. And if it drifts too far out, that increases the water flow over the ball, increasing the force pushing it back into the stream.\n What makes the equilibrium position so stable? Any slight perturbation creates a restoring force that moves the ball back to equilibrium. The rotation I think is also nice because that gives it that angular momentum providing a little bit of stability side by side.\n so important for these balls, but it certainly is important for the disc. If you try to levitate a disc, you need to keep it in the right orientation. Oh, yes. Getting the disc\n to levitate is significantly harder than the balls, because they have to maintain their vertical orientation in order for this to work. Even a slight breeze makes this very difficult.\n Hey! Check that out! Can you come in and get it? Oh!\n Oh my goodness! This is a clear demonstration that that is not just about the Bernoulli effect, right? It's due to the rotation of the disc that actually carries the water over and sprays it down, which pushes that\n back into the stream. That was amazing! Not only is this an awesome experiment, it's also pretty fun to play around with in the summer and it was invented by my friend Blake. So come over to my channel and I'll show you how with the simple Home Depot run you can\n build this in your own backyard. I will put a link to that video right here.

            "transcription": "What would happen if you dropped a penny off the Empire State Building? Could it kill someone walking on the sidewalk below? What does it take to create a deadly projectile? Well, I'm going to put this to the test with original MythBuster Adam Savage.\n He's going up in a helicopter to throw pennies at me. No one hasn't heard that story. When you talk about it, people are like, oh yeah, the penny from the Empire State Building. And when we went to the Empire State Building, every ledge below the observation deck is filled with change.\n A penny weighs around 2.5 grams, which is about half to a quarter the weight of a bullet.\n If you ignore air resistance, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building, which is 443 meters to the very top, would accelerate to over 300 km per hour by the time it hits the ground. That's around half as fast as\n as a typical bullet. The Mythbusters made contraptions to shoot pennies at each other.\n But they never tried the ultimate test, dropping pennies from the height of the Empire State Building onto someone below. And that's what we're going to do here with Adam. That'd be great watching it bounce off your body. Yeah.\n Yeah. I say this thinking it's always been my body up till now. First, I'll drop the pennies. We'll see where you're going to land. You're going to walk there. I'll throw a second one that's good for you. Yeah. Then you're ready for the full dump. Yeah.\n I'm going underneath a helicopter\n I know I agreed to do this and I didn't think I'd get hurt, but as I'm walking out under the helicopter, I started to think...\n No one has actually done this. We planned for pennies falling through still air, but the helicopter creates a huge downdraft to support its weight.\n I start to imagine pennies gouging into my shoulders. You can see how tense my body looks.\n And three, two, one. Ah! That hit my shoulder. Ah!\n That's really good. And three, two, one! They feel like tiny little bullets. I feel like I'm gonna be bruised after this. Oh boy. Ah.\n Okay, lay down and go for it. Here we go, doing the whole thing in three, two, one.\n Yeah!\n Unbelievable! There you have it, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is not gonna hurt. I mean it hurts a little, but not a lot. You'll be alright.\n It stung to get hit by\n pennies falling that far, but it certainly wasn't fatal. So why aren't pennies more dangerous? Well the reason is air resistance.\n Take the classic experiment of a hammer and feather dropped simultaneously on the moon. In the near vacuum of the moon's surface, both objects speed up at the same rate due to the moon's gravity.\n and they're both still accelerating when they hit the ground at the same time. Repeat the experiment on Earth and of course the hammer lands way before the feather. If you watch the feather closely\n you'll notice that it doesn't speed up as it falls. For most of its journey, it's moving at a constant speed known as its terminal velocity. Terminal velocity is reached when the force of gravity pulling an object down is equal\n In this case, which object, the hammer or the feather, experiences a greater force of air resistance? Well, I bet most people would say the feather, because its motion is clearly affected by drag.\n But the answer is actually the hammer. Air resistance is proportional to speed squared, and the hammer gets going much faster than the feather, so it experiences the larger force of air resistance. But its weight is so much greater\n that drag is negligible in comparison and that's why the hammer keeps speeding up while the feather reaches terminal velocity early and just stays at that speed. It all comes down to the ratio of weight to air resistance.\n Every object has its own terminal velocity, the maximum speed it will reach in free fall through still air. And I went indoor skydiving to experience this firsthand.\n That was so amazing! That was totally wild! Objects that have the same size and shape experience the same air resistance, but if one is heavier\n Here I've got two identical balls, but this one has water added to it so it's heavier. Then it has a higher terminal velocity so it doesn't float at the same wind speed as the lighter object. Conversely, some objects\n are very different in size and shape, like a person and a lacrosse ball, and obviously they have very different weights, but they also experience very different forces of air resistance. And the key thing is that the ratio of their weight to\n air resistance is the same for both bodies so they have the same terminal velocity which means they will both float together in the tunnel. If you transported the skydiver and lacrosse ball to the stratosphere they would continue to fall\n together, but their joint terminal velocity would be much faster. In 2012, Felix Baumgartner jumped from a helium balloon 39 kilometers above sea level. After just 40 seconds of freefall, he reached a terminal\n velocity over 1300 kmh. It was 25% faster than the speed of sound, making him the first person to break the sound barrier outside of a vehicle. What allowed him to do this was the lack of air at that altitude.\n Air resistance is directly proportional to the density of air you're moving through, and at that altitude, the air is 60 times less dense than at sea level. As he continued falling into thicker atmosphere, the increasing air density reduced his\n Now, rain also falls kilometers, but through the thicker air of the troposphere,\n One of the coolest things in the wind tunnel was to see water floating. Poured from a jug, it quickly breaks up into droplets the same size as raindrops, from around 0.5 to 4 millimeters in diameter.\n And standing there, you can experience what it would be like to fall with raindrops. They have a low terminal velocity of just\n That's what the wind speed was set to for this demonstration. And what you can see is that raindrops aren't shaped like cartoon raindrops. They are closer to spherical, but a bit flatter on the bottom.\n If a raindrop gets too big, it flattens out, caves in in the middle, and briefly resembles a little parachute before breaking up into smaller droplets. So raindrops aren't damaging. But it's not.\n It's a different story for Hale. Every year in the US, Hale injures around 20 people, and since 2000, it's caused four fatalities. That's because Hale\n can reach terminal velocities of over 200 km per hour. That's around 10 times the terminal velocity of rain. But why is its terminal velocity so much higher, even though ice itself is slightly less dense than liquid water?\n The main thing is that hail can get much bigger than a raindrop. Hail stones have been measured up to 20 centimeters in diameter. Now, drag is proportional to cross-sectional area, so it scales with radius squared.\n whereas weight scales with radius cubed. So the bigger the hailstone, the faster its terminal velocity. It also has more mass, so it carries even more kinetic energy and packs a bigger punch when it hits something.\n Pennies reach terminal velocity after falling only around 15 meters. You can see in this shot the average speed of the pennies in the top of the frame is the same as at the bottom of the frame. They aren't speeding up, they've reached terminal velocity.\n So it wouldn't matter if pennies were dropped on you from 15 meters or 300 meters or 3,000 meters, it would feel the same because they would be going the same speed. In fact, we didn't take the helicopter all the way up to Empire State.\n building height, because that wouldn't have increased the speed of the pennies at all, and it would have just made aiming much harder.\n One of the reasons pennies are so hard to aim is because they flutter and tumble as they fall. This tumbling behavior\n means pennies don't actually have a single terminal velocity.\n I gotta see that. Yeah, that's really neat. Throw to them! Adam built a custom wind tunnel to witness this for himself. So I went to San Francisco to his cave to check it out. This is literally like my MythBusters origin story, this device.\n I'm so delighted to fire this up again. It's like looking at a piece of history. How old is this? 19 years old now. It's old enough to drive and vote, but not during. There's people watching this video, you know, who weren't alive when you were making this.\n Because of the holes, which allow air to escape, this wind tunnel has a gradient of wind speeds from around 100 km per hour at the bottom up to 25 km per hour at the top. This creates a little bit of back pressure that pops the tongue to press.\n pressures up here and that back pressure is relieved by these holes enough so that the penny spins. If a penny really has two different terminal velocities it should oscillate up and down in this wind tunnel as a result.\n That's amazing to see it oscillate, right? I know! The fact that it goes up and down and then comes back up again. Yeah! Oh wow! Yeah! It was just like on it's flat face. It was just hanging out like that.\n When in 2003 I dropped the penny in the top and it went up and down like I'm still every single time I tell that story I get goosebumps because I remember that feeling of like, oh wow. We made a separate video on Adam's channel that discusses the\n wind tunnel in more detail, so check it out after this. So the reason pennies aren't dangerous is because their terminal velocity is at most about 80 kilometers per hour. Yeah, it's not gonna hurt you. That's busted. Right.\n But something more aerodynamic would have a higher terminal velocity, and this has led some to suggest ballpoint pens falling from a skyscraper like the Empire State Building\n could be lethal.\n weigh about twice as much as a penny and they have a smaller cross-sectional area. So this will increase the ratio of weight to drag, but will it be enough?\n Now because I'm not sure what will happen, I'm not putting my body on the line for this one. Instead, we'll use a ballistics gel dummy. Here we go! And three, two, one! Oh, that's very close. Back up again.\n Oh, very close, very close. Here we go. Three, two, one. Oh, oh, almost. Okay. Three, two, one.\n Almost! Three, two, one! Okay, last one. Three, two, one! Almost! We did not get an end.\n The second to last drop we had almost no crosswinds at all so they dropped perfectly down and kind of hit\n right below where we were and they were all cattywampas. If the myth was true, I would expect to see this everywhere. Right. Right. That's what I would expect to see. And I don't see a single one\n Narrow metal pens\n might still be dangerous, but these plastic ones still seem to have too much drag relative to their weight for them to achieve a high terminal velocity. One of the curious things about air resistance is that it depends not only on the cross-sectional area of the object, but also\n on its overall shape. This dependence is captured in a dimensionless number known as the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is all about how smoothly air can flow around an object, without creating vortices.\n The word bullet comes from the French boule, meaning ball. So a boulette is a small ball, exactly what the earliest bullets were. But the drag coefficient of a sphere is 0.5, so people modify\n the shape to reduce drag, and eventually they settled on the modern bullet shape, which has a drag coefficient between 0.1 and 0.3. So drag coefficient is the reason a bullet is no longer a boullette.\n What would happen if you dropped a bullet from a skyscraper? Not what you'd expect. Instead of falling pointy side down, a bullet would tumble and likely end up falling on its side.\n have given enough chance. Really? But the object falls in relation to the highest resistance. It chooses, it ends up finding the highest resistance as the most stable. Why? Why doesn't it fall on lowest resistance? I know. That seems intuitive. Bullets, if you let them, they'll fall and make\n A bullet fired straight up slows down as its kinetic energy is turned into gravitational energy. And at its highest point, which could be up to 3km high, it stops and then\n falls back down. At that moment, it's just like dropping a bullet from a really tall building. As it starts to fall, it will tumble, and so it experiences far more air resistance than on the way up, and so it's not going to get back a lot of that energy\n that went into its height, which means that by the time it reaches the ground, it will be much slower than it was shot. Now, if the bullet isn't fired completely vertical, then it poses much greater danger. At the peak of its trajectory,\n only the vertical component of velocity is zero. It still maintains its horizontal velocity. And that, combined with the spin imparted to the bullet by the grooves inside the gun barrel, keep it moving pointy end forwards. And so as the bullet comes back\n back to the ground, it speeds up to a significant fraction of its launch speed. There are hundreds of cases of people being struck and killed by celebratory gunfire from all over the world.\n Now, this is accidental, but the concept of dropping deadly projectiles on enemies is almost as old as aircraft. In World War I, these little pieces of metal were dropped out of planes, and they look like nails with little feathers on the back to make sure they fall straight.\n called flechettes, which is French for little arrow, but somewhere up to 15 centimeters long.\n From a military perspective, the advantages were they didn't require any explosives, and they were cheap to produce and deploy at scale. They could pierce helmets, leading to enemy casualties and some nasty injuries.\n I found darts that had gone through a rider and his horse. That's insane. But I also just love the idea of a guy in an open cockpit, cloth and wood plane, just hurling handfuls of darts out. That is like a 10 year old's idea of warfare. Right?\n Later, the US created similar weapons called lazy dogs, which were a bit heftier, used in the Korean and Vietnam wars. The damage they inflicted was indiscriminate and unpredictable, but at least they didn't leave unexploded ordinances\n in the field. And militaries continue to use kinetic projectiles to this day, for example to make precision strikes on terrorist leaders. Falling objects are also dangerous in civilian life. Nearly 700 Americans die each year by being struck by a falling object. These\n range from loose tiles and bricks to falling construction tools, falling rocks and tree branches, and even icicles. Death by icicle is rare, but they were a serious enough concern that in the winter of 2014, streets around New York's One World Trade Center were closed due to the danger\n caused by icicles hanging on the building. So which projectiles are lethal and which aren't? Honestly, a lot of them are. The lower limit of the energy required to fracture a human skull is around 68 joules, so anything that has kinetic energy greater than that is very low.\n likely to kill you. A raindrop at terminal velocity with its tiny mass will only deliver two thousandths of a joule. A falling penny has about a fifth of a joule. But a baseball and the largest hailstone measure deliver more than 80 joules. That is,\n In 2014, a man was killed when he was hit by a falling measuring tape that had fallen 50 stories. And this is just calculating for blunt force trauma. The energy stored in a falling flashe is not enough to crack your skull, but it can apply to the body.\n apply a large force to a very small area. So yeah, a penny falling from the Empire State Building won't kill you. A pen likely won't either. Anything that weighs a few grams and isn't aerodynamic isn't going to be fatal.

            "transcription": "What would happen if you dropped a penny off the Empire State Building? Could it kill someone walking on the sidewalk below? What does it take to create a deadly projectile? Well, I'm going to put this to the test with original MythBuster Adam Savage.\n He's going up in a helicopter to throw pennies at me. No one hasn't heard that story. When you talk about it, people are like, oh yeah, the penny from the Empire State Building. And when we went to the Empire State Building, every ledge below the observation deck is filled with change.\n A penny weighs around 2.5 grams, which is about half to a quarter the weight of a bullet.\n If you ignore air resistance, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building, which is 443 meters to the very top, would accelerate to over 300 km per hour by the time it hits the ground. That's around half as fast as\n as a typical bullet. The Mythbusters made contraptions to shoot pennies at each other.\n But they never tried the ultimate test, dropping pennies from the height of the Empire State Building onto someone below. And that's what we're going to do here with Adam. That'd be great watching it bounce off your body. Yeah.\n Yeah. I say this thinking it's always been my body up till now. First, I'll drop the pennies. We'll see where you're going to land. You're going to walk there. I'll throw a second one that's good for you. Yeah. Then you're ready for the full dump. Yeah.\n I'm going underneath a helicopter\n I know I agreed to do this and I didn't think I'd get hurt, but as I'm walking out under the helicopter, I started to think...\n No one has actually done this. We planned for pennies falling through still air, but the helicopter creates a huge downdraft to support its weight.\n I start to imagine pennies gouging into my shoulders. You can see how tense my body looks.\n And three, two, one. Ah! That hit my shoulder. Ah!\n That's really good. And three, two, one! They feel like tiny little bullets. I feel like I'm gonna be bruised after this. Oh boy. Ah.\n Okay, lay down and go for it. Here we go, doing the whole thing in three, two, one.\n Yeah!\n Unbelievable! There you have it, a penny dropped from the Empire State Building is not gonna hurt. I mean it hurts a little, but not a lot. You'll be alright.\n It stung to get hit by\n pennies falling that far, but it certainly wasn't fatal. So why aren't pennies more dangerous? Well the reason is air resistance.\n Take the classic experiment of a hammer and feather dropped simultaneously on the moon. In the near vacuum of the moon's surface, both objects speed up at the same rate due to the moon's gravity.\n and they're both still accelerating when they hit the ground at the same time. Repeat the experiment on Earth and of course the hammer lands way before the feather. If you watch the feather closely\n you'll notice that it doesn't speed up as it falls. For most of its journey, it's moving at a constant speed known as its terminal velocity. Terminal velocity is reached when the force of gravity pulling an object down is equal\n In this case, which object, the hammer or the feather, experiences a greater force of air resistance? Well, I bet most people would say the feather, because its motion is clearly affected by drag.\n But the answer is actually the hammer. Air resistance is proportional to speed squared, and the hammer gets going much faster than the feather, so it experiences the larger force of air resistance. But its weight is so much greater\n that drag is negligible in comparison and that's why the hammer keeps speeding up while the feather reaches terminal velocity early and just stays at that speed. It all comes down to the ratio of weight to air resistance.\n Every object has its own terminal velocity, the maximum speed it will reach in free fall through still air. And I went indoor skydiving to experience this firsthand.\n That was so amazing! That was totally wild! Objects that have the same size and shape experience the same air resistance, but if one is heavier\n Here I've got two identical balls, but this one has water added to it so it's heavier. Then it has a higher terminal velocity so it doesn't float at the same wind speed as the lighter object. Conversely, some objects\n are very different in size and shape, like a person and a lacrosse ball, and obviously they have very different weights, but they also experience very different forces of air resistance. And the key thing is that the ratio of their weight to\n air resistance is the same for both bodies so they have the same terminal velocity which means they will both float together in the tunnel. If you transported the skydiver and lacrosse ball to the stratosphere they would continue to fall\n together, but their joint terminal velocity would be much faster. In 2012, Felix Baumgartner jumped from a helium balloon 39 kilometers above sea level. After just 40 seconds of freefall, he reached a terminal\n velocity over 1300 kmh. It was 25% faster than the speed of sound, making him the first person to break the sound barrier outside of a vehicle. What allowed him to do this was the lack of air at that altitude.\n Air resistance is directly proportional to the density of air you're moving through, and at that altitude, the air is 60 times less dense than at sea level. As he continued falling into thicker atmosphere, the increasing air density reduced his\n Now, rain also falls kilometers, but through the thicker air of the troposphere,\n One of the coolest things in the wind tunnel was to see water floating. Poured from a jug, it quickly breaks up into droplets the same size as raindrops, from around 0.5 to 4 millimeters in diameter.\n And standing there, you can experience what it would be like to fall with raindrops. They have a low terminal velocity of just\n That's what the wind speed was set to for this demonstration. And what you can see is that raindrops aren't shaped like cartoon raindrops. They are closer to spherical, but a bit flatter on the bottom.\n If a raindrop gets too big, it flattens out, caves in in the middle, and briefly resembles a little parachute before breaking up into smaller droplets. So raindrops aren't damaging. But it's not.\n It's a different story for Hale. Every year in the US, Hale injures around 20 people, and since 2000, it's caused four fatalities. That's because Hale\n can reach terminal velocities of over 200 km per hour. That's around 10 times the terminal velocity of rain. But why is its terminal velocity so much higher, even though ice itself is slightly less dense than liquid water?\n The main thing is that hail can get much bigger than a raindrop. Hail stones have been measured up to 20 centimeters in diameter. Now, drag is proportional to cross-sectional area, so it scales with radius squared.\n whereas weight scales with radius cubed. So the bigger the hailstone, the faster its terminal velocity. It also has more mass, so it carries even more kinetic energy and packs a bigger punch when it hits something.\n Pennies reach terminal velocity after falling only around 15 meters. You can see in this shot the average speed of the pennies in the top of the frame is the same as at the bottom of the frame. They aren't speeding up, they've reached terminal velocity.\n So it wouldn't matter if pennies were dropped on you from 15 meters or 300 meters or 3,000 meters, it would feel the same because they would be going the same speed. In fact, we didn't take the helicopter all the way up to Empire State.\n building height, because that wouldn't have increased the speed of the pennies at all, and it would have just made aiming much harder.\n One of the reasons pennies are so hard to aim is because they flutter and tumble as they fall. This tumbling behavior\n means pennies don't actually have a single terminal velocity.\n I gotta see that. Yeah, that's really neat. Throw to them! Adam built a custom wind tunnel to witness this for himself. So I went to San Francisco to his cave to check it out. This is literally like my MythBusters origin story, this device.\n I'm so delighted to fire this up again. It's like looking at a piece of history. How old is this? 19 years old now. It's old enough to drive and vote, but not during. There's people watching this video, you know, who weren't alive when you were making this.\n Because of the holes, which allow air to escape, this wind tunnel has a gradient of wind speeds from around 100 km per hour at the bottom up to 25 km per hour at the top. This creates a little bit of back pressure that pops the tongue to press.\n pressures up here and that back pressure is relieved by these holes enough so that the penny spins. If a penny really has two different terminal velocities it should oscillate up and down in this wind tunnel as a result.\n That's amazing to see it oscillate, right? I know! The fact that it goes up and down and then comes back up again. Yeah! Oh wow! Yeah! It was just like on it's flat face. It was just hanging out like that.\n When in 2003 I dropped the penny in the top and it went up and down like I'm still every single time I tell that story I get goosebumps because I remember that feeling of like, oh wow. We made a separate video on Adam's channel that discusses the\n wind tunnel in more detail, so check it out after this. So the reason pennies aren't dangerous is because their terminal velocity is at most about 80 kilometers per hour. Yeah, it's not gonna hurt you. That's busted. Right.\n But something more aerodynamic would have a higher terminal velocity, and this has led some to suggest ballpoint pens falling from a skyscraper like the Empire State Building\n could be lethal.\n weigh about twice as much as a penny and they have a smaller cross-sectional area. So this will increase the ratio of weight to drag, but will it be enough?\n Now because I'm not sure what will happen, I'm not putting my body on the line for this one. Instead, we'll use a ballistics gel dummy. Here we go! And three, two, one! Oh, that's very close. Back up again.\n Oh, very close, very close. Here we go. Three, two, one. Oh, oh, almost. Okay. Three, two, one.\n Almost! Three, two, one! Okay, last one. Three, two, one! Almost! We did not get an end.\n The second to last drop we had almost no crosswinds at all so they dropped perfectly down and kind of hit\n right below where we were and they were all cattywampas. If the myth was true, I would expect to see this everywhere. Right. Right. That's what I would expect to see. And I don't see a single one\n Narrow metal pens\n might still be dangerous, but these plastic ones still seem to have too much drag relative to their weight for them to achieve a high terminal velocity. One of the curious things about air resistance is that it depends not only on the cross-sectional area of the object, but also\n on its overall shape. This dependence is captured in a dimensionless number known as the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is all about how smoothly air can flow around an object, without creating vortices.\n The word bullet comes from the French boule, meaning ball. So a boulette is a small ball, exactly what the earliest bullets were. But the drag coefficient of a sphere is 0.5, so people modify\n the shape to reduce drag, and eventually they settled on the modern bullet shape, which has a drag coefficient between 0.1 and 0.3. So drag coefficient is the reason a bullet is no longer a boullette.\n What would happen if you dropped a bullet from a skyscraper? Not what you'd expect. Instead of falling pointy side down, a bullet would tumble and likely end up falling on its side.\n have given enough chance. Really? But the object falls in relation to the highest resistance. It chooses, it ends up finding the highest resistance as the most stable. Why? Why doesn't it fall on lowest resistance? I know. That seems intuitive. Bullets, if you let them, they'll fall and make\n A bullet fired straight up slows down as its kinetic energy is turned into gravitational energy. And at its highest point, which could be up to 3km high, it stops and then\n falls back down. At that moment, it's just like dropping a bullet from a really tall building. As it starts to fall, it will tumble, and so it experiences far more air resistance than on the way up, and so it's not going to get back a lot of that energy\n that went into its height, which means that by the time it reaches the ground, it will be much slower than it was shot. Now, if the bullet isn't fired completely vertical, then it poses much greater danger. At the peak of its trajectory,\n only the vertical component of velocity is zero. It still maintains its horizontal velocity. And that, combined with the spin imparted to the bullet by the grooves inside the gun barrel, keep it moving pointy end forwards. And so as the bullet comes back\n back to the ground, it speeds up to a significant fraction of its launch speed. There are hundreds of cases of people being struck and killed by celebratory gunfire from all over the world.\n Now, this is accidental, but the concept of dropping deadly projectiles on enemies is almost as old as aircraft. In World War I, these little pieces of metal were dropped out of planes, and they look like nails with little feathers on the back to make sure they fall straight.\n called flechettes, which is French for little arrow, but somewhere up to 15 centimeters long.\n From a military perspective, the advantages were they didn't require any explosives, and they were cheap to produce and deploy at scale. They could pierce helmets, leading to enemy casualties and some nasty injuries.\n I found darts that had gone through a rider and his horse. That's insane. But I also just love the idea of a guy in an open cockpit, cloth and wood plane, just hurling handfuls of darts out. That is like a 10 year old's idea of warfare. Right?\n Later, the US created similar weapons called lazy dogs, which were a bit heftier, used in the Korean and Vietnam wars. The damage they inflicted was indiscriminate and unpredictable, but at least they didn't leave unexploded ordinances\n in the field. And militaries continue to use kinetic projectiles to this day, for example to make precision strikes on terrorist leaders. Falling objects are also dangerous in civilian life. Nearly 700 Americans die each year by being struck by a falling object. These\n range from loose tiles and bricks to falling construction tools, falling rocks and tree branches, and even icicles. Death by icicle is rare, but they were a serious enough concern that in the winter of 2014, streets around New York's One World Trade Center were closed due to the danger\n caused by icicles hanging on the building. So which projectiles are lethal and which aren't? Honestly, a lot of them are. The lower limit of the energy required to fracture a human skull is around 68 joules, so anything that has kinetic energy greater than that is very low.\n likely to kill you. A raindrop at terminal velocity with its tiny mass will only deliver two thousandths of a joule. A falling penny has about a fifth of a joule. But a baseball and the largest hailstone measure deliver more than 80 joules. That is,\n In 2014, a man was killed when he was hit by a falling measuring tape that had fallen 50 stories. And this is just calculating for blunt force trauma. The energy stored in a falling flashe is not enough to crack your skull, but it can apply to the body.\n apply a large force to a very small area. So yeah, a penny falling from the Empire State Building won't kill you. A pen likely won't either. Anything that weighs a few grams and isn't aerodynamic isn't going to be fatal. But objects that weigh more than a few\n 100 grams traveling at terminal velocity are likely to be deadly.\n You like learning stuff, and I want to tell you one thing that will help you learn even more.

            "transcription": "Can we really touch something so that I can't touch the camera? The question of can we really touch something is a great one. Well let's say we have two electrons. I imagine what we mean by touching is that they come in and they actually physically\n touch. Now one of the problems is an electron actually has zero size as far as we can tell, no volume, so these would be infinitely scaled up. So how do the electrons actually interact with each other? Well they interact by exchanging a\n In the case of the electrons, it's a photon that they exchange. So as they come in, a photon is passed from one to the other, which changes the momentum of both of them and pushes them off. So they never really have to touch in order to interact with each other, to exchange\n that particle and therefore change their momentum and change directions experience a force. So I guess what do we mean by touching something? Every time we touch something we are exchanging force carrying particles with it. And that is touching. If photons are both\n quanta of light and the force carriers of the electromagnetic force does that mean that photons propagate magnetic fields and if so why can't these photons be seen? That's because the photons are not real photons they're virtual.\n Now this is a bit of a problematic topic and one which I hope to address in detail in a coming episode. The basic idea with virtual particles is you can't detect them. They're particles that are there but you cannot directly detect them and they may not obey\n all of the laws that we force real particles to adhere to. For example, there's the Einstein energy momentum relation E squared equals m naught c squared squared plus p squared c squared and a virtual particle doesn't necessarily need to obey this\n equation. So you can't really detect it because if you did it would have to be a real particle and then you can't disobey those equations like that. So this is something that I will delve into in a future episode. Who are your top three most inspirational scientists? I'm gonna take Einstein\n Feynman and Tesla. Who are your most inspirational scientists? Hey Derek, I guess a question that's been on the minds of a lot of us for a while now is who would win a chin-up competition between you and Henry from MinutePhysics?\n Now I wish this was a hypothetical, but we actually did this on the tube in London, so roll the tape.\n Oh man! This is impressive. You can pull up like this. It's so inspirational. You've got to do that.\n I thought it would be Henry that guy is ripped.\n In school, they say atoms want to have their outermost electron shells full and will willingly become ions in order to achieve that. Well, why? And why do the shells have the electron holding capacity of 2, 8, 18, and 32?\n and so on specifically. Let me deal with the electron shells first. See, if you accept that electrons are not only particles but also waves, then if they are waves bounded to a nucleus, that means that they must be\n standing waves. So you may be used to standing waves on a string, they don't seem to move anywhere, they just wiggle back and forth, or you can have standing waves in two dimensions on a plate. And what you notice is that these standing waves take on particular stable patterns. So bound\n These electrons are just standing waves in three dimensions, and the mathematical solutions are called the spherical harmonics. Because of the number of stable configurations you can have with growing amounts of angular momentum, there are different amounts of electrons which can fit into\n every state.\n to say vibrations in a plate. So why do atoms want the outer electron shell to be full? Well this kind of minimizes the energy state of the whole system. So let's say you had two atoms, if you actually remove the electron off one\n atom and stuck it in the other so that they both now had full shells, you would find that the total energy is now lower than it was before when the electrons were in their previous configurations. So the point is it's just like a ball rolling down a hill. It's that\n everything in nature wants to go to the lowest energy state. Why are the available frequencies of light continuous? I keep hearing that atoms absorb and emit photons of particular frequencies which correspond to the energy levels of their electrons.\n So where do all the other colors come from? Okay, it's true that atoms emit particular colors due to electrons jumping between certain allowed orbits around them. But we get different frequencies of light when these atoms bind up into molecules.\n molecules, or even solids, or when they form plasmas because then the charges are flying around all over the place. And in those cases, there's no longer these clearly defined energy levels for the electrons where they can jump and only produce certain distinct colors. Then there are a whole band\n of electron energy levels so we can get a real range of colors. So that's what we see from the sun or from hot solids. So that's why we get a continuous range of frequencies because the electron bands of energy allow virtually any transition.

It is Richard Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene.\n I read this a few years ago and I found it really enlightening, but I have a bit of a spoiler alert. Well, not really a spoiler, more of a clarification on the title. I mean, it sounds like a book about a gene for being selfish, but that's not what it's actually\n about. What it's about is the fact that genes themselves act in selfish ways.

As it condenses it's going to create a vacuum in there which hopefully will get it to implode.\n Oh yeah!\n The last one!\n you\n A lot of people think this experiment is just about showing the power of the atmosphere, but I think there's a more important consequence.

That feels good.\n Now you may have noticed that the big\n drum crumpled into an equilateral prism whereas the smaller drum crumpled into something resembling a hexagon. So the question is why would they crumple in different ways? I mean one thing I was thinking was that perhaps they were created in different ways\n So maybe they were welded in different points and that explains the structure that we saw. But I'd like to hear your thoughts. Why do you think we saw these different crumpling patterns? I mean obviously things with three corners are generally quite stable, so that may explain\n and also why it crumpled just to a triangular prism. But I'd like to hear what you have to say, so let me know in the comments."

I have the two 1.5 kilogram masses separated by a copper wire and my housemate and assistant Colette has the two 1.5 kilogram weights separated by some fishing line.\n They're both the same thickness, so we're going to put them on simultaneously and see how they go in cutting through the ice. How's yours?\n She cures the tip in a combo lamp for 60 seconds.\n Alright, we're roughly halfway through the experiment but I ran into trouble. The copper wire actually pulled out of these weights and so they fell to the ground. At this point it looks like the copper\n was doing slightly better than the fishing wire, but I've had to rig up a new copper, and so I'm going to try it in a different spot and let this new copper compete. I also scraped off the insulation, there was some enamel\n coating on the copper wire. So I've scraped that off so it should just be straight copper wire now. So let's see how it performs.\n Alright, it's half past one, but it looks like the experience\n The experiment is over and we have a winner. A copper wire pulled clean through the block of ice while the fishing line is still stuck in there. So why was that? Why is the copper better able to pass through this ice block than the fishing line?\n may have something to do with thermal conductivity. The copper is a better conductor of heat than the fishing line. That's important because as the wire passes through the ice refreezes once the wire has passed and that releases heat.\n If that heat is transferred quickly, it passes to the ice below, melting it and allowing the wire to move further and faster. Now, regulation is not just some abstract, useless scientific concept. Every time you make a snowball,\n you compress those ice crystals of the snow. And when you compress it, it melts a bit, turning into water. But as you release the pressure, it refreezes. So what we've made is a snowball. Think about that next time you have\n in a snow fight."

What's your personal best? The high jump. Two minutes 22. That's pretty high.\n record is Sotomayor from Cuba. It's about this high, eight foot and a half an inch, 245. Same height as a full men's volleyball net. Can you tell me about what it's like\n to be a high jumper. It's just really fun. Like everyone who sees it I know always wants to do it right? Yeah exactly. So can you teach me to jump as high\n is you? I don't know. He knows that he can't. Tell me about the technique that all the modern high jumpers use. So they do the Fosby Flop so that's with the J curved run up. Generally you have a straight\n and then the last part of the run up is curved. So it's half straight, half curved? Yeah, so that you can have more speed and it puts you in the right position to then get the rotation and it's\n and go over on your back. And what foot do you take off on? You take off on your left foot. Yeah, yeah, that's right. You can only really think about one thing. Drive up that leg. Tell people to drive up that leg.\n So what did I do wrong there? Wow, how much time do we have? You started on the wrong foot, come on you can get this. So before the Fosbury flop, the main technique that people\n we used was a straddle? Yeah, the straddle or I think it was also known as the western roll. With that technique athletes came on a much sharper angle to the bar in a straight line and they took off from their leg closest to\n to the bar and they went over the bar on their front. They still required some sort of mats for the straddle but I'll show you a scissor. That was another one that was from the days when you had to land on your feet.\n days of sawdust so I think that was more like before the 50s. Pretty much the same as the takeoff to Fosby Flot. And then you just land on your feet. Yeah you land on your feet.\n It's a really old one and it's what they did when they didn't have any mats. So really adding the mat really changed the way people jumped? Yeah, yeah and obviously without having to worry about landing safely they could they could jump higher. Regretting the the physics of it why\n Why is the Fosbury Flop the superior technique? Well... I've heard that it allows your center of mass to actually pass underneath the bar. Your entire body clears the bar, but not all at once.\n keeping your legs and your arms sort of underneath the bar. If you average where your center of mass is, it's under the bar. Whereas the other techniques, they seem to, you have to have your whole center of mass clean in the bar. So technically it's harder, like you're getting your mass up higher.\n in order to clear the bar. Yeah, that would make sense because with the straddle technique when you go over you've got half your body going over the bar all at once. Whereas in the flop my coach used to talk about it like a hose.\n So the water coming out of our hose, you only need to get each bit above the bar at the right time as opposed to all of it at once.\n The film, which was first released in January, was a follow-up to the original film, and it was a hit\n The film is set to be released on May 24, 2019.\n \u1794\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2\u17d2"

Let's make sure that's not just a fluke. I'll try it again. So putting my finger on the O.\n And I see only O's. Well, let's try putting my finger on the X and see what we see then. And we see only X's.\n So, why is that? Why do you only see the label of the side that you press? Well, I don't want to tell you the answer right away. You could Google it, but I don't think that would be very satisfying. So, I think the best way would be to go down to your local hardware shop, pick\n up a bit of an electrical conduit and cut it into various lengths. Now to help you out I have made a shorter length of tubing with the same markings on it so let's give that one a try and see how it compares. So first I'll press on\n the O. We see three O's when I do it like that. But you don't see the X's. Yeah. But if you put your finger on the X to start with, then you see three X's. That's interesting.

So, you know, subscribe and you'll find out why this happens.\n So normally when I'm filming my videos I have to approach people and ask them to talk to me about physics. But while I was filming the spinning tube trick, a few kids came up to me and wanted to see what I was doing. And we got to discussing how the trick works and one of the kids suggested\n that I try spinning the tube on a glass table. Now a glass table is beyond the budget of Veritasium, but a piece of glass resting precariously on the backs of two chairs? That I think I can manage.\n still see the X's. I reckon you still see the X's. This is the next video. We need to do it. Now instead of saving this for another episode, I thought I would do it right now and that\n That way you may have a little bit more evidence to figure out how the trick is working. So I'm going to place the tube on the glass surface and I'm going to press down on the X and I want you to make a prediction. If we look from the underside, from underneath the glass, what will we see?\n Will we see an O like the student thought? Will we see an X like I said we would? Will we see both the X and the O? Or will we see neither? So I want you to make a prediction now. Click on one of the annotations.\n If you're watching on YouTube, if you're watching on a mobile device, I'll put the link in the description so hopefully you can check that out.

The invisible vapors of isopropyl alcohol and the plume of ejected material when you sneeze.\n This is the setup for how I made those shots. Over here I have a 40 centimeter diameter concave parabolic mirror. Normally this would be used to make a telescope, but if it formed just a tiny piece of a big spherical\n shell, right? A giant spherical mirror that we're inside. Then the center of that mirror would be right here. And that's where I've placed this LED. It's three millimeter, but I tried to make the light source even smaller by painting it with some black nail\n polish so we try to approximate a point source of light there. Now that light spreads out in all directions and it bounces off the mirror and reflects back almost to exactly the point where the light is. You can see that the light\n converges to a point right there. Now I've offset the light just a little bit so that this light will pass straight through and into the lens of my camera. So right here I position this razor blade so it cuts off\n About half the light passing through. This setup allows you to see tiny variations in what is in front of the mirror. For example, when you have hot gases coming off of a candle, well, you can see that because as the reflection\n When reflected light from the LED passes through this column of hot air, it changes directions ever so slightly, that is, it refracts. And the reason for that is because the refractive index of hot air is different from the refractive index of the cooler air around.\n Refractive index is a measure of how fast light travels through a medium relative to its speed in a vacuum. For air, the value is pretty close to 1, but hotter air actually has a lower index of refraction. In this case, the difference in refraction is that\n index is incredibly tiny and so we don't notice the deflection of the light. But with this setup it actually makes a difference because some of the light that would have passed over this razor blade instead gets deflected down and gets blocked and that forms a darker spot on the image.\n Similarly, some light that would have hit the razor blade is instead deflected over it creating a brighter spot on the image. And that is how this works. So you can see the heat rising off your head. And you can see your breath.\n And you can see the cold air poured out of a cup of ice But temperature is not the only thing that affects the refractive index different materials different substances they have different refractive index\n For example, the butane in a lighter. Obviously we can't see that it's coming out right now, but the camera can, even before the lighter is lit.\n Light also refracts when it passes through\n bubble, and the amount depends on the thickness of that bubble film.\n This technique is known as Schlieren, based on the German word Schlier, which means streak, and it was first observed in 16th\n 65 by Robert Hooke, who was using two candles and some lenses. Then in the 19th century they used this method to try to find defects in the glass used to make lenses. And more recently people have used Schlieren to study aerodynamics and fluid flow because it\n allows you to see those pressure differences and temperature gradients so you can look at shock waves and differences in the composition of gases. So when you watch the lighting of this match you're seeing heat generated from friction igniting phosphorus which in turn generates more heat and\n begins the reaction between sulfur and potassium chlorate, which releases sulfur dioxide, which you can also see.\n And you can see my breath as I blow out the flame.\n I am so excited that I got this set up to work. So if you can think of anything that would look really cool in Schlieren, then let me know in the comments and I will try to make it happen. And if you're new to this channel, well, click here to subscribe. I've got some awesome videos coming up very soon.\n soon.\n you"

This is a sketch that scientists make that shows all the forces acting on you.\n on an object. Each force is represented by an arrow. The size of the arrow represents the magnitude of the force and its direction indicates the direction of the force. So for example, right now there is a downward\n gravitational force on me that pulls me towards the center of the earth. There's another force that a lot of people don't think about but it's pretty important and it's the force from the ground pushing me upward. For most people it's kind of\n strange to think that the ground, which is something inanimate, could be putting a force up on me. But let me try to convince you that the earth really is pushing up on me by stepping on this toy here that supports\n As I step onto the spring, it contracts. So you can imagine the spring must be trying to expand out and put a force outwards.\n So that force in effect supports me, pushes up on my feet, and balances the gravitational force down so that I remain motionless. Now the ground is very similar to this spring. The ground is just a very similar\n stiff spring, but every time you step you compress the ground a little bit and that is enough to make the ground create a force on you pushing you back up. The force of the ground upwards must be equal to the gravity\n gravitational force downwards so that you stay at rest. For simplicity, we draw all forces acting through the center of mass of an object. So even though the force is acting on my feet, I can draw that force upwards as acting through my center\n of mass. So there are really only two main forces on you. The force of gravity downwards and something we call the normal force which pushes you back up. The reason we call it the normal force is because the word normal\n means perpendicular. And the force is perpendicular to the surface that you're standing on."

On top is a 1 kilogram aluminium plate. So we hear this noise, what's that noise? It's the vibration of the plate.\n Because it's vibrating at two times the frequency of this one. How does it do that?\n To find out, I've come to the place where it all started. The Royal Institution in London. This is the key to Faraday's magnetic lab. It's amazing that lock still works. From the 1870s on, it became a storeroom, which is why it survived.\n In Faraday's time, it was known that electric current creates a magnetic field, but it remained an open question whether the\n as possible if a magnetic field could generate electric current. Faraday answered this question with his most famous apparatus. Faraday's electromagnetic induction ring, which is this. In August\n August 1831, Faraday wrapped two coils of insulated wire around this iron ring.\n It takes 10 working days, which is a huge investment of time. But the investment paid off. When Faraday connected a battery to one of the coils, he saw a brief pulse of current in the other coil. And when he disconnected the battery, he saw a pulse of current in the other direction.\n He realized that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing. And if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced. And that's due to the interaction of their magnetic fields.\n Which brings us back to this. Through the bottom coil we are passing a huge electric current, 800 amps, which alternates in direction 900 times per second. This ensures there will always be a changing magnetic field above the coil.\n of a second coil we're using the aluminium plate but the principle is the same. The changing magnetic field induces currents in the plate that create an opposing magnetic field so it levitates. How awesome is that?\n This current is not only good for levitating the plate, it can also make light bulbs glow.\n Can I put it there? Yep. And just as current in a toaster element heats it up, the induced current in the plate dissipates its energy as heat. Check out how hot this plate is!\n Tell me this is not the best dinner table centerpiece. It levitates, it gives you light, and you can cook\n on it, and all the while you're demonstrating Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\n Because the flame has those ions in it, it means that we can break down a greater distance of air. Why isn't there a big hole around the tree where it's taken out all the soil? Because as I say, gradually, the soil has time to recover.\n Do you love you?"

            "transcription": "I'm in! I'm floating in shade balls! This feels incredible! Because like, I can hardly tell there's water under me. It feels like there's\n I feel like this is the internet's fault because I made this video about the shade balls on LA Reservoir\n And a lot of people asked, can you swim in shade balls? And I'm like, it's a drinking reservoir. Obviously you can't swim in the drinking water. But then I thought, you know what, we know the people who actually made these shade balls. And so\n I could call them up and order them and sure enough I've purchased 10,000 shade balls to try to swim in. Now, there is a scientific and safe way to test this which would be to go in the shallow end but I'm gonna do the YouTube way which is to jump in the deep end and just\n see if I can swim. It was probably right about now that I thought back to my\n with the shade ball manufacturer. You don't recommend swimming in shade balls? So do you think it's a bit dangerous maybe? It's dangerous. So dangerous in fact that he regularly refuses requests from residential customers. They didn't even want to sell me shade balls. I pretty\n What makes shade balls inherently more dangerous than other plastic balls is that they're half full of\n water so they're heavy. This bag of 1200 shade balls weighs 300 kilograms or 660 pounds. So when I ordered 10,000 of these things I didn't really think about how hard it would be to get them home and now we have them all in the back of a U-Haul. Now the only\n challenge getting them out. After driving the largest vehicle I've ever attempted across LA, I hired a moving company. It's time to release the\n the balls.\n Kind of surprised 6,000 shape balls doesn't quite cover the whole pool, but it's just about there.\n And you can see already the balls have sort of arranged themselves in crystal structures where they're close packed and then there's some boundaries between these grains. We basically got a single layer of balls on the whole pool. I'm going to jump in.\n try to swim with them. We'll see how that works and if I can do that then we have 3,600 more that we can put on top. Which brings us back to...\n you\n Alright I'm swimming. So this is breaststroke and I can swim but I am getting\n A lot of balls in the face. Oh, YouTube. A few observations. For objects whose purpose is to block out sunlight, a surprising amount still gets through. That's because even packed as tightly as possible,\n spheres only cover about 91% of the water surface. Light coming through the cracks and reflecting off the balls makes these really interesting patterns on the bottom of the pool. When swimming through shapes\n balls the other thing that hits you is the noise they make so much noise so close to your head that it's virtually impossible to hear anything else I feel like you're getting an\n extra workout frankly. I'm gonna try a different swim stroke I'm gonna go over to front crawl or freestyle. I feel like I'm\n I feel like I'm getting knocked around like in a rock tumbling. Swimming in shade balls made me reflect on drag.\n the force that opposes motion when moving through a fluid. Drag is typically proportional to your velocity squared. Why is that? Well, let's imagine these shade balls as particles of their own fluid, and the faster you go, the more of them you encounter.\n counter per second, but also the faster they're moving relative to you and hence the impact they have on you as you push them out of the way. So that's why drag is proportional to v squared because you run into more of them and they're moving faster relative to\n so they have a greater impact. Swimming is a good workout. Swimming is shade balls. Next level. Next level. So I'm not actually the best swimmer, so I brought over some friends, Christian and Jordan. Alright, let's try it. Three, two, one.\n Butterfly is even more challenging because not only do you have to push the balls forward, they also get pushed down and up and out.\n Haha!\n How was it? That's insane. It looks hard. You get hit in your face and your shoulders. So with it clear that you can swim, albeit with difficulty, in a single layer of shaved balls, it was time to test if you can swim in more\n multi-layer shade balls.\n This is, in fact, how most of LA Reservoir is covered. It looks as though you could like float on the top, so I'm gonna see if I can like run across these\n It's gonna end poorly I'm sure. Three, two, one.\n Similar attempts to slide across the surface of the shade balls were also doomed to failure. Each ball is almost half full of water.\n So when fully submerged it only supports around 300 grams. That means to support my body entirely above the water I'd need more than 260 shave balls trapped under me. This is amazing!\n But what about the central question can you swim in\n in multiple layers of shade balls.\n I found a kind of unorthodox style, swimming mostly beneath the shade balls.\n the boat said you just don't move I was as hard as I could and I just couldn't like go anywhere but don't just take my word for it watch Jordan try butterfly\n Unlike in the single layer where the balls could easily move past each other\n with multiple layers the balls kind of get trapped against each other and act more like a solid providing significantly more resistance so I wanted to see if I could use this to my advantage. I'm gonna lower myself gently down with the hose\n And see if I can float on top of all these these shade balls. All right, here we go. I'm in! I'm floating!\n in shape all this feels incredible cuz like I can hardly tell there's water under me it feels like just being in a ball pit\n That is exactly like quicksand. Oh my goodness. If you don't move, you're good on the surface. But then if you start moving around, all the balls get enough energy to sort of shift.\n And then you start sinking down deeper and deeper and deeper. Now after all this, the one question I'm left with is what do you do with 10,000 shade balls? Well I've decided that I am going to sign each one and\n mail it out to a Patreon supporter. So if you want to receive one of these balls signed by me, go and sign up to be a Patreon supporter. Now, my plan is to send these out to basically every Patreon supporter I have, everywhere\n in the world, I'll put more details in the description below. Obviously the shipping costs are going to be horrendous, but it is your support on Patreon that allows me to do things like this. So this is my way of saying thank you."

            "transcription": "Hey, you look purple. I guess I should come clean. Can you smile for me? You're eating. My two front teeth are fake. Oh my god. Your two front teeth are purple. And fake teeth look\n look different than real teeth in the ultraviolet.\n At first glance, the world through a UV camera looks like a black and white version of the normal, visible light world. I mean, these white flowers are white in UV. This black towel? Still black in UV. And this makes a lot of sense.\n because ultraviolet light is very similar to visible light. I mean, it's right beside it on the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths are just a little shorter, the energy per photon a little higher. So I would expect, as my first order assumption, that all matter should interact\n roughly the same way with ultraviolet light as it does with visible light. But once you take a closer look you find that the world in UV is so much stranger and more wonderful.\n than you could have imagined. For example, it looks a lot hazier, visibility is reduced, and clouds kind of blend in with the sky. It's like there's this fog everywhere. So why is this? I want you\n to try to work it out before I explain it at the end of this video. Now take a look at these glasses. In the visible part of the spectrum they are transparent, they look like regular lenses, but in the UV they're almost black. They're absorbing so much\n ultraviolet light. Now take a look at this filter. In the visible it looks black, but now in the ultraviolet it looks transparent or at least translucent. This is a UV pass filter. It's absorbing all the visible light\n and allowing the UV to pass through it. These two objects flip my intuitions about the world on their head. Then you come to something like this. In one of these bottles is soda water and in the other is tonic water.\n Can you tell which is which? It's pretty hard to tell just using visible light, but in the ultraviolet, it's obvious. This one looks like cola. So why is that? Well, it's because...\n There are some molecules in here that interact with ultraviolet light differently than ordinary water. To really see what's going on we've got to take\n this inside. Same bottles, ultraviolet lamp. When I turn it on, it's the tonic water that is bright, whereas outside it was dark. How does this make any sense? Well the thing is, tonic water contains the\n which was originally a preventative medicine against malaria, but it tasted so bitter that people mixed it with sugar water and made a tonic. Now some people quite like that tonic. But the thing about the quinine molecule is that it fluoresces.\n meaning that it absorbs ultraviolet light and re-radiates it as visible light. And that's why in here it looks like it's glowing, but outside where we're looking at it in the ultraviolet, it looks dark because it is absorbing that ultraviolet energy.\n And there are some other products that have fluorescent molecules in them, often laundry detergents. So I'm going to try this one out. Does it look any different? Does it basically look the same? One of the ideas with laundry detergent is to make things look\n really bright, really white, by absorbing wavelengths that you can't see, like ultraviolet, and then re-radiating them in the visible part of the spectrum. Which, in fact, makes them look much darker in the ultraviolet, because they are absorbing that energy to re-radiate.\n in the visible. Now if you're trying to find things that look different in ultraviolet light as opposed to visible light, well flowers are a really good place to start because bees and other insects can see ultraviolet light and so plants have a reason to evolve pigments that\n they can see. Looking at these sunflowers you can see on the inner parts of the petals there's actually this really dark pigment in the ultraviolet it's almost black but you can't tell that at all just looking with your eyes. The way these pigments work is that they are\n molecules that have energy transitions which correspond to the energy of an ultraviolet photon. So a UV photon comes in, hits an electron and excites it up to a higher energy level. And then the electron can actually de-excite in these molecules\n by transferring its energy to the molecule, to the bonds in that molecule causing them to bend and vibrate and stretch. So effectively, it's transferring the UV energy into thermal energy and ultimately to heat. Our skin has molecules that\n do the same thing, specifically melanin. And I'm bringing in Diana, the physics girl who has been filming this video with me because she knows a lot about melanin. Oh yeah, because I'm so tan. Right, so your body wants to protect itself against UV rays.\n UV rays and so there's some cells in your skin called melanocytes that produce more melanin when UV rays hit your skin. And that melanin absorbs a lot of visible light so it looks darker in the visible which is why when you have more melanin you look more\n Exactly. Melanin actually absorbs even better in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. That's where its peak is, and so our skin looks darker in the ultraviolet camera than it does in the regular visible camera. Yeah. What I find so amazing is that these melanin\n The melanin molecules are transported inside the cell to the nucleus, forming this protective cap over the place where the DNA is stored. And that way, they prevent ultraviolet light from penetrating into the nucleus and causing damage to the DNA.\n One thing I think was really interesting looking at your face in the UV, Diana. What's that, Eric? How do I put this? I mean, your skin is so clear and beautiful in the visible part of the spectrum. Oh, okay. Yeah, bring it on. So what is surprising is how you can see a lot more contrast.\n Maybe some freckles that I didn't even know were there. It is surprising. No, but it's true. I mean I noticed it on yours as well. Thank you. There's a bit around your eyes. There are spots I can't notice just looking at you in the visible spectrum and then and then\n They pop right out when you're looking through a UV camera. And you know some animals that also absorb UV? I don't. Harp seal pups. So in the Arctic, when they're... That's very specific. It is. But when they're trying to do aerial surveys,\n When you take photographs of colonies of seals, it's pretty easy to spot the adults because they are dark colored. But the pups, I guess being young and defenseless, they have a kind of camouflage. Their fur is white in the visible part of the spectrum.\n and so they kind of blend into the ice and snow. But in the ultraviolet part, they are absorbing a lot of that radiation. I think the ingenious thing about this is it allows us to get an accurate count of harp seals, because we can count the pups too.\n by taking photos in the ultraviolet. So this is actually one of the uses of ultraviolet photography. You can also look for arctic foxes or polar bears using the same technique because they too absorb ultraviolet and that makes so much sense because these ultraviolet rays\n have high enough energy that they can do damage to your DNA and cause cancers and other diseases. So what should you do if you are in an environment with a lot of sun as we are but maybe you are not evolved for this kind of climate? Yeah I\n I would say if you can't find some shade, put on sunscreen. It's kind of like putting melanin over the top of your skin. Yeah. I mean the active ingredients in sunscreen aren't melanin, but they do effectively the same thing. They take ultraviolet light and\n And they convert it into thermal energy, into heat. Right, right. I mean a lot of ingredients in sunscreen. Some actually reflect ultraviolet as well. But a lot of active ingredients in sunscreen absorb ultraviolet light and change it into heat. This is what it looks like.\n if you don't go outside in the sun very much. I just use sunscreen. Is that right? Well, not every day, but I remember my mom was like, use sunscreen. I'm like, OK. So why does the world look so hazy in the ultraviolet?\n My first thought was that it must be something in the atmosphere that is absorbing the ultraviolet light, like pollution or just one of the components of our atmosphere. But as Physics Girl pointed out to me, if things were really absorbing ultraviolet light, well, the sky would look darker.\n not light, not foggy like it does. And of course if you do look at the absorption specter of the common atmospheric molecules you'll find that virtually nothing absorbs in the UV. So what is going on? Well the answer is\n scattering. The same phenomenon that makes our sky blue is responsible for the reduced visibility, this foggy hazy appearance in the UV. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more likely it is to bounce off tiny molecules in our atmosphere.\n and scatter in all directions. So when we look up, we are actually seeing a blue haze blocking out space. It's a really cool way of thinking about the blue sky. Rally scattering is inversely proportional to\n to the wavelength of light to the power of 4. So it really strongly increases the shorter the wavelength becomes. In fact, there's about 5 times as much scattering of ultraviolet light than there is a visible light in the middle of the spectrum. So you know\n So if we could see ultraviolet light, we might look up and ask, not why is the sky blue, but why is the sky ultraviolet? And this is, I think, the amazing thing about seeing in the ultraviolet.\n It's that it shows us how the world is not how we perceive it to be. There's so much more going on there than we would ever imagine. Oh my gosh. Oh, that's very interesting. Now I want more of this.\n You know it's one thing to know the way the world works, but it's another to see it.\n So you're doing a video on different SPFs and all the sunscreen controversies on your channel. Yes! I'm talking about whether SPFs of sunscreen look different with a UV camera, why SPF labeling is so weird, and why the\n FDA has proposed rules years ago, we still haven't figured out how to label sunscreens. It is controversial. Yeah. Awesome. So I'll put a link to Diana's video, you should go check it out. Also, the How to Make Everything guys have made sunscreen.\n They've made sunscreen! I haven't seen it yet, but I will put a link to their video so you can go check that out as well. Why is this fly only attacking me? Because I'm wearing sunscreen. It likes the smell of you. Yeah."

            "transcription": "It's another beautiful day in Sydney. I'm out enjoying the sun and looking to find out if anyone knows why the sun shines. So the sun gives us a lot of... Hate? Sunshine? Provides energy.\n Where does the sun get that energy from? I have no idea. I have no idea. Some kind of chemical reaction? Yeah, gas explosions.\n But is the sun really a giant ball of fire?\n I mean, wouldn't it go out after five billion years? It's one of those things that you just assume you know but then you don't actually know. So in this bucket I have the components of the Sun. Well, I have protons and neutrons. There's some\n electrons but I didn't bring them. Most of the sun is actually protons. And so what are the protons doing to the sun? It dances together.\n When they come close, you know what they do? They just... Well actually they bounce off each other. I'm coming in... Why do the protons bounce off each other? Something to do with electrons? Positive, negative, electrons. Because they don't like each other.\n They don't like each other. That's because a proton needs a neutron, right? Do you know why they repel like that? Magnetic force. The repelling magnet type thing. Magnet field. Electric force.\n This is why it's so important that the sun's hot, because if the sun is hot enough, it gets these things moving so fast.\n fast that sometimes they can't avoid a collision. And when they get too close they actually go... An explosion.\n And now they're stuck together and you saw what happened when they smashed together\n What happened? They leaked. Is that energy? Yeah. Sick. Well the water poured out but I guess energy would have poured out. The energy came out. The energy came out. What was the energy before it was energy?\n Kinetic energy? Sword energy. So what's happening there? It's releasing some mass by colliding. And that mass is... Is converted into energy. It was the mass of the protons!\n When the protons smashed together they got lighter and they lost that mass and the mass was converted to energy. You know a famous equation about that? A equals mc squared. A equals mc squared. We get mc2. Have you heard that famous equation?\n Which? The person who makes energy? Well... A equals MC squared, yes. So what's E? The sun? I don't know. E is energy, that means mass.\n C is... Cassidy. Carbon? I don't remember what C means. So C is... The speed of light. The speed of light? No. Right? Really? Yeah! Isn't that weird? The speed of light.\n Right. Right. Ah. Wow. Now why do we drop signs? It seems most people have a tough time remembering that c is for the speed of light. Maybe that's because c is a bit of a strange letter to represent a speed. In fact, in Einstein's original paper, he used the\n What is that equation telling us about the speed of light?\n energy and mass. Energy equals constant mass. The mass and the energy combined together creates the energy. It's basically\n saying like this mass that comes out gets converted to a lot of energy and the speed of light is a huge number yeah you think about that tiny bit of mass is a huge amount of energy so every second the Sun is actually losing 4.3 billion\n kilograms every second that amount of mass is being converted into energy in the Sun hydrogen fuses together to form helium but that's a little confusing because how out of only protons do we create\n a helium nucleus which has two protons and two neutrons. Well the thing is, when the first two smash together, one of the protons actually emits a positron and a neutrino and quickly becomes a neutron.\n Next thing that happens is another proton smashes in and again we get more energy released. Now if two particles like this collide they emit two protons and what we're left with is\n the helium-4 nucleus. There you have hydrogen fused into helium. And a lot of mass lost, a lot of energy released. If you want to know more about\n in the Sun, check out this video by MinutePhysics. It explains how the protons can fuse even though they're not really going fast enough to overcome their repulsion.\n time."

And that's a bit strange because they were both hit by the same type of bullet.\n bullet from the same rifle so presumably it had the same kinetic energy and they both go the same height so they both have the same gravitational potential energy but one is rotating and so it has that additional rotational energy so one block has more\n more energy than the other block.\n They went up to the same height which is incredibly confusing to me. Why is that confusing? Because that doesn't- where's that extra energy coming from?\n But the fact is that one block clearly does have more energy. You think about them both at the top.

            "transcription": "Now I'd like you to make a prediction. In my left hand I have a basketball. In my right hand a 5 kilogram medicine ball. If I hold them both above my head and then let them go simultaneously, which one will hit the ground first?\n Six years ago here at the University of Sydney I did an experiment very similar to this where I handed out a heavy object and a light object and I asked which one would hit the ground first. Tell me which one's gonna hit the ground first. I'm gonna put my money on the blackboard.\n What's your heart telling you? I reckon it's gonna drop faster. I'm on the black one as well. Yeah, I'll go with you. This one go faster and hit the ground first. You're gonna pick that one? What's your feeling about that one? How does it compare to the... Well, it's a lot heavier and I just feel like the weight is, you know, pulling\n The more weight it's, the faster it's going to fall to the ground. The forces are more on that ball than this one. You can definitely tell the difference. I mean, I go to the gym like seven days a week, but I still feel it. I can still feel it. Well, that one feels like it could almost go up, where this one?\n It's got air in it, so it's lifting up as opposed to this one being pulled down. Now I think, now you're coming back to me, I'm thinking basketball now. What's making you think basketball? Because you're coming back to me. I'm just saying, like...\n You can't corrupt me. I'm going to stay solo on the block. Alright, let's actually do this thing. So do you want to hook us up? As high as you can. And the key is to be as simultaneous as you can. Alright, are you ready? You want to count it down? Yep. 3, 2, 1.\n Three, two, one. Yes! We did it! What did you think happened? I thought the black one went first. You thought the black one landed first.\n We'd have to go to the tape. What did you see?\n They look like they pretty much landed at the same time. They hit the ground at the same time? I thought it was very close, probably just a bee's dick in it. It's not a very high distance, so they haven't really reached their maximum velocity yet. The blackboard just didn't reach terminal velocity, wasn't enough time.\n The answer is, although the force of gravity on the black ball\n is greater, it has a greater mass and therefore greater inertia, so it requires more force to accelerate it. There's less gravitational force on the basketball, but because its mass is lower, it has less inertia and therefore\n requires less force to accelerate it at the same rate as the medicine ball. Let's give it a try. Three, two, one.\n you"

            "transcription": "In 2014, the qualifying exam for the US physics team had this as question 19. A helicopter is flying horizontally at constant speed. A perfectly flexible uniform cable is suspended beneath the helicopter. Air friction\n on the cable is not negligible. So which of the following diagrams best shows the shape of the cable as the helicopter flies through the air to the right? Is it A. Hanging straight down? B. Hanging diagonally to the left? C.\n Now apparently there's been a certain amount of controversy about the correct answer to this question, so today we're going to go up in this helicopter and\n this question to rest once and for all. Let's go! A portion of this video was sponsored by SimpliSafe, which allowed us to rent this helicopter. More about them at the end.\n end of the show.\n the rope is going to interact with the rotor wash as it's interacting with the ambient air around the aircraft and we'll get a whipping action that falls down the rope and flips around on the end to a point that we worry if it will have a tendency to work\n its way back up towards the aircraft. Obviously we don't want it getting in the rotors or the gel rotor. All right, we're all set.\n Here I'm deploying a battle rope like you'd see at the gym. This one is about 15 meters long and it weighs 20 kilograms.\n Now the setup looks pretty simple.\n But few people agree on what the right answer should be. When I polled YouTube, the most common answer was C. Well done on making that beautiful bell curve, by the way.\n in touch with the questions author, Professor Paul Stanley.\n blowing downwards so that they could mimic the motion of the helicopter and suspended a string and said, oh, it's this design. And the faculty members looked at it and said, oh, obviously I can prove that the answer is this answer.\n They just didn't agree with each other. What do you think? I think you're more likely to be C. I think it is D. My guess is B. What do you think? B?\n Interestingly, no one chose E. Have you locked in your prediction? To make sure the rope doesn't come up into the rotors of the helicopter, pilot Craig\n wanted to keep the rope on our right side so he could keep an eye on it. So we're not going straight forward, we're actually\n going diagonally forward and to the left. But you can clearly see the rope is hanging straight diagonally to the left.\n So the correct answer to the question is B. We're going to try a few more experiments adding a weight to\n end of the rope and then a parachute, but first I want to discuss why the answer is B. There are two external forces acting on the rope, gravity pulling it down and air resistance to the left. When flying along at constant\n speed, these forces must be perfectly balanced by the tension in the rope. Now, when I set out to do this experiment, I wondered if the rope would be affected by the air pushed down by the helicopter's rotor. But judging by our results, this was not the case.\n So you can consider the air resistance on the rope as entirely due to its motion through still air.\n Imagine dividing the rope up into many short sections. Each section has the same weight and experiences the same amount of air resistance because it has the same cross-sectional area and it's moving at the same speed. Now the tension in any section of the rope\n rope must balance the sum of the air resistance and weight of all the sections beneath it. So the tension is zero at the bottom of the rope and it increases linearly up to a maximum at the top. You can see the tension\n small at the bottom of the rope, that's why it wiggles around while the top is much steadier. Now although the magnitude of tension changes throughout the rope, its direction doesn't. And that's because the ratio of air resistance to weight is the same, and\n at every point along the rope. That is why a uniform flexible cable hangs in a straight diagonal line when pulled at constant speed by a helicopter. If the helicopter flies faster, the angle of the rope changes.\n But it still makes a diagonal straight line because the ratio of air resistance to weight is still constant along the entire length of the rope. But this got me wondering, what would happen if we added a weight to the\n end of the rope. Here I have a 20 pound that's an 8 or 9 kilo kettlebell and I want to ask you to make a prediction. What shape do you think the rope will make now? Will it still be that diagonal or will it be one of the other five\n options. One more question for you if we checked a weight at the bottom which shape would it be? Probably B. B or possibly C? Does that change it? Then I think it would be B.\n Easy to do on the ground. Alright, we're dropping the rope over the side. One has a 20 pound kettlebell off the end of it.\n How's that feel when it's dangling? No lateral displace at all. Alright. How's your forearms doing? I'm feeling good, you know, I feel like this is the easy way obviously. It's gonna feel different\n Okay, let's give it a shot. Here the helicopter is flying at nearly 100 kilometers per hour. And the rope makes\n a different shape. You can clearly see it looks like an inverted J. This is option D. In fact, this is how the question on the qualifying exam originated.\n So I taught for a semester in Hong Kong and would go hiking in the new territories. One of the times I was hiking, I saw a helicopter fly with a cable beneath it. It was carrying something to one of the remote parts of the\n Hong Kong New Territories, and I saw the shape of the cable and thought to myself, that looks a little counterintuitive and very neat. This might make a good multiple choice question for the selection exam for the students. The cable that I saw\n had a weight hanging on the end, which gave it a certain curved shape. When I shared this with the other coaches, another coach, Andrew Lin, looked at it and said, I think the question might even be more fun if there is no weight on\n the cable because that is even harder to imagine. To understand why the rope makes this shape, we can use the same analysis as before, but now we need to add a large weight to the end of the rope. This means at the\n bottom the tension needs to be almost vertical to support the weight of the kettlebell, which has a lot of weight but not much air resistance. As you go up the rope, the ratio of total air resistance to weight for everything beneath\n increases, so the rope turns more horizontal in order for the tension to balance out that increasing air resistance.\n For the final test, I wanted to add something to the bottom of the rope that added almost no weight, but significant air resistance. So I picked a Veritasium flag, of course. So what do you think about hanging this at the end of the rope? Well, you know, it's all science experiment for me.\n because these are all the things you never do with a helicopter and a rope. What would be the real risk? Like tail rotor or this rotor or both? Either. Any kind of this. Either tail rotor would be a destruction of the aircraft.\n I'm going to go to the beach.\n Now the rope still seems to be pretty straight. I think it's because the\n flag isn't actually adding much drag. So we decided to add a small parachute to the end of the rope. Alright let's try it. The concern here was that the parachute\n could get flipped up into the rotors during deployment, so we bundled the shoot up into a backpack.\n Now with the parachute at the end of the rope it makes a J shape which is answer C. With extra air resistance at the end of the rope but not much weight\n the tension has to be virtually horizontal. And then as you go up the rope, the ratio of total air resistance to weight for everything beneath decreases, so the rope becomes more vertical to balance out the increasing weight.\n So, depending on what's on the end of the rope, you could get answers B, C, or D. Now, if you enjoyed this video, I bet you would also like my bullet block experiment series, so check it out.\n Now hanging out the side of a helicopter was not my safest moment, but I do always feel safe here at home thanks to SimpliSafe, the sponsor of this portion of the video.

            "transcription": "Now at some point growing up most of us have been captivated by one of these a slinky But recently I found out one of the most\n Mesmerizing things about how it moves is something I'd never seen before how it falls So what's so surprising about a falling slinky? Well to help explain is\n The idea is that I hold the top end of the slinky like this and then let the bottom end dangle. So the slinky is dangling freely. And then I'm going to drop the slinky. But I want you to predict what's going to happen. Will the top end fall first?\n Will the bottom end fall first? Will both ends fall together? Or will the two ends approach each other in the middle? That is a tough question. When I let go, what does the bottom do?\n Shoot off? It's gonna fall. It's actually gonna fall. Bottom goes up, top goes down. It might come up together. You're going to see the top come down to the middle and the bottom come up to the top. Come to me and then drop. The top will accelerate.\n faster than the bottom. I reckon that bottom will stay there, this will come down to there and then I'll go for it. Alright, well why don't we give it a shot here. I want you to watch the whole slinky as it falls to see what it's doing. Count it down.\n Two one the problem is it's a bit hard to tell with the naked eye just what's happening. No idea thing came up bottom come up. I couldn't be sure to buy\n To really appreciate the physics involved, you need to see it in slow motion. Oh!\n Gosh, that's great. That's weird. That's unbelievable. It does stay there. Just stays there, like in midair. It's suspended. What? Yeah, it doesn't move at all.\n How does that work? How does that work? How do you explain that? Well, you've got to look at what's happening at the bottom end. Gravity's pulling the bottom end down. Tension's pulling the bottom end up. The two forces are equal and opposite.\n opposite, so the bottom end remains at rest. Then I let go at the top end, the tension in the spring changes, but it propagates down the spring, coil by coil, until it reaches the bottom end, and that takes about a quarter of a second.\n and the bottom end falls. So the tension doesn't actually change at the bottom end until the rest of the slinky has collapsed? Correct. The same principle applies to sporting equipment like tennis rackets or golf gloves. When contact is made with a ball, a wave\n travels up the shaft so the golfer's hands don't feel the hit until after the ball is already on its way to the hole. Now as a final extension on this experiment we've tied a tennis ball to the base of the slinky. We're gonna drop it and see what happens this time.\n Incredibly, the same thing happens. That's because the slinky has simply stretched further and reached a new equilibrium where the gravitational force down equals the tension force up. It didn't make a difference. It is counterintuitive, but\n That's what makes physics so interesting. That's why I keep doing experiments like this.\n you"

            "transcription": "In this US government lab, they study airflow to solve crimes. Using mirrors, lights, and lasers, they can illuminate the tiniest differences in air temperature and density, and track how drug powder settles in the rooms of\n the house, determine which person fired a gun, or spot particles escaping from a sealed package. A portion of this video was sponsored by Caseta by Lutron. Our best tool for picking up trace substances has been the same for\n centuries.\n We tried to get one of the police canines to come in here and get in front of the mirror, but dogs get hungry and cranky very quickly and we got about four seconds of good footage and I'm like, okay, we can do better than this. And dogs can sniff very faint scents and from far away, but they don't do it just\n by breathing in, what they do is breathe out and in rapidly, around five times\n And what allows them to detect scents from far away is the rapid and turbulent exhale.\n that comes out of each nostril. Just like when you and I exhale. If you put your hand under here and just exhale out of your nose, those are two turbulent air jets coming out of the dog's nose. But when the dog is down on the ground, those air jets are vectored back towards its rear. The dog is pushing air\n back and by doing that it's pulling air from ahead of it. So imagine me blowing air this way and when I do that I actually reach out and pull air towards me. The dog reverses flow, inhales, right, gets a new sample\n analyzes it with an amazing chemical detector upstairs, right? It's olfactory region and does it at five times a second. On average, a dog when it's sniffing for something five times a second repetitive sine wave. So that's what makes the dog this\n incredible sampling system. It kind of didn't matter the breed of dog. So somehow their evolution allowed them to figure out, okay, one over five seconds is what I need before I take the next puff, the next inhale. If the dog had a\n infinite lung capacity and it just inhaled constantly, it has a very limited reach. But because of this in and out bellows effect, its reach goes up by roughly a factor of 18. We actually, we have a number of commercially available vapor detectors, okay?\n Some of these are really good for various explosives and drugs. Some are very good for chemical and biological hazards. But they all just inhale air. What we did is we designed and printed what are essentially nostrils that plug onto this thing and make it sniff like a dog.\n dog. And then by doing a set of controlled experiments by moving your vapor source farther and farther, we were able to on average improve the detection capabilities of these by roughly a factor of 16 to 18. Just by making them sniff like a real dog.\n We're able to see this dog breath using Schlieren imaging.\n light diverges and it comes up and it fills our mirror. Think of these light beams as arrows, okay, and they're a bunch of arrows that are coming up, they're straight as can be, but when they pass something of a different refractive index, which could be the\n heat from my hand or different density, which could be a gas of a different density. Those light rays, they shift a little bit. They shift very slightly. They refract, they bend. Then they all come back.\n So we're coming back here and right here we have a two-way mirror. So light can travel through the mirror this way, but when it comes back it turns 90 degrees. And if you look right here I have a razor blade. And what this is doing, it is positioning\n exactly at the focal point of that mirror. I have that razor blade edge, it's able to move in and out of the focal plane. And so what I do is I cut off those arrows of light, those beams of light that shifted a little bit.\n and I cut them off, I block them. As I move the knife edge out so I'm not cutting off any light right now, so you basically have a really expensive mirror, it's not doing anything for you. But as I take this razor blade and push it in, you\n You start to see, you know, turbulence in the air. And as I take it more and more, yeah, there you go, get your hand in there. Whoa. Your Schlierensadap is so much better than mine. So take a look at this. So this is in a shower.\n So why does this work?\n work?\n casting a shadow of that plume on the wall, which is why it's called a shadow graph. These can still be used to visualize flow patterns in detail. Just by looking at the footage of guns fired in a shadow graph, we can actually figure out the speed\n the bullet and how loud the bang was.\n 1.05 maybe just above sonic compare that to the infamous AK 47 assault rifle there's there's two things that we can qualitative qualitatively observe here one is if you compare these side to side the Smith and Wesson versus the AK\n The hot gases released when the gun is fired expand\n and\n by how dark that shock appears. Any object moving through air creates pressure\n waves that travel out at the speed of sound. Since this bullet is moving faster than the speed of sound, the pressure waves it creates all get compressed together into a single conical shockwave. It's like a tiny sonic boom.\n And you can use this to determine the speed of the bullet. The sine of the angle is the ratio of the speed of sound to the speed of the object. There is a different way to visualize flow, which is with a laser sheet.\n It illuminates fine particles, so we can see the plumes of gunpowder residue created when the gun is fired.\n camera. Yeah. So what's happening here is we have a laser beam and we send it, we steer it through a cylindrical glass rod. All it is is a piece of glass that's a cylinder. And what that does is it spreads that beam\n into a two-dimensional wall of laser light. Okay, and so the way this works is whenever particles or theatrical fog cross through this sheet, they light up because of the laser. There's a lot of\n effort now going into understanding gunshot residue. So gunshot residue is the kind of burned and unburned propellant that occurs whenever a firearm is discharged, right? So what we're looking at here is using laser lights and high-speed\n cameras is we're looking at the plume of gunshot residue that's generated after a firing event. This is looking at ventilation inside an actual gun range. But look at all this. This is all gunshot residue that you can't see with the naked eye, but is\n there. So you can imagine if you're inside a home, this is five shots in a few seconds, enormous amounts of material. A lot of this is landing on the hands of the shooter. But unfortunately, a lot of it is also being dispersed into the local environment. It goes\n goes way farther than I expected.\n actively trying to pursue right now. So these are tools and techniques that we use here at NIST that are qualitative or sometimes semi-quantitative, but they really help illustrate what's happening. And then the public security\n part of this deals with trace contraband detection. We're all generating heat, right? So we all have this warm plume of air. You want to see it? I'll show you. It's kind of crazy. So you seeing it there? So that is called the human thermal\n plume and guess what's in that plume? Water? Parts of me. Skin cells. No way. Yeah. So we're shedding skin cells at a pretty creepy rate. I forget what the number is but it's a lot. Thousands an hour.\n What do you mean?\n It's all based on this fundamental principle. It's called low cards exchange principle. It's in forensic science. It's that every contact leaves a trace. And what that means is when you're done in this lab, there will be parts of you left behind in this lab. Whether you like it or not,\n it or not, right? Because we're all shedding skin cells and taking things, taking stuff with us. So if I'm a bomb maker, if I'm involved in manufacturing, you know, illegal fentanyl in my basement, I am ultimately contaminating myself with the\n material and this contamination comes in the form of very very small particles and the chemical detection systems that we have available now are so sensitive they can detect a single particle of say an explosive\n residue. Imagine you have a bomb in a package, right, and you're at some kind of screening facility, right, you're at a facility that maybe is screening things coming in from overseas, maybe you've got a sniffer.\n you've got a commercially available vapor detector. And you've got 10 seconds to sample this package. Where do you point your device? Right? These are the kinds of experiments that help us understand where you should point your device. We call this burping.\n burping the package. So we have some acetone in here so wherever you burp it, where you squeeze it, you have acetone vapor coming out of all the gaps. Right? So they're coming out in the gaps. So that gap gives you the highest chance of acetone\n actually detecting what's inside. You don't want to go over here where there's no gaps, you don't want to go up there where there's no gap, you want to go in these corners here where stuff is actually kind of permeating through and outside of the box. This is some recent work we're doing. We are\n basically simulating illicit drug manufacturing. So here's some talc powder, right? The big deal, I'm gonna shake it up a little bit. When I open this and squeeze, I can't see anything, but are you seeing anything in the camera?\n So again, to the naked eye we'd never be able to see this, but because the laser is doing the illuminating for us, we're able to see this. Let's do a little experiment with this.\n where I am taking a legal substance A and pouring it into substance B. First thing I'll do, just watch when I take the lid off of this.\n Take it from here. There's a little bit coming off. Oh yeah, it's still going. So just imagine.\n you're in a basement and you're building stuff like this and you don't realize that there's all this contamination spreading and landing on other surfaces in your room. And I can't talk about the numbers but they're pretty startling. Like there's a lot. There's a lot.\n Spreads everywhere. It was a lot. Yeah. This thing's gonna be full of smoke in here. You ready? Yep.\n What I really love about the laser sheet technique is it allows you to visualize the turbulence that's in the air. So this is a way we can see how the airflow in the room is actually being tracked. Oh, that's nice. Yep.\n If you look at the graph in the top right, that is actually real-time counts of the particles that are being generated.\n around this person. So this that plot represents basically inhalation exposure of the materials that he's working with. That's crazy if you think about it because that's if that's fentanyl and that person doesn't have a mask on they're gone. We add fluorescent\n powder to this kind of stuff so we can actually visualize where the contamination goes. The other cool part of this is that we can use a quantitative method of sampling surfaces in the house. We basically use swabbing. It's the same idea when you go to the airport.\n You ever gone there and they ask for your hands? And they take a little swab and they wipe your hands? What they're doing is they're looking for these trace amounts of explosive particles that could be on you if you were involved in the manufacture of an explosive device. But that's a drone.\n That's looking at a drone and the question is, because you know you get this cool prop wash and these four propellers that are all interacting with each other. So the question is, can we use the fluid dynamics of a drone to do the sampling for us? Here's what I mean by that.\n a suspected manufacturing facility of something, say it's a methamphetamine or fentanyl, it's very, very expensive to get hazmat crews involved, have them come, they have to gown up, they have to go in to a potential really dangerous\n situation. What if we had a drone? We just flew the drone in, right? It buzzes around and it's got some special kind of collector on the belly of the drone and we're using the prop wash of the drone to stir up particle\n was off of the surface and then somehow inhale them, collect them. The drone comes back to base, you run your chemical analysis, you say, okay the house is clean or no, we found stuff, okay now it's time to pull out the hazmat crew, you know. So the big picture idea that I want you to keep in the back of your head, the\n whole time is this idea of public safety and security. So that's really what happens in this lab. But underneath that kind of umbrella term, think mask research. So when the COVID pandemic hit, we kind of switched gears and\n here to try to address some of the issues related to masks. This thing will actually breathe as a human does. That human happens to be me. So I measured my own kind of breathing rate and then built a system, kind of engineered a pneumatic system that replicates\n It's a fog generator. It looks like there's nothing coming through.\n to make it through. Some do because it's not 100%. So I wrote an image processing code. So you take this information, you plug it into a code, and it analyzes based on pixels and it's counting white pixels. And sure enough, if you use an N95\n You put an N95 on here, you run it through an image processing code. Guess what percentage of pixels light up white? 5%? 5%. I just want you to breathe naturally.\n So when you're inhaling it gets dark and when you're exhaling it gets lighter because the air is being warmed by your lungs and then coming back out. Like it's interesting how fast you can see the effect of the breathing in like\n It just makes it go dark so quickly. That shows me that this doesn't change color at all. This is being used to seal versus filter. I notice that color change is a lot more dramatic.\n you know it was it was in and out. I feel like it's a that's a thinner mask right? Yeah so the heat transfer through it is gonna be greater. I feel like there's a lot coming out over there. Yeah there's a lot if you just breathe naturally\n you'll see a lot coming out there. The thing with masks, right, is like initially they were like masks don't work, don't wear a mask and then they were like masks\n do work and wear a cloth mask and then they're like no no cloth masks don't work. There was a lot of confusion around masks. What we learned early on was that the communication of mask effectiveness could\n have been improved, right? And so that's kind of why I did what we did with the Schlieren. The truth is the average American is not going to sit down and read a scientific journal article, but they will sit down and watch a 90-second video of me coughing\n thing with a mask on and off. And that's what we did. It's kind of a unique relationship we have with other federal agencies here. So you have a three-letter agency that has a specific need for something, right? And the security\n arena. What they'll often do is they'll come here to NIST and they'll say, hey, we're really interested in sampling people's shoes for explosives for whatever reason, right? So what we do here and in this lab in particular is we figure out what are some good ways to sample shoes for explosives.\n What are some not so good ways, right? What do the measurements need to look like to evaluate a shoe sampling system? It doesn't even exist yet. And then what do the standards need to look like that support those measurements?\n And so we figure all this stuff out in the lab, package it up nice and neat, give it back to the sponsoring agency, and then they take it to industry. And industry already has a leg up on the development of these kinds of systems because we did a lot of work on it.\n lot of the heavy lifting here in the lab because with the success of you know doing the COVID related visualization we're realizing now that the application space for this kind of technology is huge. Indoor air quality,\n You can imagine a bigger mirror where we could look at two people interacting with each other and what that transfer looks like from one person to the other. The take-home message is flow visualization is a critical tool that we use here at NIST to really help understand\n Thanks to Lutron for sponsoring this portion of the show.\n Perfect lighting isn't just important for visualizing airflow, it's also essential for making your house feel welcoming, cozy, and safe. With the sponsor of this video, Caseta by Lutron, you can easily set up your own perfect lighting.\n You know, Caseta provides premium smart lighting control including switches, remotes, and plug-in smart dimmers, which allow you to customize your home lighting from anywhere in the house. What I love about smart switches is that one switch can control many regular bulbs, so you can\n effectively make all your bulbs smart just by replacing the switch. And installation is easy. First, make sure you turn off power to the switch, and then disconnect the existing wires and connect them to Caseta's smart switch. If you need any help, they're just a click or\n or a call away. Then with the Smart Hub, you can turn your lights on and off just using your phone, or you can use another device like Alexa or Google Assistant. Caseta works with more smart home brands than any other smart lighting control system.\n Plus, their switches don't rely on wifi, so they always stay connected and you always have control over your lights. I personally like setting timers in my house, for example the lights in my office turn on by themselves in the evening, and this gives me peace of mind that my family will always come\n home to a well-lit house. And the best part of it all is if I'm already in bed, I can just check which lights are still on and turn them off without having to run around the house.

Three, two, one.\n Wow, did you see that? The one connected to the chain landed just before the other free weight. I'd like to show this in slow motion so you can see that the weights are accelerating at just slightly different rates.\n Go!\n The first of the three major works of the same name, the first of the three major works of the same name, was the first of the three major works of the same name, the first of the three major works of the same name, the second of the three major works of the same name, the third of the three major works of the same name, the fourth of the three major works of the same name, the fifth of the three major works of the same name, the sixth of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name, the seventh of the three major works of the same name\n Why did that happen? I mean, most people, most students of physics would know that all objects on Earth's surface should accelerate down at the same rate, 9.8 meters per second squared. But in this case,\n what happens is the chain actually whips the weight around so it accelerates at a rate greater than the acceleration of objects when in freefall. That's a pretty remarkable result. I want you to think about the bend in the chain. As the weight descends, the chain\n The chain goes from falling to becoming stationary, so it's accelerating up. The tension required to accelerate the chain up actually pulls down on the weight, accelerating it at a rate greater than the acceleration due to gravity. And that's why it hits ground first.\n Now this actually happens to bungee jumpers. If the weight of the rope is appreciable, they will actually accelerate down at a rate faster than freefall, faster than 9.8 meters per second squared. When I went bungee jumping I was aware of this. What is actually true is that as\n As you fall, your acceleration will be greater than free fall. That's due to some effects of the way the rope pulls on you. So I'll do an explanation of that later when I'm not scared out of my mind.\n I couldn't figure out what the acceleration was as I was going down but you know it fell high, it fell very fast.\n Very great increase in your rate of speed. Oh my god, that was fast. Loved it."

            "transcription": "So I wanted to talk to people about the different states of matter. Solid, liquid and gas, using water as an example. But I thought first I'd better be sure that we're all on the same page about what water is made of. What's water made of? Water?\n What makes water? Water. Okay, what elements does it take to make water? H2O. So what does that mean? It is water. What elements?\n Water and cold. Water plus cold. But what does the H and the O mean? Something in oxygen. Something in oxygen. Hydrogen. There you go. Hydrogen and oxygen. What's the two mean? Hydrogen-oxygen.\n the two H2O why do we say tooth? I don't know. It's two polypores of hydrogen and one of oxygen. There you go so that that makes what we call a water\n Two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen makes a water... Molecule. I know the word was like on the tip of your tongue. I guess we got there in the end.\n So what's the difference between solid and liquid water? So obviously the temperature of it. It's a lot colder. Ice is frozen. What does it mean to be frozen then? Cold. Cold. Liquid water is no good for skating on.\n So everyone recognizes that temperature is important in determining whether the water is ice or liquid. But what's actually happening between the water molecules?\n frozen what does it mean for something to be frozen it's solid what does it mean for something to be solid that it's like a brick it's like a brick and what makes it like a brick what's happening in there what makes\n it a solid versus a liquid? Well in this case lots of pipes going underneath. That makes it very cold. Makes it very very cold yeah. But what's actually happening to the little bits of water? They're attaching to each other. This is all that we guess work here. I imagine they're attaching to each\n other, they're forming a more solid end to piece. You cool liquid water down and then at some point what happens to it? It slows down, freezes and stops moving. The molecules become frozen. How do they become frozen?\n coagulate is not the technical term for it but everyone was on the right track in ice the water molecules are basically\n fixed in place they form a crystal lattice where their only motion is vibrating so what happens if we heat up the ice like how what happens when like a solid melts they all bounce out and what are we talking\n about what it what is they what are they doing oh like in science you draw little circles what are those little circles oxygen are they just oxygen hydrogen oxygen and the two and the two the temperature is\n higher. So the particles, they're less stable. Less stable? Less stable. Less free to move around. That sounds right. They become separate and they are allowed to move around and in gas maybe they're further apart. Is that what\n So in liquid water, the water molecules not only vibrate, they can also rotate and slide past each other. This is what allows the substance to flow. At even higher temperatures,\n the water molecules become free of that liquid and turn into water vapor. In that state they are very very far apart and moving very quickly. So the major differences between solid, liquid and gas are the motion of the particles and the distance\n between them. Of course, you may want to meditate on these differences some more.\n So you de-excite the mind, you get more orderliness. As you de-excite water vapour, you get water. As you de-excite water, you get ice. More orderly. So in fact, the molecular structure becomes more orderly. That's the difference.\n reasonable how do you de-excite something? Well in this case you actually remove energy from it. In human beings you calm their minds down with meditation. And that works? It does. We get the excited. Does that mean if I meditate too much I might turn into ice though?\n Maybe you'll generally become cool. Good answer, sir. Thank you so much."

            "published_at": "2019-02-18T20:00:11Z",
            "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCrtk-pyP0I",
            "transcription": "Almost eight years ago when this channel was fresh and before I had gray hairs in my beard in fact before I had a beard I made a video showing that if you take a grape and cut it almost completely in half and put it in the microwave you can make some\n plasma. But the explanation we had in that video was lacking. This was me and my friend Dr. Steven Bozey, a fellow physicist. So you should look forward to that on another episode\n episode of Veritasium.\n They studied this effect with high-speed cameras, thermal cameras, electromagnetic modeling, and they came up with an explanation that I think is pretty satisfying and it extends way beyond just microwave grape plasma. So naturally I called up these scientists.\n The scientist showed you don't even need to use a grape. You can get the same effect\n with hydrogel water beads. These are those tiny polymer beads which when you soak in water they increase in volume like a hundred times. To understand\n So to understand how microwaving a grape gives you plasma, we first need to know a few things. Like a typical household microwave uses a frequency of electromagnetic radiation at about 2.45 GHz. That means that the wavelength of\n of microwaves inside the oven is about 12 centimeters long. Now, if you've ever studied electromagnetic radiation, you might have the intuition that interesting things start to happen when the object or obstacle is around the same size\n as the wavelength, which a grape certainly is not. It's not 12 centimeters. But the important quantity is how big is the wavelength inside the object, inside the grape. 12 centimeters in air, but the\n index of refraction of grape material must be close to like 1.33 or something, right? At visible wavelengths it is a lot lower, but in the make-way regime the index of refraction is almost 10. So you have a much higher index of refraction.\n So microwaves are traveling, you know, like ten times slower through the grape than they are through air. Yes. And that means that the wavelength is a tenth its size through air. So instead of 12 centimeters, it's about 1.2 centimeters.\n right about the size of a grape. Now if you take a single grape and place it inside the microwave, don't cut it in half, what you find is that the microwaves actually become trapped inside the grape and that's because of its high refractive index\n and its size.\n kind of it bounces in the borders of the ball and it can't get out. Is it like total internal reflection? Yes, pretty much. Wow, that's interesting. I hadn't thought of it that way. So the microwaves become trapped inside the grape\n And they actually form these resonant modes, you can think of them as standing waves, just ways in which the electromagnetic fields like to oscillate inside a grape, such that the maximum electromagnetic field is actually in the center of the grape.\n in the microwave you see that it heats up not from the outside in as you would expect if it were just absorbing the microwaves but rather from the inside out. If you add a second grape to the microwave you see that the same thing happens the microwaves get trapped in the second grape too and the ampere\n is highest in the very center of the grape and so the heating occurs most of all there. But if you move these two grapes close together, so they're closer than say a wavelength, well then you can start to get interactions between the electromagnetic field\n in the one grape and in the other and in fact if you get the grapes touching then the greatest electromagnetic field actually occurs at that contact point between the two grapes and so that is where you're going to get the greatest oscillating\n electromagnetic fields and that is where those grapes are going to get hottest. It's also interesting that you don't need to cut the grapes in half. Two grapes placed side by side will make this effect work as long as they stay in contact.\n So that's why in a lot of the videos you see there's a watch glass. So the reason the watch glass is there is to keep the grapes together. Now with the very strong electromagnetic fields at the intersection of the two grapes, what you can get is some sparks, some breakdown of\n air. That is, the electric fields are strong enough that they ionize the air creating those sparks and that is what leads to the plasma. It creates these ions which can then receive more energy from the microwaves. You can see\n You can see it here pulsing at 120 Hz, that's twice the 60 Hz frequency of mains power, which reflects the fact that the amplitude of the microwaves is pulsing twice every cycle. And what is that plasma made of?\n Scientists looked at the spectrum of the plasma from a grape and they found that there's a strong potassium emission line and also a sodium emission line. So it seems like those ions must be pretty common in the grape and when the plasma gets\n formed is those ions which are sprayed up into the air and that is what we're seeing. Now the size of the grapes is important which is something I of course suspected because you don't see this happening with too many other squishy fruits.\n But you don't have to get them the exact right size and this is because water absorbs microwaves. So the scientists did some modeling of this and if you had a material inside the grape that\n did not absorb microwaves, then what you would see is at certain particular sizes you get extreme amplification of the electromagnetic fields. It's basically one size that you'd have to hit to get the amplification. But,\n So in terms of like applications of this research,\n research, what do you think? I mean, obviously, people like me are excited because this is a fun trick. But beyond that, what do you think in terms of applications of this? They may limit in fabricating microchips right now and going\n This phenomenon shows that two spheres of the right size and refractive index can focus electromagnetic energy down to a tiny spot in between them.\n to around a millimeter from radiation with a 12 centimeter wavelength. If similar focusing could be achieved with light it would provide a significant improvement over current lithography techniques. So if we could somehow harvest these to do\n So this lithography to be able to maybe write things very small, you could actually use light to make really small features. You could do like 2 nanometers, mark spots with about 2 nanometers resolution. It would help continue this like Moore's law.\n Yes, it will help you continue more slowly, like putting small things in a single chip. So I'm glad I was finally able to explain how this effect works. Did you enjoy it? Do you feel like you get it? Any questions?\n them in the comments below. Also I really like this video that I made this is my previous video and so if you haven't seen it go check it out. I'll also put a link to the original grape video which is maybe not that good because it was eight years ago but anyway thanks for watching.\n you"

            "transcription": "I'm here at the Mount Stromlo Observatory to talk to one of this year's Nobel Prize winners for physics, Professor Brian Schmidt.\n It doesn't seem quite to match up. Well that's an extraordinary honor, so congratulations to you. So can you tell us why have you been awarded this prize? So in 1998, Adam Reese, who's one of the other co-recipients and I, working with the team\n of 18 other people discovered that the universal expansion, the cosmic expansion of the universe was speeding up. And that was the wrong direction. We had expected gravity to cause the universe to slow down. And so the fact that the universe was speeding up\n meant that gravity was not working as we had expected. And we think that's because about 73% of the universe is something we call dark energy, something we didn't know existed before, and that causes gravity to push rather than pull. Does it actually cause gravity to change?\n Well, it means that we always think that gravity always pulls, but according to Einstein, the way gravity works really depends on the material itself and energy tied to space, gravity pushes, it doesn't pull. So do we have any sort of hints at\n as to what this energy in space could be? So why is this result so remarkable?\n Are people so excited about it? You know, it's big. When you discover 73% of everything there is, that's overturning what we expected. It's not even normal stuff. It's weird stuff. And so I think it highlights\n Either that we were just missing this huge part of the universe before or that somehow gravity and quantum mechanics, which we know we don't have a theory for, are playing tricks with physics in a way that we don't quite have sorted out. So I guess some of the hope is\n is that maybe we can use these observations to probe the link between gravity and quantum mechanics and hopefully potentially sort that out. Have you heard about this study that says that Nobel Prize winners live a few years longer than similar\n scientists who are shortlisted for the prize but don't actually win. Wow I have not heard that. How are you feeling? Are you feeling healthier now? No actually I'm not feeling, I'm kind of feeling stressed. We'll see maybe... In the long term I think it should pay off. Well I'm hoping it's because of all the good\n wine and things I get to drink. Of course. Alright, well thank you so much for having a chat with me today. Yeah, my pleasure. Appreciate it."

Which are light? Yes, they are. It lights up the room. It makes it not dark. What's the difference between blue light and red light? The color. It goes in your eyes and then you see stuff.\n They range from white to red to orange to green. It's like the chakras of your body. Can you see my aura? No, not particularly right now. Is it too bright out? It's very sunny out here today. Does that make it harder to see someone's aura? Not necessarily.\n If I was to explain it to a blind person, right, it would be the difference. You see nothing whatsoever as a blind person, whereas I see things in front of me.\n question of what light is, is not an easy one. For centuries, the greatest minds in science debated this issue. In the late 1600s, Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles, or corpuscles. He proposed this in his treatise Optics. But at\n At the same time, a Dutch physicist named Huygens proposed that light was a wave, and this debate raged on until it was settled by the experiment I've recreated today. Thomas Young's double slit experiment. To make sure I got the experiment right, I went to the\n original source. With the help of Brady Herron, I managed to get into the vault underneath the Royal Society in London. There I found Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803. I brought into the Sunbeam a slip of a card about when\n 30th of an inch in breadth and observed its shadow either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances. Besides the fringes of colors on each side of the shadow, the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes of smaller dimensions.\n This is an experiment so simple that you could make it at home and yet so fiddly that I have never seen it before done with sunlight. I was thinking about doing it in a box like a like a fridge box. And you can take it out on the street. Taking it out on the street.\n Could I possibly interview you guys for about a minute? We're doing a science experiment. I have here is an empty box. And this is a little eyepiece where we can look in and this is a hole. And I'm going to place this slide above that hole. And if you look closely, you'll see that there's two openings.\n very narrow opening side by side it's a double slit now before we have a look we need to tilt it towards the Sun a little bit so we want the Sun to hit this double slit directly what are we gonna see on the bottom of the box? The obvious thing you think you're gonna see is you can see two lines.\n lines on the bottom of the box. Two bright bands. Two little lines. I think it'll be one line instead of two. I can expect to see the whole box lit up. Probably a kaleidoscope of some sort. A bunch of colours. Probably, yeah. Rainbow, different colours. There, have a look.\n You expected to see kind of one line Is that what you see? No, I see dots how many it's one circle Well, there's one there's one in the middle strongest to either side the two on the outside of multicolored the one on the middle\n middle is just white. It's kind of a rainbow. The rainbow of colour as well. Quite a few colours and lots of little dots. Like there are more dots appearing. I think I can even see more dots spreading along. Yeah, that's amazing.\n Yeah, I can see tons of dots now. Not tons, but I can see dots spreading across that way. Yeah, definitely. Isn't that amazing? Yeah, that's incredible. And that's just nothing else apart from two slits.\n That's incredible. But all we're doing is we're putting a light through two very narrow slits side by side. So how does this make any sense?\n There's some kind of principle involved there that the average person is not familiar with. That's the only explanation. I'm really confused by it, but I'd like to find out why. People were debating, is light a wave or is it made of particles? So what causes that?\n If light were behaving as particles, you would expect them to go through each slit and just produce a bright spot underneath, so we would see two bright spots on the bottom of the box. But if light's behaving as waves, then the wave from one slit can interact with the waves from the other slit. I've got to demonstrate\n Here on a little pond where we can see this with water waves I have two sources of ripples Which are basically like the two slits when I create ripples with a single source they travel out with circular wave fronts nothing particularly surprising\n rising there. But if I add a second source of ripples then we start getting an interesting pattern. This pattern is created by the ripples from the two sources\n interacting with each other. Where they meet up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, the amplitude of the wave is increased. That's what we call constructive interference. But if the peak from one wave meets up with the trough from the other, then we get destructible\n interference and there's basically no wave there. And this is exactly what was happening with the light. When the light from one slit met up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, they constructively interfered and produced a bright spot. But if the trough from the wave from one\n slit met up with the peak of the way from the other slit they would destructively interfere and you wouldn't see any light there. It's light cancelling itself out. This is basically the same as like having two drops of water fall in a swimming pool. That's right. Exactly the same pattern. And then they're going over light.\n Now there's a slight complication which is that sunlight is composed of many different colors and they have different ways\n wavelengths, so obviously they're going to meet up at slightly different points. And that's what caused the rainbowing effects as we go further from the central maximum. You saw the ones to the right were slightly colored. That's because the reds are going to meet up at different places than the blues.\n the color differences are different wavelengths. Exactly. That's amazing. So the difference between the red and blue. So that red bin over there and the green part are just, I'm seeing that and it's just different wavelengths. And that's how we bring in all these beautiful colors all around us. Exactly. That's amazing. I'm amazed.\n I have been in license, literally.\n you\n Now you may have noticed in that experiment that the light on the bottom of the box was not in the shape of slits, rather they were more kind of round blobs. And I want to know why that is. Can you write an answer for me in the comment section? And I'll give you a hint.\n One of the videos I've linked kind of is suggestive of the answer. So convincing were the results of Young's double slit experiment that the scientific community concluded that light must be a wave. There is no way.\n it could be a particle."

But there's a cool trick you can do where if\n If you spin a raw egg and then you stop it, the raw egg will start spinning again. What's going on? Why does it keep spinning?\n Well, it's because of something pretty important to physics, which is called inertia. Inertia is the property that all objects have, which keeps them doing what they're doing. So when you get the egg spinning, the yolk inside is spinning as well.\n and if you stop it from the outside, if you stop the shell, the yolk keeps spinning inside so it'll get the egg spinning again without you having to touch it. Whereas with a hard-boiled egg, because the thing is solid inside, because the egg is solid,\n As soon as you stop the shell, you stop the whole egg and there is no more inertia to keep the egg spinning."

That is, there are areas, there are patterns of the vibration of the air where there's a lot of vibration in some parts and not very much vibration in other parts. Now that affects the flow rate of the gas inside that tube into the atmosphere.\n and so it affects the height of those flames. So basically you can visualize the standing wave pattern.

            "transcription": "Why do we get the seasons? The seasons? Because of the atmosphere? To be honest with you, that's a very easy question to answer now. We really don't get seasons anymore because of global warming. I think there was a time when I was a child where we definitely had four\n four seasons, but I think now we get summer, summer, summer and a little bit of winter in Australia. Is it to do with the earth turning and the equator, the four seasons? You mean like summer and winter?\n Doesn't it come from where we are around the sun and at that stage that's the season that we're in? I think the position of the Earth depending on the sun it's like if the Earth is standing other\n positions to the earth and there's winter, summer and in between there's autumn and spring. Because the earth rotates on an axis right and I think so it goes around on an axis\n Well obviously the Earth isn't spinning like that, it's sort of like on an angle. Because of the axis of the Earth rotating around its axis. Yeah, what does the axis do? It sends you further and closer to the Sun.\n For example, now the southern part, Australia is winter now and Europe is in the summer season and then the north side of the earth is standing more close to the sun.\n and the south side is like far away from that. It's because the earth is at a 22 degree tilt or something like that so as it goes around the sun that means that either the north or the southern\n and the hemisphere is close to the sun so that things are hotter or colder. When the earth goes around the sun it's not a circle, it's an ellipse, so you have different distance to the sun. So therefore the further the sun is away the colder it is in a country.\n It's because it's like an overall, it's not like perfectly circle. So the sun comes closer this way and then out further and gets closer. The elliptical pattern of the Earth and the distance from closer to the sun in summer and further.\n furthest away from it in the winter. Sometimes the sun is actually glancing the\n surface of the earth in certain regions and other times it's square on, like perpendicular. Well basically the sun's rays are more oblique at certain times of the year than at others. I think it's because of how the sun rays are like hitting, when they\n hit at an angle, it doesn't get that hard."

            "transcription": "A question I get asked surprisingly often is, is Veritasium a real element? Nope. I made it up. When I was a kid, about 10 or 11 years old,\n I went to this Genghis Khan exhibit at a museum and I didn't know much about Genghis Khan except he was some famous warrior who lived a long time ago so I was thinking maybe we'd see his mummified body or his suit of armor or his sword something like that but when I got to\n museum all they had were like these tiny fragments of pottery and some old shoes and I was incredibly disappointed. So in this video I want to tell you my story but with real pieces of my life.\n Real photons that bounced off my face hit a sensor, created a current that created a magnetic field, flipping some domains on magnetic tape, which was later replayed, recreating the current passed into a computer, digitized into zeros and ones, beamed at\n your device which recreates the light that's hitting your eyes right now. Now there is a direct path of particles from my four-year-old face to yours right\n now and there is nothing you can do to undo that. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada so I'm mostly Canadian, mostly because my family was South African.\n After my parents got married they moved to Vancouver where my two older sisters were born. But I was born in Australia and that's because my dad was working there\n as an engineer at a pulp and paper mill at the time. This is the first house where I ever lived. I lived there for the first 18 months of my life. Soon after, my family returned to Canada, and I guess I was a competitive kid because I graduated\n I did top of my class and had a full scholarship to go and study engineering at Queen's University. The problem was, I didn't really want to be an engineer. I wanted to be a filmmaker. But there isn't a straightforward path to becoming a filmmaker like there is for\n becoming an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer. Plus, your chance of success at filmmaking is very low, especially in the year 2000, when your best bet is probably to become a PA and try to catch a break somewhere. It didn't feel like American\n or like your life was in your own hands. So what did I do? Well, I did the smart thing. I took the scholarship and completed a degree in engineering physics. You know, some people\n People seem to think it's strange to have interests in both science and film. But to me, they are both incredible ways of getting at the truth. I mean, film records everything exactly as it happens, and it never changes, so it's like this\n perfect observation. So you can't fool yourself later, like about how I felt stifled by four years of engineering. Now while I was at college, I did take a few film production courses, as many as I could\n squeeze into my engineering timetable. My final project was a film about someone who is really good at math but really wants to be an artist. So that's really painfully autobiographical. I also made videos with\n my engineering friends but they always wanted to do something with a gimmick like vampires, ninjas, bigfoot, privatize, pirates. The videos weren't very good and we didn't even post them to YouTube. Why not?\n Well because YouTube didn't exist yet. So after the engineering degree I decided to move to Australia and go to film school. See the Lonely Planet Guide and the film school application on my desk? I'm leaving in five days and I've done\n and barely anything to get ready. But once I got to Australia, I figured I needed to get a job and get some film experience before I could make a decent application. I mean, they weren't just going to accept this Canadian engineer with some ridiculous videos.\n And on my sixth day in the country I auditioned for and got a role in this play at the University of Sydney. And then I started asking around about physics tutoring work and within a couple weeks I had enrolled in a PhD in the School of Physics.\n It seems like a kind of funny place to be in given that I came here to do film but after a short time I realized how much I still liked learning and how much I liked physics and I was hoping that I could meld the two, physics and film.\n PhD about how to make films that actually teach physics.

            "transcription": "A question I get asked surprisingly often is, is Veritasium a real element? Nope. I made it up. When I was a kid, about 10 or 11 years old,\n I went to this Genghis Khan exhibit at a museum and I didn't know much about Genghis Khan except he was some famous warrior who lived a long time ago so I was thinking maybe we'd see his mummified body or his suit of armor or his sword something like that but when I got to\n museum all they had were like these tiny fragments of pottery and some old shoes and I was incredibly disappointed. So in this video I want to tell you my story but with real pieces of my life.\n Real photons that bounced off my face hit a sensor, created a current that created a magnetic field, flipping some domains on magnetic tape, which was later replayed, recreating the current passed into a computer, digitized into zeros and ones, beamed at\n your device which recreates the light that's hitting your eyes right now. Now there is a direct path of particles from my four-year-old face to yours right\n now and there is nothing you can do to undo that. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada so I'm mostly Canadian, mostly because my family was South African.\n After my parents got married they moved to Vancouver where my two older sisters were born. But I was born in Australia and that's because my dad was working there\n as an engineer at a pulp and paper mill at the time. This is the first house where I ever lived. I lived there for the first 18 months of my life. Soon after, my family returned to Canada, and I guess I was a competitive kid because I graduated\n I did top of my class and had a full scholarship to go and study engineering at Queen's University. The problem was, I didn't really want to be an engineer. I wanted to be a filmmaker. But there isn't a straightforward path to becoming a filmmaker like there is for\n becoming an engineer or a doctor or a lawyer. Plus, your chance of success at filmmaking is very low, especially in the year 2000, when your best bet is probably to become a PA and try to catch a break somewhere. It didn't feel like American\n or like your life was in your own hands. So what did I do? Well, I did the smart thing. I took the scholarship and completed a degree in engineering physics. You know, some people\n People seem to think it's strange to have interests in both science and film. But to me, they are both incredible ways of getting at the truth. I mean, film records everything exactly as it happens, and it never changes, so it's like this\n perfect observation. So you can't fool yourself later, like about how I felt stifled by four years of engineering. Now while I was at college, I did take a few film production courses, as many as I could\n squeeze into my engineering timetable. My final project was a film about someone who is really good at math but really wants to be an artist. So that's really painfully autobiographical. I also made videos with\n my engineering friends but they always wanted to do something with a gimmick like vampires, ninjas, bigfoot, privatize, pirates. The videos weren't very good and we didn't even post them to YouTube. Why not?\n Well because YouTube didn't exist yet. So after the engineering degree I decided to move to Australia and go to film school. See the Lonely Planet Guide and the film school application on my desk? I'm leaving in five days and I've done\n and barely anything to get ready. But once I got to Australia, I figured I needed to get a job and get some film experience before I could make a decent application. I mean, they weren't just going to accept this Canadian engineer with some ridiculous videos.\n And on my sixth day in the country I auditioned for and got a role in this play at the University of Sydney. And then I started asking around about physics tutoring work and within a couple weeks I had enrolled in a PhD in the School of Physics.\n It seems like a kind of funny place to be in given that I came here to do film but after a short time I realized how much I still liked learning and how much I liked physics and I was hoping that I could meld the two, physics and film.\n PhD about how to make films that actually teach physics. Now I know that sounds incredibly relevant now, but at the time it didn't really satisfy either of my passions in physics or film. I know because this is me the night the\n The matter first starts coming in from students watching videos that contain misconception.\n After I got my PhD, I applied to the film school and got rejected.

Well, dark eyes, skin, and hair contain a molecule called melanin, and melanin absorbs a\n wide range of wavelengths of light, especially in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. And this makes it an ideal shield against the sun's harmful rays, which is why you get a tan when you go out in the sun. That's your body producing and releasing more melanin in the skin.\n But the idea with laser hair removal is to get the melanin in dark hairs to absorb the laser light without the skin around it absorbing much of that energy. So it actually works best if you have really dark hairs and light skin. Infrared lasers are commonly used because melanin\n Melanin absorbs in this part of the spectrum more than other common molecules in the skin like water and oxyhemoglobin. Red lasers at 755 nanometers are also often used for the same reason. As the melanin absorbs the laser energy the hair heats up to well over a hundred\n degrees Celsius causing it to burn and vaporizing the water it contains and this puffs the hair up a little bit like a Cheeto. It's that expanding water vapor. Looking closely at this shot you can actually see the bubbles on the hair from the vaporization of water.\n But the objective is not to destroy the hair, it's to actually use the hair to destroy the germ cells in the follicle that produce the hair in the first place. So it's kind of like using the hair to kill the hair.\n The image shows a cross section of three hair follicles following a laser hair removal treatment. The one in the middle contained little melanin and therefore shows no damage. The other two show the hair shaft has been destroyed, rupturing the inner root sheath and damaging the outer root sheath.\n Cells suffer damage when their temperature rises above 60 degrees Celsius. This is because at that temperature the bonds in proteins and collagen molecules start breaking apart and that's a process known as denaturation. So the hotter it is and the longer that temperature is maintained\n the more denaturation occurs and the higher the likelihood that that cell will die. Now if you cause enough damage to the cells in the follicle that make the hair, the hair will never grow back. And that is the goal of laser hair removal. The sequence of\n of ultra-short pulses is used to ensure that the heat doesn't spread too far into the region surrounding the hair. So the idea is the hair heats up, damages the germ cells right next to it, but then the laser light turns off before that heat can spread too much further. And then you hit the hair with\n another very short pulse again. If you were instead just to keep heating the hair it would heat not only the germ cells around it but also your skin that you don't want to damage and you would end up with burns. So that's the reason for the series of pulses that we saw. But if\n If you think about it, this is kind of a weird irony. I mean, melanin is a molecule meant to protect us, meant to protect our skin from harsh rays of sunlight, and that's why it absorbs that light before it can penetrate further into your body and do damage. But now with laser hair removal,\n So we're using melanin, its unique absorption powers against it by overpowering it with lots of laser energy. We get it to heat up the hair to such high temperatures that the hair kills the neighboring cells, the germ cells in the follicle that\n the hair. So we are using melanin's powers against it. Normally before a laser hair removal procedure the hair is shaved and that serves a few purposes. For one thing not too much energy goes into burning the external hair which\n does you know good in the first place and second it prevents the hot hair from landing on the skin causing surface burns. But we found that shave patches were less interesting to watch because you can't really see what's happening under the skin. After the creation of the first working laser in 1960, its inventor, Theodore\n Theodor Manon called it a solution looking for a problem. And unwanted hair may just be that problem, because laser hair removal is the most requested cosmetic procedure.\n I have a lot of people to thank who made this video possible like Diana physics girl whose idea this was Thanks to her. I no longer have that strange patch of hair on my shoulder So you should really go check out her channel a physics girl, and I also want to thank Darren without him\n at Beyond Slow Motion. We would never have been able to do this. He was simply amazing. So you should also check out Beyond Slow Motion. And of course, I want to thank Audible, the leading audiobook provider with hundreds of thousands of titles in all areas of literature, including fiction, nonfiction and periodicals.\n Whenever I'm out, I'm on the go and I can't really watch videos like when I'm driving, then I listen to Audible. And I also listen to Audible when I'm on the plane. And I'm about to get on a plane right now and fly to Svalbard, Norway, which is nearly the North Pole. And that is going to be a very long flight.\n I will definitely be listening to my audiobooks. In fact, the audiobook I'm listening to at the moment is called Creativity, Inc. I am learning a lot from this book about how to be a creative person and how to be productive. It's a great book to listen to.\n to\n trial by going to audible.com slash Veritasium. You know one of the reasons audible keeps supporting Veritasium is because they know that the people who watch this channel like learning things and another way to learn things besides YouTube is to listen to audiobooks. So I highly recommend you give them a try for 30-day free\n If you want to do that, go to audible.com slash veritasium. Thank you so much for watching."

            "transcription": "So tonight I'm hanging out with my friend Nigel and he's brought along one of his science toys, a little white plastic ball. It's not actually a white plastic ball at all. You told me you were bringing the white plastic ball tonight. It's, what colour would you call that? I would call it...\n It's a purple, it's a purple ball. Purple really? You see purple there? I'm not good with colours, I don't know if you want me to say fuchsia, but it's purple. Well it's interesting you say that, there is light in there, but it is actually a red, blue and green light.\n light. But it looks purple. No, there's definitely a red, blue and green light in there. Alright, well how are we going to settle this debate? I can show you that it is red, blue and green. How are you going to do that? By twirling it in a circle. Simple. You're going to twirl that in a circle and I'll\n All of a sudden I'm going to see that it's red, blue, and green. I promise you nothing less. Okay, that's a pretty good promise. Let's see it. Wow. Okay, so I'm not too big of a person.\n to admit when I'm wrong and I see a red green and blue balls around the outside of the circle but when you slow it down it goes back to being purple yeah it's actually everyone will see it being purple because\n the red, blue and green lights are turning on and off so quickly after each other that your brain actually merges it into one colour when the ball is in one place. So the eye actually kind of holds the information there about what colour it's seeing for an instant longer than it's there and\n and it merges together to produce that purple color. Yeah, that red, blue and green kind of merge to this dusty violet color. Dusty violet? You know your colors, so... Why can we see them separated when you swirl it in a circle?\n I'm actually getting the ball to switch colors to red, to green, to blue at different points in space. So at different points in space, your eye is not actually holding that image as it switches to a different color. Right, so even if the eye\n remembers the color that it's seen, it's not going to merge with the next color because that occurs at a different point in space. Exactly. So it's much easier to see the red, blue, and green lights happening in the ball than it is when it's still. So can you think of some practical applications\n occasions for this? I cannot. But it's a lot of fun for a Saturday night out, right? It is a lot of fun for a Saturday night out in a dark alley. So try that at your next party. Next party trick. Yeah, that's a good party trick. Well let's go... You can get a lot of parties as you can.\n Let's go crash some parties. We're gonna be a big hit with this thing. High fives. I'm not surprised that no one wanted to be interviewed by us. I am. This is awesome.\n This is awesome. This is awesome."

            "transcription": "Tonight we're going to show you a candle trick that you can use to impress your date at your next candlelit dinner. What we're going to show you is how you can light a candle without touching the wick. Okay, so Nigel's going to light up a wooden splint here. I'm going to blow out\n this candle and then we're going to relight the candle without touching the wick. Ready? I'm ready when you are. 1, 2, 3. You see that? It's just that easy. Maybe we should have a look at that in slow motion.\n So you can see that the flame is actually traveling from the splint back down to the wick. So what's going on there? Well what's happening is that this trick is utilizing the states of matter in the candle. So most people are familiar with the fact that a candle is made of solid wood.\n And when there's a flame burning in there, you can see there's a pool of liquid wax. But with the flame burning around the liquid wax, we're actually getting a lot of wax vapor. And it's the wax vapor which is actually burning, not the wick. Exactly. So when we blow the flame\n at the wick there is still that wax vapor hanging around. Yeah we can relight the wax vapor above the wick and you can watch that flame kind of travel down through that wax vapor back to the wick and relight the candle. Exactly. So as a final\n part of our trick why don't we try to blow all three out and relight them in one go. Yes and you can use this to rekindle your romance.\n Blue yet?"

This is a slinky. That is a that is an excellent slinky. We should drop that one. We want to see whether a long\n slinky and we're 15 meters up here whether a long slinky works the same as a short slinky. Because some people on YouTube don't really believe that it's going to work the same or they want to see it. We're about to find out. All right I'll go film it from the grass and you drop the slinky. Fine. Okay.\n The first two are the same.\n The first time I saw this, I was surprised.\n Here you go Rod. Did you see it? Yeah that was a good drop. Did you get it? I don't know I think so we got to check the cameras. Well I think it it tended to be\n tumble and it's got right down to the bottom. I think it's going too fast and tumbling. I think we better do that one again. We're gonna do it again? Yeah. All right.\n The first time I saw the sun, I was surprised.\n Thanks Derek. Oh, not a problem. I saw that it still tumbles when it gets to the end. Yeah. It's clear to me that you wouldn't want to be sitting at the end of this under an aeroplane. No, definitely not. No, much better time.\n Yes it is.\n Well, in the rest frame it's staying at rest, so you don't need that explanation. True, why not just take gravity out of the equation?\n When I hit the right hand end of the spring, the left hand end doesn't move until the compression wave travels down the\n length of the spring and changes the tension at that end. Yeah, so it's about the same thing as the slinky but obviously there's no gravitational force involved there. Correct. Cool. Alright, well thanks so much. We have learned a lot about slinkies. My pleasure.\n Shhhhhh"

I'm going to put this corn starch and water solution on this speaker.\n But I want to do this scientifically, so I'm shooting it with a high speed camera and I'm going to vary the frequency and the amplitude and see what factors really give us the best cornstarch monster. Nice. Still very much looks like a liquid at this point, but as I increase the amplitude,\n You can kind of tell that it's not moving as smoothly as it should anymore. You can see at this amplitude, it starts to jump around a little bit.\n Now I want to try to increase the frequency and see what effect that has.\n We are now at about 20 hertz, which is the frequency recommended by some scientific papers that have studied this phenomenon. I'm going to up the amplitude a little bit.\n That is incredible! That is awesome!\n I'm going up to about\n 22 Hertz Seeing nicer structures But it's really tough to tell because it's somewhat random sometimes it just turns into a blob like that other times you get some really cool things I'm at about 34 Hertz here, and we're not seeing a lot of structure\n It seems like at these higher frequencies it just sort of turns into a blob.

Well the corn starch in water is really a suspension, that is these tiny little grains of starch suspended in water.\n So when you try to move that fluid slowly, the starch has time to get out of the way of each other because it's lubricated by all those water molecules in between. But if you try to get it to go fast, and that is there's a lot of shear, which means there's some places that are going faster than others,\n Well then all of the starch grains kind of get stuck up against each other and they can't flow past each other So at that point it becomes like a solid and less like a liquid You know this kind of reminds me of traffic in LA where I've been recently if there are not that many cars on the road it's\n is\n gets clogged and you're basically in what is a solid. So traffic might be an example of something that's a non-Newtonian fluid. It flows very well when there aren't very many particles or when it's going quite slowly, but as you try to increase the number of cars and go really\n fast then everything kind of gets clogged up.\n you"

Regulation means you apply pressure to ice and so it turns into water but when that pressure is removed it turns back into ice.\n I have two pairs of 1.5 kilogram weights.

            "transcription": "In my last video we performed an experiment in which two identical wood blocks were shot with the same rifle. One through the center of mass and the other one slightly off to one side. Now if you haven't seen that video yet then click here now and go and watch it.\n on a mobile device click the link in the description. So the question was compared to the block shot straight through its center how high would the block shot to one side go? Now 60% of you predicted that it wouldn't go\n is high didn't seem as high now check out the high speed footage oh no you can clearly see that both blocks go to the exact same height oh come on 19 percent\n said that it would go higher and only 21% correctly predicted that both blocks would go to the exact same height. So most of us got it wrong the first time around and that includes Henry and me and Destin who has a lot of experience with this stuff. I mean I can't tell you how\n times I've hit wood with a rifle. So even experienced and intelligent people get it wrong sometimes. In this case I think the result was particularly counterintuitive because the spinning block clearly ended up with more energy than the other block. So I asked you guys to make\n make me a video response and explain what is happening. And this is what I received.\n Whoa! That is a lot of video responses and that's not even all of them. I've got to say I was blown away by all of\n of the great video responses I received, you guys are awesome and I really really appreciate all the effort you went to. You know some of you actually replicated the experiment perhaps with different setups.\n I\n That was my proudest moment making this YouTube channel. Seeing all of you guys doing science and getting so involved and putting in so much effort, it just blows my mind. It's amazing. Thank you guys so much. Thank you, thank you. I can't even put it into words how awesome.\n it is. So what is the answer? How could two identical blocks shot with the same rifle end up with different amounts of energy? Well some of you felt that the amount of rotational energy would be basically insignificant. What if\n If the amount of energy necessary to get that very small block rotating really is negligible in comparison to the amount of energy necessary to lift it into the air and resist gravity. Well we can calculate it.\n Because the spinning block was rotating at about 11 times per second. So you can calculate that its rotational energy would be equal to 50% of the gravitational potential energy when those blocks were at their peak. So the spinning block actually had 1.5 times\n the energy of the non-rotating block and in my books that is not negligible. So what else could be causing this? Well some of you actually measured the height difference using pixel counters and found that the blocks didn't go to exactly the same height.\n So this raises an important question, which is how different would those heights have to be before you can think that there really is a difference there? Well, given that the rotational energy is about 50% of the gravitational potential energy, you might expect the spinning block to go half as high.\n But looking at the video footage you can clearly see it doesn't go half as high it goes basically to the same height. To know for sure you'd probably want to do the experiment a number of times. In science you got to repeat things and make sure what you saw is not just a fluke that will happen every\n every time. So in fact we did repeat the experiment a number of times and here are all of the blocks lined up side by side so you can compare their heights. The\n blocks clearly do not all go to the same height. So you might say, Derek, you were tricking us. You just picked the two that went the closest and used those. It's true, I did do that. But the point is, do the spinning blocks go systematically to a lower height than the non-spinning blocks?\n And I think from the video footage the answer is clearly no. So why not? Well, another common response I saw was that air resistance must play a role. That the spinning block exposes a smaller surface area as it's traveling upwards\n And this means there's less air resistance impeding it so even with a lower velocity it could make it to the same height as the non-spinning block. But you can do the calculation and find that the difference in air resistance would be at most about 0.6% of the weight\n of the block. In other words, negligible. So what is the real answer? Well, there are a number of ways of approaching the problem and I saw you guys try almost all of them. Force, torque, momentum, energy. But the easy\n The easiest one of these is the law of conservation of momentum. You see, when the bullet is fired out of the rifle, it has a certain amount of momentum entirely in the vertical direction. And when the bullet becomes lodged in the block, the bullet and block together must have that same\n momentum that the bullet had. Now it doesn't matter where on the block the bullet hits because the bullet had a certain momentum before it hit the block the block and bullet together afterwards must have that amount of momentum upwards so this means regardless of whether the block is spinning\n or not it must have the same upwards velocity so that it has the same momentum. So it will go to the same height regardless of whether it's spinning or not. It is simple conservation of momentum. Momentum is always always conserved. It is something you can\n can always rely on and it's why you should think about it first. But some of you may say, okay well there's also angular momentum in the spinning block. But the point is angular momentum and linear momentum are independent and they're conserved independently. So you can simply think about\n the upward momentum of the bullet and that's going to have to be the upward momentum of those two blocks and it doesn't matter that one's spinning because they have the same total linear momentum upwards so they have to go to the same height. But if that is the case, why does the spinning block end up with this extra\n Well, the thing about energy is it's a little bit tricky. Although total energy is conserved, the energy of motion, which is called kinetic energy, is not conserved. So what happens is, as the bullet strikes the wood,\n A lot of its kinetic energy is lost, heating up the wood, creating sound and deforming that wood block. So it would be possible for the rotating block to end up with more energy of motion, more kinetic energy, if the bullet loses less energy, deforming the wood block.\n forming the wood and heating it up and creating that sound. And this kind of makes a little bit of intuitive sense because if you imagine the bullet entering the block on the side, the block will be moving away from it faster because it's rotating. So that may mean that the bullet\n doesn't penetrate in as far and so it wouldn't lose as much energy as it's entering the wood which explains why the block has extra energy allowing it to rotate and go the same height as the other block. Let's have a look at how far in the bullet went into each block. This is a\n our first test. Here we go. This is the one where I went straight in. This is where the bullet went in off center.\n Yeah, let's see the other one. Okay. There it is, all the way in. There it is, part way in. So the bullet didn't go as far into the spinning block. So that was\n That's pretty convincing evidence, but just to be extra sure, we x-rayed both blocks, and this is what we saw. I'm going to overlay the blocks so we can see the difference in penetration depth. Hang on, it looks like both bullets penetrated each block to the same\n depth. So does that mean our theory is wrong? Well let's think about how different the bullet depths should be. I mean when the bullet strikes the block it actually loses 97% of its original kinetic energy. And the amount of rotation\n The rotational energy the spinning block has only works out to about 1% of the original kinetic energy of the bullet. So we would only expect the difference in depths of about 1%. And for our measurements that would be about a tenth of a millimeter.\n be immeasurable and that is what we see. So although this answer is a little bit unsatisfying, at least it is the truth. As an extra challenge, I want you guys to think about how we could perhaps modify this experiment so that\n difference in bullet depth would be measurable. You can leave your answer in the comments or make me another video response because I love those so much.

            "transcription": "Shh. I've snuck into MinutePhysics Studio to explain how a wing actually works. Hang on. Something doesn't feel right. Ah, that's better. Now everyone knows that a wing generates\n lift due to its characteristic shape. Since air travels farther over the top of the wing, it must go faster than the air underneath so that both streams meet up simultaneously at the trailing edge. And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster flowing air exerts less pressure\n than the slower air beneath the wing. This pressure difference creates an upward force, lift. Job done, right? Nope. This simple explanation, taught in many textbooks and classrooms, has obvious problems, like how could a plane fly upside down?\n Some planes, like the Wright brothers, had nearly flat wings, so presumably air would travel the same speed over both sides and there would be no lift. Plus, experiments show that air streams don't meet up at the back of the wing. Air over the top goes significantly faster, reaching the trailing edge.\n edge first. So how does a wing actually generate lift? Well the key is the wing must deflect air downwards. This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered airfoils or by increasing the angle of attack. Air under the wing is deflected\n down, and by the Coanda effect, air above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well. Since the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing, it pushes the wing up and back, lift and drag. This is in accordance with Newton's\n law of motion. But hang on, if you can explain lift only using the deflection of air and Newton's laws, then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely wrong. Well, no. Air over the top of the wing does go faster than air beneath, creating a pressure difference that generates\n lift, then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary rubbish and the original explanation was right. But that's not true either. The original explanation incorrectly assumed that air over and under the wing must reconnect at the trailing edge and there was no mention of deflecting air\n down. Each explanation done correctly completely accounts for the lift generated by a wing. They're just two different ways of looking at the same thing. So next time someone brings up the standard misconception, you can tell them that explanation just doesn't fly.\n And if you like that, you've gotta check out MinutePhysics. I have total respect for a guy who does this every week. Sincerely, a collection of particles known as Derrick.\n you\n you"

Well this is what's exciting is only a few blocks from here was the lab of a guy called Faraday. In October 1831 he built the world's first electric generator here. Magnet which you push and pull, you're now out of a coil.\n generate which count so that's the actual yeah for world's first generation and there's a permanent magnet in the middle of magnet yeah it was Faraday who realized that it's a changing magnetic field that actually can generate electric current so as the magnet is falling through the pipe\n It's creating a changing magnetic field that generates little electric currents, so-called eddy currents in the pipe, and they create an opposing magnetic force on the magnet, slowing it down. So it actually turns the\n pipe into an electromagnet which pushes the magnet up. And this is what's known as electromagnetic induction. So it causes my LED to light up there. But it's important that you move the magnet quickly because if you move it too slowly\n The magnetic field is not changing fast enough to generate enough voltage to light this LED. This is actually the way all electricity is generated. Is it? Yeah. You move a magnet near a conductor and it creates electric current. But where is this electrical energy coming from?\n You can't get energy for nothing. Well, Faraday realized that there must be a force pushing back on the magnet. It's the same force that slows this magnet down as it falls through the pipe. So there's actually energy being converted from gravitational potential energy into electrical energy.\n energy and eventually the heat. So this pipe is warming up by taking some of the energy out of the falling magnet. Is that any good or what? Oh, it's very good. This way. And these currents coming around this way will induce a\n magnetic field pushing in the opposite direction.\n And then after that, we're gonna go to the fire there."

            "transcription": "Okay, so we're going for a ride around the pyramids. The Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years, only surpassed by a large margin by the Eiffel Tower in 1889.\n 147 meters high. You are interested by climbing? Yeah, let's climb it. But it's not free. How much? What makes the pyramids even more impressive is that these structures were built over 4,500 years ago.\n ago. When Egyptians didn't have wheels or steel, the only metal available was copper and copper alloys. It took about two million stones to build that pyramid. Well, I call them stones, giant rocks. Somewhere between one and a\n and three tons each. The pyramids took about 20 to 30 years to make. It's a long time, but if you think about the number of stones, a couple million stones in every pyramid, you'd have to be laying a stone roughly once every three minutes.\n If you consider a regular work day like a 10 hour or 12 hour work day. Nobody knows how they built it, it's still secret. But a lot of people try to do the best to give you some information about how they did it. But we must say it's secret. They did and they take the secret.\n No plans survived to show us how the pyramids were built. So perhaps it's not surprising that this is the subject of countless conspiracy theories involving aliens, time travel, or lost technologies.\n The less far-fetched myth, which has become widely accepted, that the pyramids were built by slaves. But recent discoveries suggest the pyramid builders were not slaves at all. They were skilled workers. Well-preserved tombs near the pyramids\n suggests that their hard labor and sacrifice were rewarded. If these workers had been slaves, they would not have received such honorable burials. But how did they actually manage to build the pyramids? One of the things I find really interesting is that the Egyptians didn't\n know about wheels. So they didn't really even use rollers as far as we can tell. I mean these rocks would have been carted across the desert on sleds. There's a famous diagram of this giant statue being pulled by 172 men and that that\n That statue would have weighed somewhere on the order of 68 tons or something. This would normally create a lot of friction, but the sand was wetted in front of the sled. Experiments show this would reduce the pulling force required by half. The internal stones\n of this pyramid are all limestone, which is a bit softer and easier to work. You can imagine them working it with those copper chisels that they had. Some of these blocks may have been actually sawed through using copper saws. Now you wouldn't think that copper could really cut\n rock but if you put an abrasive in there like a sand you could actually wear away the stone. Probably be a very difficult and labor-intensive job. Something that you don't really think about is that when you build a pyramid you need to build it on level ground. You can actually see there how they\n had to level out that ground, well it's speculated that when the Nile flooded they put the floodwater into a channel and see where the high parts were. So the inside was made of this limestone, the outside of this pyramid was actually made of granite. Much harder stone.\n I'm at the granite quarry in Aswan where they would have quarried the stones that were used in the pyramids at Giza. Now that is an incredible feat because this is nearly a thousand kilometers away from Giza and when the now flooded water would come right through here so that they could\n could move all the stones quarried here, this granite. They could move this back up to Giza and use it on the pyramids. These would have had to have been floated down on rafts. Now quarrying this would have been really hard. Granite is one of the hardest rocks because it contains\n quartz, and quartz on the hardness scale is about a seven where diamond is a ten. So how would you dig a massive trench like that? Basically the technique was just to smash the dollarite rock into the granite over and over\n and over again. They would make about five millimeters progress per hour. So there is no clear account of how the pyramids were actually built, but the best guess is that ramps were used. And in fact some ramps have been found on incompletely\n complete pyramids, but you can't build just a straight ramp, a long straight ramp and keep putting the rocks up. I mean the problem with that is the ramp actually ends up taking up more material than the pyramid itself. I think a ramp which sort of wraps around the pyramids is probably the most likely\n The top third of the height of the pyramid actually only accounts for about 4% of all the material in the pyramid. That's why it's suspected that levers were actually used to finish off the pyramid to do the top levels. Now the pyramids have clearly weathered but\n In the past they would have been a brighter white because they would have used a white limestone to cover the whole face of that pyramid. And then the very top may have been covered with electrum, which is a mixture of gold and silver. So if you can imagine\n That would be a pretty spectacular sight. The reason these pyramids are shaped this way is so they represent sun rays. Imagine what that would have looked like when it was first built with a shiny metallic top and smooth white finish on it.\n on all of those sides. I think that would have been a sight to behold. Hey, I hope you enjoyed that video. I filmed it earlier this year when I was in\n Egypt. Now I'm currently in Melbourne, Australia and tomorrow I am flying to the US. In fact next week I'm actually doing a live show in Alabama with Henry from MinutePhysics, Destin from Smarter Every Day, Brady Herron from Numberphile Periodic Videos and 60 Symbols and CGP Grey from Sea\n the\n I\n for their support.

It can carry some weight, hey? Yeah. That is amazing.\n So how does it work? Well, it's similar to how a magnet falling through a pipe is slowed down. Anytime a conductor experiences a changing magnetic field, electric currents are induced in it, which create a magnetic field to oppose that change. And in this case,\n the spinning magnets induce currents in the copper sheet. They create a magnetic field which is nearly a mirror image of the spinning magnets and so they're repelled. If the rotors spin fast enough, this repulsion leads to levitation. That is awesome!\n The induced currents then encounter resistance in the copper, so they dissipate their energy as heat.\n And this copper is pretty hot. It's gotten warmer. Yeah, I can still keep my hand on it Yeah for a second or two, but it is like like a hot mug of coffee or something Yeah, I experienced this before with another electromagnetic levitation device except with this one\n the changing magnetic field was created by an electromagnet in the base, inducing currents in a light aluminum plate, which levitated. The plate got so hot you could boil water on it. Check out how hot this plate is. If you have two nor-\n magnets facing each other. They normally just kind of like fall off. Is there a similar problem here or no? Not really no and the reason is the magnetic fields that are induced by currents in the copper sheet, a mirror image, are\n of the applied magnetic field and the effect is so quick that as it moves it just kind of follows it around. Making this device work in practice is harder than it looks. For one thing, the magnetic field of the permanent magnets has to be very strong.\n Neodymium magnets are strong, but there's a special configuration you can use to make them even stronger.\n magnetic field lines run from north to south and they're normally symmetric on both sides of a magnet but if you rearrange them like this the magnetic field lines are channeled almost entirely into one side of the magnetic array and they cancel out\n on the other side. This configuration produces a much stronger magnetic field without changing the properties of the magnets. In these rotors there are 12 wedge-shaped magnets. Their magnetic poles are fixed in this particular arrangement. This increases the magnetic field on the bottom side and\n and almost eliminates it on the top. As the magnets spin, they create a rotating magnetic field in the copper beneath them. This induces currents that create magnetic fields, which oppose the magnetic field of the spinning magnets above. The result is a repulsive force\n that is effectively lift for this quadcopter. But in addition to lift, there is also drag. Energy is clearly being dissipated in the system as the heat produced by the induced currents in the copper. And that energy comes from the fact the magnetic field of the induced currents\n is not a perfect mirror of the spinning magnets above. Instead, the induced magnetic poles are slightly ahead, so they produce a backward force on the rotors, which is really a backwards torque. And that's why the rotors on alternate corners have to spin in opposite directions.\n Because otherwise they would produce a net spin and turn the whole machine in one direction. This way they cancel out. This principle has been used to achieve levitation in everything from maglev trains to hoverboards. And it's being considered as a means to make\n the hyperloop, a superfast system for transporting people and goods through tubes at very low pressure. But instead of spinning the magnets, the vehicle's motion itself would cause the magnetic field to change in the conductive track below.\n we travel? I think like ongoing developments in digital motor controllers and very powerful magnets will mean that talking about moving humans and cargo at extremely high speeds is actually something that we can as a species kind of look at and be like, wow.\n It turns out that getting from one city to another city in the same day is something that the next billion or two billion people might have the opportunity to do in one lifetime.\n Patreon and by Audible.

            "transcription": "These are soft robots. Their structural components are built not out of metal or wood, but flexible materials like plastic tubing. But how do they work? And why would you want a soft robot?\n So I came up to Stanford to meet Zach Hammond and his soft robot.\n How's it going? All right, you want to tip it? So is the idea that the robot could walk this way? Totally, yeah. So you can kind of chain these rolls together to kind\n of roll around in any environment. They call this punctuated rolling locomotion wherein it's kind of stuck on a face until it tips over, now it's on a new face, and it can then continue to move its center of gravity. Once that center of gravity exits the support\n polygon or the base, then it tips over one of the edges of the face. This is a different soft robot made out of flexible tubing. It was designed to mimic the way a turtle walks, where diagonally\n opposite legs move together. It's powered entirely by compressed air, and perhaps most impressive, it requires no electronics. All of the circuitry is pneumatic, and this means the robot can be used in\n places like mines where electronics could spark explosions, or in the strong magnetic fields around MRI machines. But why would you want a soft robot in the first place? One of the things that I like to do is just to take the robot and kind of like...\n Well, because they're safer. For operation around humans, there's not much\n damage a soft robot can do to you.\n some maximum force that it could ever exert on me. So it's inherently safe to be operating around people. Could we make it fall and have me be inside it? Yeah, yeah we could do that for sure.\n Just watch your head. Yep, if I go over here. If you're there, yeah, we can do that. All right, let's try it. Here it comes. Well, that's not bad at all, is it? I can try another shape.\n supposed to open up one of the faces so you can jump out of it quickly. I haven't tested it in a little while so I don't know how it's gonna go but let's try this. There you go that's your face right there to your right and you can exit the truss from that face. Boom. Perfect.\n easy. Did you build this by yourself? Me and one other grad student built this entire thing ourselves basically. And how long did it take? We did it in about a month I want to say like actually constructing everything. And was it tricky? I mean were you sewing that stuff?\n Yep, we sewed this all ourselves. The main structural members of this robot are fabric tubes inflated with air. Yeah, so these red tubes are a nylon fabric and then internally there is a polyethylene tube that\n provides the air tightness. The tubes are inflated to about 6 psi above atmospheric so it's almost one and a half atmospheres. Each tube passes through pairs of rollers connected to a motor. The rollers pinch the\n tube so it bends kind of like a pinched straw. Add the rods and then we have this like high friction material wrapped around the rods and then that coupled with the fact that we have this pressurized tube that's kind of pushing the membrane of the tube into the rollers prevents us from slipping.\n By driving the motor, it changes the lengths of the tubes. Kind of like when a clown creates a twist in a balloon and then folds that balloon into a balloon animal. The difference between what the clown does and what we do is that there's some passage of air\n between adjacent segments of the tube so that as the robot drives around, we're not pressurizing the segments of the tube. This robot is made of four inflated tubes, each one connected to a pair of motors forming triangular sides. We also think that they\n kind of look like sausage links when put together, which is why we've named these robots after different sausages. So this one's called Polish. That one over there is chorizo. There's a lingui\u00e7a and a kielbasa over there somewhere. So what shape is the overall thing? It's an octagon.\n Yeah, we call it an octahedron because if you drew lines between these kind of kinematic joints here, it would create an octahedron shape. Driving the motors together allows the robot to dramatically change shape. It can get very tall\n or short and squat. But since the tubes themselves don't change in length, the overall perimeter of the robot, the length of all the edges combined, doesn't change. So the robot is considered isoparametric.\n How do you feel when you watch those Boston Dynamics videos? Oh, I love those videos. They're so cool. The Boston Dynamics robots are kind of terrifying. Isn't the idea with soft robots to convince people that robots are good and soft and kind and friendly?\n That's definitely true. Yeah, there are some things that you can do to rigid systems to make them feel like compliance systems based on how you're controlling the motors. But yeah, they're definitely, you know, heavy, expensive and can be dangerous if they're not used correctly.\n The hard robots we're used to are strong and precise. Their actions are accurate and repeatable. But they are also heavy and they can't really change their volume as dramatically. But this robot is still capable of\n of carrying a heavy load.\n Soft robots also have the advantage of shape changing. They can become tall to go over obstacles or short to fit under obstructions. So if there's some rock that it didn't see or that it wanted to roll over, it could simply do that in the\n the compliance of the tubes would simply just bend around that disturbance. Do you imagine robots like this doing work in space? Oh yeah, definitely. So one of the nice things about these types of structures is that they can shrink down their volume very\n drastically. And because volume on rockets is such an expensive premium, being able to have a robot that can pack down small for transport is very valuable. So NASA was at one point looking into trust robots for exactly that reason, and they've\n contacted us since we've made this robot to explore different ideas for space exploration projects. So one of the things that they're thinking about doing is deploying robots underneath a sheet of ice. So they're going to drill through this sheet of ice and then deposit a robot through\n what is a kind of a small diameter hole. And so if you can have a robot that can change its volume very drastically or be disassembled and then reassembled to form like a much larger structure, then you can have large robots that are able to fit through\n these tight spaces and be deployed in kind of difficult to access areas. Is this a little bit like an octopus? Is that how you can think of it? There is some connection there because they use their shape-changing ability and their compliance to squeeze through tight passageways and then also to\n to wrap their body around objects. So for example, they can open jars with their tentacles. And one of the things that we want to use this robot for is grasping and manipulating objects. This robot is even capable of picking objects up off the ground.\n We'll try that and see if it can grab it. Because of the compliance of the tubes, it has a natural ability to grasp and manipulate objects because as it does so, the tubes\n bend ever so slightly which increases the contact area and distributes evenly the forces that are exerted on that object. So I mean is the biggest risk if it pops? Yeah that's a big risk. I mean you obviously\n need the compressed air for your structure. And so if you have a leak, then you don't have a robot, right? It's a pretty big drawback of soft robots.\n You know, some things that you could do to mitigate that would be to have on board a small compressor, which isn't there to provide power to the robot, but would help you maintain pressure if there were any small leaks. When you tell someone you're working on a robot and they see this,\n Does it defy expectations? Totally. They have no idea what it is I'm talking about until I show them like a video or a picture. I think most people's conception of soft robots was really expanded by the movie Big Hero 6 and I think they did a great job\n job in kind of showcasing what a soft robot can do and why they're useful and kind of just popularizing the notion. It's really great to have compliance built into any mechanical system, especially as we want robots to work closer and closer with humans. So I think we'll definitely\n see more soft robots in the future.\n with a few designers who make the awesome projects that come in KiwiCo crates. And I'm not gonna lie, it kind of seems like the best job. I was in awe of some of the ideas they have brought to life. Dude, that's cool.

            "transcription": "I'm here at the National Institute for Standards and Technology and I'm about to see some of the original kilogram standards. When were these made? Well the originals were made in the 18th\n There were 40 of them that were brethren of the International Prototype Kilogram and these 40 were distributed to the signatories of the Treaty of the Meter and the United States was given two, K4 and K4.\n What was this meter agreement? The treaty of the meter? Yeah, what is that? It's the modern day foundation of the metric system. So the US signed that? The US signed it. As if they were going to become metric? Yes.\n It's a little known secret and I'll tell you something else that all the units that we commonly use like feet and gallons and so on are actually defined in terms of metric units. So it's just a little\n translation that we do here but our country is actually on the metric system. Doesn't that seem crazy? Yes it is! It's insane that like you base all of these measurements on the metric system and then you\n at a conversion factor and then later some people have to convert back. Yes, it's stupid. Are you allowed to say that? It's true. So can we see it? Sure. What do we have to do?\n This requires that we go through some high security gear and also that would be somewhat clean in what we do. So I'll have to ask you to put on some booties here. Let me see if I can do this. Alright. So. Did I do it? Yeah, there you go.\n This is the first booty butler that I've ever... I'm a big fan. So this is the first layer and...\n I'm going to show you two. I'm going to show you one of the originals and I'm going to show you a more modern version. This is K20.\n Virtually every mass that has been accurately weighed in the US over the past 130 years\n can trace its measurement back to this one kilogram hunk of 90% platinum 10% iridium. Iridium makes the alloy much harder than pure platinum and both elements were selected for their high density and resistance to oxidation. This kilogram was created in the\n way at around the same time as an object which to this day remains the definition of the kilogram, an identical cylinder stored in a basement vault on the outskirts of Paris. If you look straight down from the top you can maybe see\n The K20 doesn't have a very nice finish on it compared to the more modern prototypes. Here's K92, so it's got a much higher polish on it, different manufacturing techniques, absolutely no swirls.\n It is a really like beautiful looking specimen. Yes it is. I mean is there a reason why you want it to look so beautiful? Well you want it not to be very rough because roughness increases surface area. Surface area\n increases the probability that you will get contaminants on that will change the mass of the entire thing. How much is it worth? Well, monetarily the new ones are about a hundred thousand dollars a piece if you were to buy one.\n Oh my goodness. So, but if you think about K20, K4, with about 130 years of history, they're priceless. You could never replace them. The purpose of this room then is to share the precise mass of K20 with anyone who wants to make a\n measurement without sharing K20 itself.\n bigger than the platinum meridium prototypes and that's because of the relative difference in density. The density of stainless steel is about 8 grams per cubic centimeter whereas the density\n And that creates a problem. Ordinarily we don't worry much about the buoyant force,\n That is the upward force on every object in the atmosphere equal to the weight of air it displaces But since the volumes of these masses are so different a stainless steel object that has around the same mass as k20 can have its weight reduced due to buoyancy by around 110 milligrams\n The precise amount depends on the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the air. That's why the mass comparator itself is inside of a chamber here that's isolated from the outside world so that the temperature remains relatively stable and the humidity the same.\n Pressure is by far the biggest contributor to air density, so we don't want it changing all over the place with the weather. The problem scientists are having with the kilogram now is much bigger than weather fluctuations. It's something they discovered when all the original kilograms were returned to pair\n for a weigh-in, including K20. How does it get there? It gets there by a person hand carrying it. Each prototype gets taken out of its bell jar and put in its container.\n ugly sound. After we get it in there all nicely secured, then we wrap the whole thing in bubble wrap and put it in a camera bag.\n and sling it over our shoulders. Don't let it out of our sight. It sounds a little casual. So you actually like while you're on the plane, do you put it in like the overhead storage? No, no, no, no, no, no. No, it stays with us at all times like it's a,\n know the nuclear football the codes for setting off the nuclear weapons and you've never had any scares while you're carrying the the only scare comes if somebody wants to see it like a customs official I've never had to open it although I I had a kind of a scary moment\n and at one time when they asked me what it was made of and I told them it was platinum iridium and somebody heard the word iridium and connected that with radioactivity and kind of you know flew off the handle a little bit and I had to\n calm them down and assure them that it wasn't radioactive, there was no threat going on here. The real threat was the unreliable weight of the kilogram mass standard. What they do is a series of comparisons. They compare every one of those with the international prototype kilogram.\n Using that data and plotting it, it looked as if there had been a change in the international prototype that made it about 50 micrograms heavier than 1 kilogram, now over the course of 100 years.\n The interesting thing is if one looks at the data that was recently taken at the end of 2013, international prototype kilogram did not show an increasing mass. You're telling me for several decades it was gaining mass and all of a sudden it's\n stopped, which I find that hard to explain. But it seemed like all of the 40 masses seemed to be somewhat diverging at that way. And they went different ways. They went in different directions. Yes. So that some changed a lot.\n Some changed little, some hardly changed at all. But it's hard to tell. I mean they could all be changing a lot because all you can tell is the difference between them. All that matters is the difference between them and the international prototype because the international prototype\n is the only thing you need, the only thing that you really know because it's defined as one kilogram. Right, but I mean, outside of that definition, there's a chance it could have gained, you know, five grams as long as they all gained five grams. You know, obviously it's ridiculous.\n Obviously it's ridiculous, but the point is they could have all been gaining or they could have all been losing, right? It's a relative measurement and that's the weakness of the system. And that's why as of 2018 the kilogram will no longer be defined as the mass of\n a metal cylinder.\n you"

            "transcription": "This tiny robot weighs less than a tennis ball and can jump higher than anything in the world. In the competitive world of jumping robots, the previous record was 3.7 meters, enough to leap\n a single-story building. This jumper can reach 31 meters, higher than a 10-story building. It could jump all the way from the Statue of Liberty's feet up to eye level.\n For something to count as a jump, it must satisfy two criteria. First, motion must be created by pushing off the ground, so a quadcopter doesn't count, because it pushes off the air. And second, no mass can be created.\n be lost, so rockets constantly ejecting burnt fuel are not jumping, and neither is an arrow launched from a bow. The bow would have to come with the arrow for it to count as a jump. Many animals jump from sand\n The amount of energy delivered in that single stroke determines the jump height, so if you want to jump higher, you have to match the height of your body with the height of your body.\n maximise the strength of the muscle. The best jumper in the animal kingdom is the Galago, or Bush Baby. And that's because 30% of their entire muscle mass is dedicated to jumping. This allows the\n world-sized primate to jump over two meters from a standstill. It has like, you know, very small arms and upper body, and it's just like huge jumping legs. It doesn't have better muscles or anything, it just has more of them.\n There are some clever jumping toys. I used to play with these poppers as a kid, and when you deform a popper, you store energy in its deformed shape. Effectively, it becomes a\n spring, and then just like an animal, in one stroke it applies a large force to the ground, launching itself into the air. All elastic jumpers follow the same principle of\n of storing energy in a spring and releasing that energy in a single stroke to jump. But none of the jumping toys we had could compare to this tiny robot. Of all the things that I have ever tried to\n Because it's so small, it accelerates rapidly and travels a huge distance on each jump. Each takeoff happened faster than we could even register.\n Now, jumping might sound like a niche skill, but engineered jumpers would be perfect for exploring other worlds, particularly where the atmosphere is thin or non-existent. On the moon, with 1 sixth the gravity\n of Earth, this robot would be able to leap 125 meters high and half a kilometer forward. Rovers may struggle with steep cliffs and deep craters, but jumpers could hop in and out, fetching samples to bring back\n to the rover. And you don't lose much energy when jumping, so if you could store the kinetic energy back in the spring on landing, the efficiency could be near perfect. The team has already started to build an entire fleet of jumping robots.\n Some of them can right themselves after landing, so they can take off again right away. Others are steerable. They have three adjustable legs that allow the jumper to launch in any direction. Essentially what we've done is we've added three additional\n legs that don't store energy but rather allow it to form a tripod sort of that allows it to point a direction and launch in that direction. But how does this jumping mechanism work? Well the main structure consists of four pieces of carbon fiber\n bound together by elastic bands. Together, they create a spring that stores all the energy needed for the jump. At the top of the robot is a small motor. A string wrapped around the axle is connected to the bottom of the robot.\n When the motor is turned on, it winds up the string, compressing the robot. And this stores energy in the carbon fiber and rubber bands. After about a minute and a half, the structure reaches maximum compression.\n Basically once the bottom there sticks inward and it can stand up, right now it would roll over, then you can put it down. Got it. So as soon as you can. And at this point a trigger releases the latch that's holding the string on the axle.\n So all the string unspools all at once and the energy stored in the spring is released. The jumper goes from a standstill to over 100km an hour.\n in only 9 milliseconds. That gives an acceleration of over 300 Gs.\n That would be enough to kill basically any living creature. But how does it jump so much higher than everything else? Nearly ten times higher than the previous\n previous record holder. Well, this jumper has three special design features. First, the jumper is incredibly light at just 30 grams. It achieves this weight by employing a tiny motor and battery. Plus, its entire structure, made of\n lightweight carbon fiber and rubber doubles as the spring. Per unit mass, natural latex rubber can store more energy than nearly any other elastic material, 7,000 joules per kilogram.\n And the design of the spring makes it ideal for its purpose. Initially, they tried using only rubber bands connected to hinged aluminum rods. But with this design, when compressing it, the force rises to a peak\n and then decreases. Another design with only carbon fiber slats requires a lot of force to get started and then it increases linearly after that.\n The Ultimate Design is a hybrid of these two approaches, the benefit being its force profile is almost flat over the entire range of compression.\n Therefore, it provides double the energy storage of a typical spring, where force is proportional to displacement. The researchers argue this is the most efficient spring ever made. Sometimes a string will snap, it's not always the case.\n You'd probably expect that lighter would always be better with a jumper, especially if the\n Added weight is simply dead weight, rather than anything useful like a spring or a motor.\n to weigh at least as much as the foot. When your body's lighter, it's facing this collision, this energy transfer is very inefficient and you don't jump very high. But the real secret to how this jumper can achieve such heights is through something the researchers call work multiplication.\n Unlike an animal, which can only jump using a single stroke of its muscle, an engineered jumper can store up the energy from many strokes, or in this case many revolutions, of its motor. And that's how the motor can be so small. It doesn't have to deliver the energy\n all at once. It builds it up gradually over a few minutes. And this is possible because there is a latch under tension, preventing the spring from unspooling until the robot is\n fully compressed. Interestingly, biological organisms do use latches. For example, the sand flea, which can jump incredibly high for its body size.\n here is right inside of the pivot point. So as it contracts that muscle the leg doesn't extend, right? It's actually closing it more. But then it has a second muscle that pulls it out. It's going to shift this muscle\n ever so slightly outside the pivot point. That's wild. So there's these two muscles that are working. So here's your big power muscle, here's your trigger muscle, it's a torque reversal mechanism, and then all of a sudden it shoots. But even though the bioluminescence\n world has latches, no organism has developed work multiplication for a jump from standstill, at least not internally. Spider monkeys have been observed pulling back a branch hand over hand using multiple muscle strokes and\n stored in the bend of the branch to catapult themselves forward. There's a spider that shoots out a silky string, which they pull back multiple times in order to slingshot themselves to another location. So it's like slingshotting itself?\n They're called the slingshot spider. Now I tried jumping in moon boots to see if they would help me go higher. Okay.\n And it certainly felt like they did, but Elliot pointed out that from a standing start, they don't actually help much. Only if you jump a few times before can you store up some of the previous\n jumps energy in the elastic bands, and then that energy helps launch you higher on the following jump. For years, engineered jumping was developed to mimic biological jumping, but with work multiplication, it\n gained an advantage. If you can generate a large burst of energy simply by running a motor for a long time, the power of the motor is no longer the limiting factor, the spring is, so you can focus on making the most powerful spring possible.\n This jumper has nearly maximized the achievable height with this spring. Assuming an infinitely light motor with infinite time to wind up, the highest possible jump with this compression spring is only around 19% higher than what they've achieved.\n If you want to incorporate air resistance and play with aerodynamics, another way to send the jumper higher is to make it 10 times isometrically larger, leading to a 15-20% higher jump.\n the flea. If we went 10 times bigger we could actually avoid air drag completely. This works since if the jumper is scaled up 10 times on all sides the cross-sectional area increases by a hundred which increases the drag force but the\n The jumper's mass increases by a thousand, so it has way more inertia, meaning the drag force affects it less. The entire concept of work multiplication could bring robots to the next level.\n Currently, motors and robots have to be relatively small so they remain portable. But the simple principle of building up the energy from multiple turns of a motor over time would allow robots to store and then release huge amounts of energy and set some world\n records in the process. Getting this robot off the ground required more than just engineering.

            "transcription": "This is a video about how Japanese swords are made. Swords that are strong enough and sharp enough to slice a bullet in half. The access we got for this video is incredible. We were able to film everything from gathering the\n iron sand, to smelting the iron, forging the sword, to sharpening and polishing it. They even let us use it. The method of making these\n swords has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years, with everything done by hand. They are still considered to be among the best in the world.\n These swords are held in such high regard that one from the 16th century has been appraised at 105 million dollars, making it the most expensive\n of sword ever built. In the Shimane province of Japan, there is a smelter that is lit for only one night\n each year, where steel is made in the same way it was 1300 years ago. It's known as the Tatara method and only steel made in this way ends up in the very best Japanese swords.\n And we were invited to come film it. Just after 9am, the ceremonial prayers are said and the fire is lit by a Shinto priest.\n Everyone that will be working the smelter will be here for at least the next 24 hours. That includes Veritasium producer Peter. I'm committed. We're gonna do this. It's gonna be fun.\n Japan goes back about 3000 years, but in those days swords were made out of bronze. We're not sure how people first learned to smelt metal, but it was likely related to pottery.\n bronze was discovered before steel,\n because it's an alloy of copper and usually tin, both metals with low enough melting points that they can be smelted in regular pottery kilns. The problem with bronze is that although it can be sharpened, it's too soft to hold an edge for long.\n So, Japanese sword makers shifted to steel 1200 years ago in the Heian period. This is what most people would recognize as a Japanese sword. It's made of steel with a curved blade.\n Steel is an alloy of iron, the fourth most common element in Earth's crust. The oceans of the world used to be rich with dissolved iron. But two and a half billion years ago, cyanobacteria started\n photosynthesizing and creating oxygen. The iron reacted with that oxygen, precipitating out of solution to be deposited at the bottom of the ocean. Incidentally, the cyanobacteria were poisoned by the oxygen that they themselves\n produced, so it's thought that when levels got high enough they died off, and as a result oxygen levels dropped and iron no longer precipitated out of solution. Then the cyanobacteria could multiply again and the cycle repeated.\n That's why most of the world's iron is found in layers of sedimentary rock called banded iron formations. Each layer of iron was formed during a global flourishing of cyanobacteria that infused the ocean.\n with oxygen. The majority of the global iron supply comes from these banded iron formations because of their high concentration of iron, up to around 60% iron oxide by weight.\n But Japan, with its mostly volcanic geology, has barely any of these sedimentary iron oxides. And this is likely why the country was late to the steel production game. Archaeologists have found steel artifacts in Anatolia,\n which is modern-day Turkey, that are nearly 4,000 years old. But in Japan, metals, including steel, were imported from China and Korea up until the 8th century, when Japan started making its own steel.\n Where did they get the raw ingredients? Well, igneous rocks like granite and diorite still contain iron oxides, just in much lower concentrations. But as the mountains are weathered, these iron\n The Japanese noticed that because iron oxides are denser than other minerals in the sand, they accumulate in places where the river changes color.\n changes direction or speed. The heavier iron sinks to the bottom and the lighter material is washed away. To amplify this effect, they deliberately created diversions in the river to increase the concentration\n of iron.\n you can get iron sands with 80% iron oxides by weight. That's more concentrated than high quality iron ore. And since it has fewer impurities, it's an excellent source material for high quality steel.\n If you heat up those iron oxides to over 1250 degrees celsius, you can break the bonds with oxygen and get pure iron. But pure iron is actually softer than bronze, so in its elemental state iron provides no effect.\n advantage. But nature gave humans a lucky break. One of the few ways you can heat something up to 1250 degrees is with charcoal. And charcoal is basically pure carbon. And if you add just a\n little bit of carbon to iron, it creates an incredibly strong alloy, steel. A lot of people see it as a heat process. I see it as a chemical process. Alloys are usually stronger than pure metals,\n because they contain different sized atoms. And this reduces the ability of atoms to slide past each other when an external force is applied. So I've just been given gloves.\n other gloves and a towel so things are very much getting real. I'm genuinely quite worried. Here is the room with all of the charcoal that we're going to be using overnight. There's\n There's just bags and bags of this stuff.\n There's a Buddha saying, before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. I'm here? Okay.\n So we're lining up on the four corners I guess. Oh boy, didn't do a great job of that.\n So the rain is coming, so we're quickly getting all the charcoal out and then measuring it. So each bag of these is 10 kilos. Okay. So with the iron sand,\n It is mixed together with water because if you don't mix it with water and you put it on the plant it just flies straight up. But if you mix it with too much water then there is water that's gonna heat up, it's gonna become water vapor and the whole kiln could explode.\n Terrifyingly enough, they do this by feel. They mix in enough water until the iron sand is clumpy, but again, if it's too much, the whole thing could explode.\n Okay, put some iron in.\n It is just past four in the afternoon and over the last couple of hours we have added 250 kilograms of charcoal and nearly 60 kilograms of iron sand. So yeah, it's a slow process, but I think we're starting to get somewhere.\n No idea because obviously the thing is hidden. But it should be growing. To achieve the high temperatures required to make steel, you need a strong, steady supply of oxygen.\n For hundreds of years, this was provided by huge foot-operated bellows. It would have taken an around-the-clock, full-body effort by many men to maintain the furnace's temperature.\n The temperature inside the smelter gets up to\n 1500 degrees celsius, just below the melting point of iron, which is 1538 celsius. So the iron being smelted isn't liquid, but it's soft and malleable enough to clump together into a big block of iron.\n No matter how high quality the iron sand is, there will always be some impurities, like sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon oxides. They combine with carbon from the charcoal and melt at a lower temperature than iron, so they become liquid.\n and flow to the bottom. This is known as slag. After many more hours of adding charcoal and iron sand, it is time for the first removal of the slag. Before the first removal of slag,\n another prayer is said.\n\u304a!\n So for the last three hours there's been three processes that we've been doing. One is adding the charcoal, two is adding the iron sand and three is opening up the smelter from the\n bottom to break apart the impurities so they can flow out.\n Just want you guys to know that it's 316 in the morning and I'm still here and I'm really\n sleepy. So it's currently six o'clock in the morning. The next day we've been smelting for 21 hours. I'm exhausted but the sun is about to come out and it's been pretty\n amazing I gotta be honest we gotta close these doors really quick before they get mad at me. At 9 a.m. the next morning the smelting is complete. A total of 614 kilograms of iron sand and 670 kilograms of\n charcoal were added to the smelter. At this point in a traditional smelter the only way to get the steel out would be to break it apart. These days a crane is used to take the smelter\n And what is left to show for all that hard work is a 100 kilogram block of steel, iron and slag, only around a third\n of this block is high enough quality to be used in sword making. Oh, that's insane. That's so cool. The result for all the hard work.\n This is step one of making a Japanese sword. The steel is sorted by quality and carbon content, which is also done by eye. In fact, this is one of the exams you need to pass to be certified as a swordsmith.\n Then, the different grades of steel are sent out to one of 300 swordsmiths around the country. Only 30 do it as their full-time job. One of them is Akihira Kokaji, who we went to visit next.\n This is when the forging of the sword begins. In a coal oven with hand-pumped bellows, the steel is heated until it is soft and malleable. Then, using hammers, the master swordsmith flattens out the steel.\n In the old days, this would have been done by the swordsmith and three apprentices. The swordsmith using a smaller hammer would set the rhythm, and the apprentices would use big mallets to flatten the steel.\n Woo, that was terrifying. These days, electric hammers are used.\n When the steel is flat enough, it is then bent back on itself.\n And it is then hammered again to press the steel back together into a solid block. So why go to all this effort, flattening the steel only to\n to fold it back on itself and end up with a chunk of steel the same size as before. Because folding does two very important things. First, it spreads out the impurities like silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus.\n them out throughout the steel. This ensures a uniform consistency without any weak points. Second, it gives the steel a grain. After folding the sword, it is now reinforced in the direction that it will be hit in combat.\n And as a bonus, the steel is exposed to the air, so there is a small amount of oxidation, creating a darker colored steel, which when folded makes beautiful patterns. There are some swords which have more than\n than a billion layers. This doesn't mean the sword has been folded a billion times, since every fold doubles the number of layers. But usually, a sword is folded\n 10 to 13 times, resulting in a few thousand layers of steel. Now a blade isn't made from a single block of steel. The carbon content affects how hard the steel is, so different carbon percentages are used in different\n parts of the blade. Because carbon atoms are much smaller than iron atoms, they can fit inside the crystal lattice of iron. These trapped carbon atoms then apply an outward force to the lattice, putting the steel under stress.\n The higher the carbon percentage, the harder and more rigid the steel. But this hardness comes at a cost. The steel becomes brittle, making it more likely to chip and shatter, rather than bend.\n swordsmiths do is they use steel with different carbon contents for different parts of the blade. The edge is always high carbon steel to make it hard and rigid so it can maintain a sharp edge for a long time, but the spine is usually made of lower\n carbon steel, which allows the sword to flex without breaking. This is done by welding together pieces of steel with different carbon contents.\n After the sword is hammered\n When it is covered into shape, which is a straight blade, it is covered in a layer of clay, a thick layer for the spine and a thin layer for the blade itself. It's then heated in the furnace and then rapidly cooled in water, a process\n This is known as quenching. Because the layers of clay have different thicknesses, the rate of cooling is faster for the edge than the spine. When the steel is heated, carbon enters the iron lattice, and since the\n If the spine of the sword is covered in thick clay, it will cool slowly, giving time for the carbon atoms to leave the iron matrix. This will lead to a very low carbon steel called ferrite, but the carbon atoms which have left the matrix will be caught by other iron\n atoms and create a type of steel known as cementite. The combination of ferrite and cementite is known as perlite, and it's a mostly soft and ductile form of steel, though parts of it are hard due to the cementite. So, perlite\n forms the spine of the sword. In contrast, the very thin layer of clay on the blade means that it cools very rapidly, so more of the carbon is trapped in the lattice. This forces the lattice structure to change from cubic to tetragonic.\n making a form of steel known as martensite. Since the trapped carbon puts stress on the lattice, martensite is incredibly hard, exactly what you'd want for the edge of a sword.\n The tetragonal lattice structure of martensite also takes up more space, so the edge of the blade expands relative to the spine, curving the sword backwards. The iconic curve of a samurai sword comes from the formation of martensite.\n You can actually see the boundary between different types of steel in a finished sword by the difference in color. This is known as Hamon, which literally means edge pattern.\n Albert Museum in London, there is a Japanese sword that has a very detailed little dragon in the hormone and I've looked at it many times and I don't okay I don't know how he did that. About one-third of all blades shatter during the quenching process.\n process. The sword is then placed back in the forage to evaporate any remaining water. This also provides a little bit of energy to loosen some of the crystal structures\n making the sword less brittle. After the sword is forged,\n One of the things that\n I love is that like this table is sloping down and the entire floor over there is sloping down so when you like add the water all of the residue and all the water you know flows downhill so it's not perfectly flat.\n Sometimes the swords are also engraved with beautiful patterns, though this is quite rare. And after all that, the sword is done. To learn how to use it,\n use a Japanese sword, Peter got a lesson from a master, Takara Takanashi. He is the 10th generation student of Miyamoto Musashi, a legendary samurai. Musashi killed his first opponent\n in single combat at the age of 13. He spent the rest of his life perfecting his sword fighting, inventing a new technique with two swords. Musashi fought in more than 60 duels to the death, and he won every last\n one of them. There is a story about a duel that took place during a snowstorm. As he faced his opponent, Katana outstretched. Musashi was so calm and kept his sword so still that snowflakes\n began to accumulate on the thin edge of the blade. So during the lesson I thought I would get to use a katana but instead we spent the entire time learning how to take the blade out of its sheath and\n and then put it back in. So when I actually got the chance to use a katana to slice through some things, I was deeply unprepared.\n Okay, so this has been an amazing day we've looked at some beautiful katanas and now these wonderful people\n are letting me use one of their just unbelievably beautiful pieces of art to chop some things.\n There really is something remarkable about Japanese swords. The amount of care, attention, and expertise that each\n step requires. From the gathering and refining of the iron sand, to the smelting, to the forging and sharpening a sword, each step takes so much time and skill. It's incredible that all these things were discovered by trial and error to produce\n artifacts of such high quality that they are still prized centuries later. Before I made this video, I didn't really appreciate that swords can be art.\n To me, it's a good reminder that whatever you do, you should do it with deep care, attention to detail, and love for the craft. Do that enough times, and you might just make something beautiful.\n Hey, this part of the video was brought to you by Henson Shaving. You know, making high quality things is hard, and as far as I'm concerned, Henson make the highest quality\n razors in the world, the katanas of the shaving world if you will. I've been using their AL13 razor for the last year and it's the best razor I've used by a long margin. One of the reasons for that is Henson really understands the physics of shaving.\n because as aerospace machinists for 20 years, they understand how to cut things effectively. They get precision. Human hair is much harder than the skin it's growing out of, and as a result, typical razors drag and pull on the hair while cutting.\n Razor does is it assumes that the first cut will be ineffective and so they build in extra blades to cut the hair before it can snap back into position and that does result in a good cut but it also increases friction leading to razor burn and skin irritation.\n Henson carefully studied that problem and realized that you didn't need to add extra blades, you just needed to properly support a single blade. Virtually every razor on allows for too much play in the blade, but Henson doesn't. The result is an effective\n effective cut without the additional friction on your skin. Seriously, a Henson is truly a great razor. It'll last you a lifetime. You'll get a better shave with less irritation and you'll also save money in the long run.

            "transcription": "This metal is about as close to magic as it is possible to find in nature. It can adjust its arrangement of atoms to return to some predefined shape, but it also converts between mechanical and\n thermal energy, and it can stretch up to 30 times more than an ordinary metal and still spring back to its original size. Because of these unique properties, it's being used in everything from medical\n devices to toys to bulletproof bike tires. And it's allowing NASA to reinvent the wheel for space exploration. This is the bones of the the bones of the tire. The bones of the\n tire is a slinky. So basically this is the slinky applied to the rim. You just wrapped a slinky around a rim. Yeah it doesn't get any simpler than that right. Here is a bicycle that has slinkies inside a polymer. If you look\n This tire does not require air pressure to work. The structure and shock absorption are all provided by that metal slinky. Which means you should be able to puncture it\n with no loss of performance, so we're gonna drive it over a bed of nails. But first, we'll test a traditional pneumatic tire, just to make sure these nails are sharp.\n Another puncture, another flat tire. This one kind of expected. So now I'm going to put these airless tires to the test at driving over the same bed of nails\n Here we go. I heard a lot of pops. I must have hit some nails. I don't feel anything different.\n Still rides well. I'm gonna get up some speed. That's definitely a nail. I think the nail broke.\n Why does it look like that's what it looks like? Yeah, the nails in the tire. We're now going to try to shoot a bullet into the tire and see what happens. Three, two, one.\n There it is. There it is. Look at that! Wow. It's just a really clean shot straight through. Yep. Barely even see the mark on the tire. Looks like\n This one actually hit the alloy. Yep, it does to me. Yeah, that's what it feels like. You can see we spliced off some of the bullet before we even got to the cardboard. How's it ride? Yeah, no problems. Bulletproof bicycle.\n This bulletproof bike tire actually comes out of NASA's research into making wheels for space missions. It is really hard to make good wheels for other planets. I mean, a lot of the places we want to send rovers to, there is no\n or very low atmospheric pressure. Besides, with temperatures dropping to extreme lows, rubber becomes brittle.\n a flagpole. The temperature facing the Sun would be 250 degrees Fahrenheit above zero. In the shadow is 250 degrees below zero. Let's put some rubber on the moon. Negative 90 is the glass transition temperature is\n It's when the polymer goes from being flexible to a rigid element. This is what happens when you dip rubber in liquid nitrogen.\n That's why you can't send rubber to the moon. This is why almost all the wheels used for exploring other planets have been made of hard metal. This is actually a spare for the Curiosity rover. It's made out of aluminum, a single billet that gets machined down so you don't have to worry\n But with it being so expensive to launch matter into space, the wheels have to be as lightweight as possible.\n They made this skin 0.7 millimeters thick. These structural members here, which we also call grousers, they're there to give the wheel strength, but also help grab onto obstacles and help grab the soil. The problem is that because this rubber is so large,\n and heavy and the terrain is just so aggressive and nasty, they're actually seeing much higher peak loads kind of focused on areas between these grousers than what was predicted and this is the actual condition of the wheels on Mars right now and as you can see\n When you apply a force to a material, that is\n known as a stress. And what you're really doing is tugging on all the atoms inside the object. And as a result, their spacing changes a little bit, and so the material deforms. For example, if you pull on an object, it will get slightly longer.\n And the per unit change in length is called strain. Now for most materials under low stresses, strain is directly proportional to the stress applied. The more you stress it, the more it stretches. And the material is elastic.\n If you remove the stress, the object goes back to its original size. So no atoms have moved around and no bonds have been broken or formed. You've just made them flex when you apply that stress. But if the stress applied exceeds the yield strength of the material,\n Well then the strain is so great that the atoms can't maintain their positions relative to each other. Defects called edge dislocations can move through the material. The atoms are actually rearranging themselves and so the deformation is not reversible.\n It's plastic deformation. So the object won't go back to its original shape when the stress is removed. If enough stress is applied, the material can completely fracture. In the worst case scenario, this results in holes like in the\n Mars Rover wheels, which reduced their performance and ultimately could jeopardize the mission. Ordinary metals can withstand a strain of only around 0.3 to 0.8% elastically. Any more than that and they undergo plastic deformation, so\n they won't return to their original shape. Ultimately, they could even fracture. That's why every component of a space vehicle is designed\n designed never to stretch more than that 0.3 to 0.8 percent, but that's a significant limitation. There is a different type of wheel that NASA has tried in space, which are those on the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle,\n LRV.\n ensure that the tire does not sink into the ground. So they did some studies with these tread strips to figure out how much coverage they needed. And so they found out that roughly 50% was enough to keep the tire kind of floating on the surface and still maintain that flexibility.\n The lunar roving vehicle wheels worked well for the short distance journeys traveled on the moon. The farthest this vehicle ever went was 36 kilometers. But still, these wheels needed to be designed to minimize plastic deformation of the steel mesh.\n internal structure inside there we call it a bump stop. So as they hit a bump and this is deformed when it hits that it stops the deformation to keep it just below that proportional limit where they would induce plasticity.\n This wheel was good enough for the short Apollo missions, but for longer journeys, a bump stop won't be enough to prevent plastic deformation building up over time. Mesh steel wheels have been tried on Earth, but their performance does degrade.\n This was the Morris steel spring tire we made and drove on that same test rig. There's no fracture, but you see a lot of permanent deformation there. What we need is a material that is strong and durable like steel, but which can endure a much more strong\n without deforming permanently. And that is where this stuff comes in. In 1961, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory was doing experiments with different alloys involving nickel and titanium. A sample\n The sample that had been repeatedly worked, heated, and cooled was shown to one of the associate technical directors, who just happened to be a pipe smoker. So he decided to see what the sample would do if he applied a bit of heat from his lighter.\n that, he found that the material changed shape. This shocked everyone and led to more investigations into the material, which became known as nitinol for its components, nickel and titanium, and for the naval ordnance laboratory,\n where it was discovered. So why did nitinol change shape? It's really because the alloy can undergo a phase change in the solid state. In heated nitinol, the atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice arrangement,\n and this phase is known as austenite. But upon cooling, the atoms ease into a form known as twinned martensite. It's a messier, lower symmetry arrangement of the atoms. And in this phase, you can apply stress to the material\n material and deform it. But unlike in an ordinary metal, this deformation is not causing bonds between atoms to break and edge dislocations moving throughout the material. Now in this case, the crystal structure is changing once again to a\n de-twin-ed form of martensite. And now when you heat it back up, the material goes from martensite back to being austenite. Which means all the atoms go back to their original locations, and so the material returns to its original shape.\n basically set this shape as the parent known memory shape. That's why we call it shape memory. I can stretch this out. If I cooled it down I could stretch it out even more but as soon as I heat\n it back up, it'll remember that original parent shape. And that's why nitinol is considered a shape memory alloy. The shape is set at high temperature when the material is in the austenite phase.\n Then, as the material is cooled down, it undergoes a phase transition into twinned martensite. If stress is now applied to the material in this phase, it can be extensively deformed by changing the crystal structure into detwinned\n martensite. When the stress is released, most of that deformation remains. But when the sample is heated, the atoms return to the austenite phase, which returns the material to its original shape.\n It's like you're barely in the water. No, it's as fast as you can conduct heat to it or get heat away from it. Whoa, I mean that's cool. This is the property of\n of night and all that most people are aware of and one that makes it useful for a lot of applications. So that's a stint. They slightly cool these down right below to martin site and then they crush it or elongate it so you can see it gets real thin.\n And then they put in a catheter and that catheter goes through the body to the place where they want to deploy the stent. And then upon deploying it, it bounces right back, increasing that outer diameter and opening that artery. Nite-Nall is absolutely perfect for that.\n Alloys can actually generate significant forces when they're heated, which means they can also be used as actuators. You're going to see a huge amount of force and stress build up in the wire, which we can see with here with how much it's pulling.\n Six pounds, seven, you can really see it contracting there. 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 pounds. Oh, it's lifting!\n That's about 90 newtons of force. Scientists have even used shape memory alloys to fracture a rock. Shape memory alloys are being investigated for use in aviation.\n I made a video before about vortex generators, which are these little fins that stick up out of the wing of a plane to trip the airflow into turbulence. This is important for takeoff and landing to keep the flow attached to the wing so you don't stall. But when you're up at cruise,\n and you don't need those vortices being generated, you want these to stow because they're drag-cunnally. As the plane just climbs from takeoff to cruise, we go from some temperature on the ground to\n something close to minus 50 minus 60 C at cruise. The alloy is designed in between those so that we can just take advantage of the ambient temperature change that happens in the environment. When we cool this one down, no controller\n The temperature at which the material transitions between austenite and martensite can be tuned to be anywhere between minus 150 to positive 350 degrees\n Celsius. This is done by changing the ratio of the elements and using different heat treatments.\n This principle has been extended to operate the main flaps on an aircraft. Now the heating and cooling is not passive, but controlled by a heating element.\n you have a 737 aircraft and no hydraulic actuators on the wing box. All we have is a shuttle mechanism that's driven by two tubes of nitinol and we've driven those ailerons and flap elements on the wing box of a 737 in flight.\n 60 degrees flap angle down, 30 degrees flap angle up, just by heating and cooling two tubes of nitinol. Replaces all the hydraulics. The shape memory effect is the main thing people know about materials like nitinol, but they have another unique property, which\n makes them ideal for making durable wheels.\n Really weird. That's 6-8% strain which you can't do in other wires, right? But what's weird about it is that it feels a little crunchy. It feels, because you're feeling all of the reorientations. Ugh, so weird. So cool though, right?\n Yes, very cool. Can you hear that? How weird is that? That pinging is 20. Shape memory alloys can stretch up to 8%\n of their length and still spring back to their original size. This property is known as superelasticity or pseudoelasticity, but they're kind of misnomers because the material is not actually operating in its elastic regime. What's actually\n happening is that this nitinol is in the austenite phase. Its transition temperature is lower than room temperature. But by applying a stress, even with no temperature change, you can force the crystal structure to change from austenite into\n detwinned martensite. This rearrangement allows the nitinol to deform by that 8%. Still, it'll snap back to its original configuration once the stress is removed and the atoms return to the austenite phase.\n That sound you're hearing is the material undergoing a stress-induced phase change in the solid state. If you want to think about it on a stress-strain curve, now this transformation is occurring entirely above the\n martensite transition temperature. So the material starts off in the austenite phase. And then the applied stress is what induces the phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite. And when that stress is removed, the atoms spring back to the\n night phase and so the material goes back to its original size and shape. If this were a normal tube I would bend it to here and it would plasticize. If it was a brass tube which you know has a plastic buckling mode it would go like this and it would actually buckle the wall.\n I would never take my hands and bend them like this and have it completely return to shape. At the bend, the nightinol is transforming from austenite to martensite and back. When we go from the higher symmetry phase,\n the austenite to the lower symmetry daughter phase. Which one is it? Exothermic or endothermic? I feel like that should be exothermic. Good job, science guy. If you were to put your hand around this tube,\n you'll actually feel the heat energy, the enthalpy of that transformation evolving as heat. You ready? Yep. Oh yeah, that's real hot. Oh, that actually\n It is like burning. Like I can't keep my hand on it. No, keep your hand on it. It won't burn. When the stress is removed and the material goes back to being austenite, that phase change is endothermic. It absorbs heat. Right?\n It's like you could use that for a refrigerator. So the- it's exactly right. So another area where these materials are being applied is in a field called elastocalorics where we use this transformation to do things equivalent to\n heat pumping. I want to shoot this with our thermal camera, you got a FLIR with us. How's that? This dissipation potential can act a little bit like the dissipation in the shock absorber, right? So the tire itself could actually\n perform some of that dissipation potential on its own. It almost acts as a damper to get rid of that energy loss so then your tire actually has the potential of becoming a complete suspension system which obviously\n Really simplifies building vehicles for for space. The original tire. When I put load on it. Okay, you can see I'm only transferring a load from the footprint to this little section of the tire. Right.\n By tying this bump stop element to here, when I go through a footprint, you can see now I'm transferring load 360 degrees around the tire. By doing that,\n I have now increased my load carrying capacity significantly without adding any more mass. So to make a tire out of shape memory alloy, they weave night and all springs together into a mesh. It's a\n tedious and time-consuming process.\n Are you kidding me? Is this what you do every day? 684 times. 684 times per tire. But will these wheels work on rovers on the moon and Mars?\n Well, they test the wheels extensively on a rotating carousel of different terrain types, from sand to small rocks to bigger rocks. So the terrain endurance rig basically consists of a circular carousel\n that is independently driven. The wheel tire assembly is also independently driven so we can create a forced slip condition so we can drive with zero slip.\n And this is about how slow a Mars rover would be traveling. Average speed is about 6.7 centimeters per second. That's a nominal speed. They don't go too fast.\n Alright, I'm gonna go walk on simulated moon Regula. It looks like beach, and it feels like beach. This side is meant to simulate the surface of the moon, and this side is meant to be the surface of Mars.\n It is very sinky sand. Wheel is rolling along, rolling along, hits a rock. And I'm just, am I pushing into it or do I want to get it on top? I'd say get on top and just put all your body weight onto it.\n That's basically my full weight on it. The shape memory alloy is strong enough to support the weight of a vehicle or vehicle and crew, but it's also incredibly flexible so it can deform up to 8% without being permanently damaged and that's what's needed\n for long space missions.\n But these tires won't just be for space, they're also looking at terrestrial applications.\n They have to be pressurized to really, really high pressurizations, 300, 400 PSI, not the conventional 30 to 60 PSI you do in a car or truck tire, right? We have issues where at those huge pressurizations,\n they can explode. The other construct is maintenance, right? So if I'm a pneumatic tire and I'm relying on that pneumatics for the performance of the system, I have to always be checking the air pressure to make sure that I'm\n at the right inflation pressure so that I'm not burning too much fuel or I'm not at a place where I could potentially pop a tire because of the loads. By going to a structural system that doesn't rely on air and is designed specifically for the application\n They've tested one on a Jeep. Since it doesn't rely on pressurized air for support, you just can't get a flat tire. Plus, it can never be under-inflated, which significantly improves fuel economy.\n economy. With a metal that works like magic, you can make airless tires that will take us off-road, on-road, into the air, and across other worlds.\n NASA's Night and All tires are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission, even on the rough terrain of Mars. But here on Earth, few products last\n a lifetime. From bike tires to phones to toothbrushes, pretty much everything wears out. But with Henson Shaving, the sponsor of this video, you may never need to buy another razor again in your life. Henson actually came out of an aerospace machine shop that built parts for\n the Mars Rover and the ISS, so they are experts in precise high-quality work. If the temperature to manufacture their rover parts changed as little as one degree, they had to scrap the entire piece, and that sort of precision is overlooked by most Razor manufacturers.\n In a typical razor, the blades flex and bend when they make contact with the skin, and this movement causes micro cuts leading to skin irritation and razor bumps. To many people, this is just an inevitable part of shaving, but it doesn't need to be.\n This is Henson's AL-13 razor. It's so precise that the blade extends past the shave plane by exactly .0013 inches. That's less than the width of a human hair.\n The blade is also securely fastened at exactly 30 degrees, leaving almost zero blade flex for a smoother and cleaner shave. This razor is designed to last a lifetime, and its standard double-edged blades cost only around 10 cents each, which means the cost of ownership, for\n an AL-13 razor ends up lower than most cartridge or electric razors after only two years. And besides price considerations, having one razor for the rest of your life is both more convenient and better for the planet. So if you want one aerospace quality razor to last the rest of\n your life, go to hensonshaving.com slash Veritasium and enter code Veritasium for a hundred free blades with the purchase of a razor. That's two to four years worth of blades on me. Make sure to add both the razor and the blades to your cart for the code to take effect. So I want to\n I want to thank Henson Shaving for sponsoring this video and I want to thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union had to build underground silos to house nuclear missiles that could be launched at a few minutes notice. Now one of the technical challenges they had to overcome that you might not think of is a\n Acoustics, launching a missile in such confined silo generates a loud sound, so loud that it would have shaken apart the missiles before they could even launch. So the walls of the inside of the silo had to be covered in acoustically\n absorbent tiles very similar to those in the world's quietest room. But after all of the technical challenges were sorted, what I wanted to know was how could they have launched these missiles very quickly if needed, but also\n never by accident. So I visited one of these Titan missile silos in the Arizona desert to find out exactly what it would have taken to launch a nuclear missile.\n We're down some 10 meters below the surface now. And this is the launch duct. And that is the launch duct.\n Titan II, the largest and most powerful missile weapon system ever deployed by the United States. And what kind of bomb is in there? That is a thermonuclear bomb. It's a nine megaton weapon. Compared to Hiroshima?\n Oh, call it 650 times. An enormously powerful weapon. And what was the idea with it? The idea behind Titan 2 was to instill enough fear in the mind of the enemy\n to cause them to think twice about launching an attack against us, knowing that 10 meters below the desert in our fortified concrete bunker, we can ride out their first strike and live to retaliate. And if we're forced to do that, the consequences\n This missile is no longer active, but the launch system is preserved, and I wanted an\n insight into how it felt to control this incredible power. Can we go launch one? I thought you'd never ask. There were 54 of these silos\n Each one staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Ready to launch their missiles on the exclusive order of the President of the United States. All right then. Have a seat here, Commander. Thank you.\n So this is control center, this is where the crew waited to launch the missile. And how do we know that we need to launch? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n So we're going to write down every letter and number that we hear in a form in this notebook. I'm going to write it down in this notebook. We'll compare each other's work if we agree that we've copied the message correctly. Then we have what's called a valid message and authorization to take our lock off the Big Red Cell.\n You know your combination, I know mine, we don't know each other. So we both have to agree to get inside. Inside we find authenticator cards. I'll give those to you. In the secret message they sent us a seven character code word. We're gonna look at the first two letters of the code word, we're gonna find the authenticator.\n that has those first two letters. If the card here matches the code word they sent us, then this is a legitimate order to go. That gives us permission to put in our launch keys. I've already put them in for us. Key right here for you, Commander. And for me, there's a key way over here.\n Keys are far enough apart that not even a long-armed guy like me can reach them both. Keys must be turned within two seconds of each other and held or spring-loaded, so held for five seconds to start the watch. That guarantees that two people will be required to do it. You just can't run back and forth.\n and do what you say. And last but not least, we get the secret unlock code for the missile. Six little wheels. Each little wheel has 16 letters of the alphabet. Nominally 17 million combinations. Only one.\n All set? Let's do it.\n We'll send this thing on its way. After you, Commander. Three, two, one, turn keys. And hold. Okay, you may release. That's all there is to it. The green light turns on.\n says launch enable. For all intents and purposes, that should say welcome to World War III, because that's pretty much what it boils down to. When you turn the key, you are committed. There is no oops switch anywhere. When the batteries come to full power,\n the missile will transfer to internal power, meaning that it is fully independent. About that same time, the silo door starts to slide open. It'll slide through a security radar beam and set off.\n That gives us solid soft. Guidance go means the internal guidance computer has full control of the mission. In a few seconds we'll have main engine start. From engine start we'll build up thrust, pop the hull down\n and off we go in the wild we know.\n So that's it. We've basically just ended life on Earth. As you know it.\n In these silos the Titan missiles had a terrifying purpose, but they were also put to much better uses, minus their warhead of course. For example the Voyager spacecraft\n was launched into space atop a Titan III missile. And Neil Armstrong took his first flight into space atop a Titan II, the exact same missile that would have delivered nuclear warheads to the Soviet Union. So the Cold War didn't only bring us\n this fear and potential of mutually assured destruction, it also made space exploration possible. Now I want to say thank you to everyone for writing in to request this documentary be played in your area. Thanks to you\n We've managed to get it broadcast in Norway Sweden and the Middle East and details are in the description So check it out for everyone else these the documentary will be available online via our broadcasters though There may be some geo blocking restrictions\n But I'm pretty confident that anyone who wants to see the documentary will be able to via those means.

            "transcription": "From the top of this 45 meter drop tower, my friends from the How Ridiculous YouTube channel are about to release a watermelon. Here we go. In free fall for a full three\n seconds the watermelon accelerates to over a hundred kilometers per hour before smashing into the ground the results are predictable but this was\n just a control for the actual experiment. Another watermelon was sprayed with a polymer coating. We'll come back to what this is and how it works, but for now let's see how the coated watermelon fares in the drop test.\n Instead of shattering the watermelon bounces\n and remains intact for the most part anyway. Is it broken inside? Yeah it is. It's definitely slushy. Even with an axe the How Ridiculous Boys\n can't crack this shell.\n It's actually watermelon. That is amazing.\n Amazing that the watermelon could survive an impact at over a hundred kilometers per hour So I went to find out more about the coating called linex. It's a mess The individual components are a mess when it goes on it goes on as a big mess. You saw me wear a spray suit. It's\n It's the best. But when you're done, you're really cool stuff. Linux is made from two ingredients. A and B. Inside of each of these is multiple things. But the main component of A is diphenylmethane 4,4-diisocyanate.\n or MDI for short. It's very reactive due to these groups on the end. B is the poly, so the simplest way I could explain is it's a plasticizer. The main component of B is alpha 2-aminomethyl ethyl, omega 2-aminomethyl ethyl,\n ethoxypolyoxymethyl-1,2-ethanediol. Long name for a long chain molecule. In reality, it would be many times longer than this. Now I managed to convince Bryn to let me mix the two ingredients the old-fashioned way with the stirred\n steak. That's the A. Wow. I'm gonna dump A and B in here and you just mix them and see what happens. All right. Okay. Ready? Yep. All right. Go for it.\n How quickly should they react? They're reacting right now. Did you see that? That is crazy. And you can see there's almost like, I don't know, smoke or something. Well, it's probably getting quite warm.\n I guess I could have got the thermometer out for you. Whoa. Feel the bottom, tell me. You tell me. Yeah, that's very hot. It's like the bottom of a hot rib. Oh, very hot. Very hot. Yeah. What's happening here is the molecules of A and B are reacting\n to form long chains. Where they join, they form a urea group, so the substance is called a polyurea. The structure of these chains is responsible for the properties of the coating. So it's hard because it's made of a tangled mess of molecular threads, but flexible\n because these threads can be stretched out and then snap back into place. Things you learn doing the reaction this way are that it's rapid, only taking seconds to react, and it's exothermic. A lot of heat is given off as these bonds form. But this bond\n All of linex isn't really useful for much, so how do you mix A and B to form an effective coating?\n that essentially mixes them and then they come out the end of the gun. So from the time they're separate components, they mix out the gun, hit your target fraction of a second. This is where the magic happens.\n Inside here, so you pull the trigger, out comes Line-X. We decided to Line-X a piece of paper to see how strong the coating is.\n As you can see it came out as a hot high pressure liquid. Okay now it's quite warm and because that's an exothermic reaction it comes out at 150 but it keeps getting\n getting hotter and hotter. You can probably rip it right now. I can rip it? Yeah, I think so. There you go. Okay. Alright. Those two chemicals just keep kind of looking for each other or looking for something, so to speak, until until every last molecule is found at home.\n or giving up looking and that could take a day or more but there's plenty of opportunities to cross-link right now so that's what it's doing and that's where all the heat's coming from so it's already dry I'm not gonna get any on me it's already cooling back down so we've done\n the vast majority of curing and cross-linking. Yeah, we're getting there, right? Yeah, it was harder. It was harder. So now we'll wait till some of this heat goes away. We're probably getting...\n A good amount of curing going on. It is really tough to rip at this point. It's strong stuff. That tensile strength will get you. That high tensile strength is the same reason the Line-X coated watermelon bounced.\n As it hits the ground, the contents of the watermelon are squeezed out sideways, but the tangle of polyurea molecules\n pull together, preventing the rind of the watermelon from deforming too much and breaking apart. So the watermelon bounces instead of smashing. This type of coating is now used in the walls of the Pentagon, preventing exterior explosions from launching\n shrapnel into the building, the main cause of injury from explosions. And it's used in bulletproof vests to contain bullet fragments that could cause serious injury. All of this is pretty incredible for a substance invented as a truck bedliner.\n down and bring your entire vehicle, anything but your cat.\n And they have been doing some incredible experiments like bowling ball versus axe so go subscribe to their channel go do it right now"

            "transcription": "I am about to drive the world's first car. This was invented by Carl Benz, patented in 1886. Of course, this is not the real thing. This is a replica. But I partnered with Mercedes to make a\n video about car safety. Yeah. Right? There's not a lot of safety here. Safety would come later. You ready? Yeah. I trust you. Awesome. I am driving the world's first\n When he made his patent, what did he call this invention? Patent motor car. This is the gasoline tank. The only place in Germany where you could actually buy Ligroene or gasoline back then were pharmacies.\n They sold it not as a cough medicine, don't worry, they sold it as a stain remover, a washing agent. In Germany there's still the word Waschbenzin, washing gasoline, but no one really knows why it's called like that. Benz had a really thing for safety.\n His ignition is a really modern one because in here there's a battery inside, which was fairly new back then. And of course, igniting the gasoline, oxygen fumes with an electric spark is much safer than if you\n go with your lighter there and you're trying to ignite the whole thing. Let's say the most important part of course is the cylinder with the piston and the piston moves front and back. This is a single cylinder engine. Yeah a single cylinder engine. This is the cooling\n water tank and of course what's really important it's the oil reservoir. Librication is really important because you can see everything is open here and so all the time you lose a lot of oil and for my colleagues it's always a big fuss cleaning this thing up.\n This is the drive belt. It's not just a drive belt, it's also your brake. It's leather, so you can imagine if you do brake a lot, you get problems with the leather band. The flywheel here, we need for the ignition, we needed to start it.\n I'm going to try to get a little bit of a better view of the place.\n Wow! Okay, see, that's really simple. We don't have a lot of stuff here. We just have the steering crank and this is our gas and our brake. Okay.\n You're moving us into gear? Yeah! Whoa! This does feel fast! Oh, it even goes... The top speed of this vehicle was 16 kilometers per hour. That's about 10 miles per hour.\n miles an hour. We can go fast. It feels faster than I was expecting. Just 16 years later, this car could go 80 kilometers per hour. This car in 1928 could already go\n 192 kilometers per hour. By 1938, cars had gotten incredibly fast. This car right here set a record of 432.7 kilometers per hour. That's almost 270 miles per hour. And another driver\n The automobile revolutionized transportation. It allowed people to travel faster than ever before.\n before. But that also created a really difficult physics problem, which is that if you're moving fast and you need to stop or you hit something, you have to decelerate incredibly rapidly, and that creates huge forces on the people inside the car and causing injury\n and sometimes death. And as more and more cars came on the road and traveled faster and faster, the number of fatalities increased, peaking in a lot of developed nations in the 70s. But then scientists and engineers embraced this challenge and figured out\n out new, innovative ways to create cars to minimize those injuries. To improve safety, regular crash testing began in the late 1950s. But what amazes me is the crash test dummy hadn't really been perfected yet, so actual scientists and\n engineers drove the cars in crash tests.\n Well, when they finally did develop crash test dummies, well then people weren't driving the cars anymore, so they needed a different way to propel the vehicle. And so they used this, a hot water rocket, to propel the car into all sorts of\n crash test situations. One of the first major safety innovations that was introduced in a car like this in 1959 was crumple zones, that is regions in the front and the rear of the car that were designed to collapse in the event of an accident. I remember when I was a\n I mean, why would you want your car to collapse? But the point is to increase the distance over which the deceleration occurs, and in doing so, you actually reduce the magnitude of the acceleration of the car.\n and so you reduce the forces on the passengers inside. And that is what saves lives. This vehicle has done a 64 kmph crash frontal impact against a deformable barrier. This is what we classically call the\n the crumple zone. But it's this beam here that's designed to crumple? Exactly. So this takes away a lot of ambient energy by crumpling. The passenger compartment itself is designed with different steel\n qualities if you want, high strength and ultra high strength materials so that it's getting stiffer and stiffer as closer as you get to the passenger compartment. One of the biggest challenges for car safety is Newton's first law that says whatever is moving\n at a constant speed will tend to maintain that constant speed. So if a car hits something, the people inside maintain their constant speed, fly through the windshield, and suffer a very high deceleration when they hit the road. This is why seatbelts are\n so important. They ensure that you stay in the vehicle and decelerate with it. You know when seatbelts were originally introduced they were an option, something you could pay extra for. But once we realized just how useful they are and how they save lives, well they became standard\n and now they are mandatory. Now airbags were made available by Mercedes-Benz for the first time in a series production car in 1981. And again, the idea is similar. In a head-on collision, you want to stop the driver's head from accelerating\n too fast into the steering wheel. And that's what the airbag does. It allows that acceleration to take place over a larger distance and therefore at a lower rate. So it helps preserve the driver's head. What you can also see is, look at this tiny gap here. You can't\n to get your fingers in between. So that steering column has collapsed. Exactly and it has collapsed in a designed way. So after you reach a certain force threshold then the driver basically pushes away the\n entire steering column, including the airbag, by taking away energy. And what you want to do as an engineer for restraint systems is that you want to basically connect the driver-passenger and the occupants as tightly as possible\n to the car in a way that you have the most time to decelerate. Seat belts, crumple zones, and airbags are all passive safety features. They're passive in that they assume a collision is occurring and they're just trying to reduce the acceleration on the passengers inside.\n But there are also active safety systems, like the Anti-Lock Braking System, or ABS, which was introduced by Mercedes in 1978. The idea with ABS is to give you more control, so you may be able to swerve the car and avoid an accident.\n works is by allowing the wheels to rotate rather than locking them up and having the wheels slide across the ground as might happen with traditional braking systems. So with ABS the wheel is allowed to turn and then it's braked hard and then it turns a little\n more, breaks again, and by doing that in quick succession you allow the wheel to stay rolling on the ground and maintain static friction against the road. That actually increases the frictional force and increases your ability to decelerate and also steer around\n a collision. So ABS was a huge improvement over past braking systems. All of these innovations have dramatically improved road safety, but there's always more to be done. And I got to take a look at Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Drive Technology, which is\n which is what they're doing right now to improve safety, performance, and convenience. And I actually made a series of videos about that over on Mercedes-Benz channel. You can click here to check them out. Okay, we're about to go into a dangerous turn and experience the pre-save.\n I can see the sky coming across. Oh my god! I have been in more potentially like crash situations today than I have been for my whole life."

Every year 500 kilograms\n This video was sponsored by\n sponsored by Wren.\n lime, iron is a big one for all the steel, and then there's ceramic and wood. But by far, the solid product we make the most of is cementitious material, essentially cement. We use as much of it as we\n do all other materials combined. And it's easy to see why. Concrete is liquid rock. You can pour it into any shape you like. It's strong and durable and inexpensive, and it is so easy\n to produce that people have been making a version of it for thousands of years. To make primitive cement, the key ingredient is limestone, which is basically calcium carbonate. If you heat it up to around a thousand degrees Celsius,\n this, that drives off CO2 out of the rock, leaving calcium oxide, which is also known as quicklime. Now if you grind up the calcium oxide and mix it with water, you get an exothermic reaction that creates calcium hydroxide, which\n which you can pour into a mold and over a time it will absorb CO2 from the atmosphere turning back into calcium carbonate as the water evaporates. Now that's a pretty good primitive cement, it's the first way that people ever made\n cement, but there are several drawbacks to it. I mean, for one thing, you can't make the molds very big because otherwise CO2 can't penetrate all of the material and harden it. Plus, it's not going to work underwater where there is no CO2 to harden your mixture.\n The Romans discovered the solution to these problems. They added volcanic ash called pozzolana to the crushed limestone before heating it up. And they discovered this cement was much stronger and much more durable. They used it to create the largest\n unreinforced concrete dome in the world, the Pantheon, which has stood for two thousand years. And they built concrete piers into the sea, which hardened underwater, some of which are still standing today.\n I did not expect it to feel this heavy. Like it's already like really weighing down my feet and making me slightly concerned about being able to get out. What I can tell you is that concrete is about three times as dense as water.\n Yeah, okay I'm gonna try to lift a leg just to see how bad it's gonna be what I like is having my feet on the bottom and I'm not sure I can get them back down there after I lift it up but oh boy okay so that was like I'm gonna try to lifting this leg pretty slow\n My fear is that the concrete is so dense that when it gets up around my chest, it may apply a lot of pressure, making it hard to breathe.\n Well, now you mention it. But we do have oxygen on hand just in case.\n Earlier, I practiced how I could get out of the bowl if I'm in trouble.\n So how did Roman concrete harden underwater and in thick slabs that CO2 couldn't possibly penetrate? There is a claim that it was superior to modern concrete, so was\n For centuries, the Roman recipe was lost. It was only discovered in a book in a Swiss monastery in the 1400s. And since then, architects, scientists, and engineers have been experimenting with different cement recipes\n to try to achieve the best result. Now it turns out that that incredible strength, durability, and ability to set underwater of the Roman cement, that came from the Pauzolena, that volcanic ash that was added. And nearly 2,000 years later,\n People discovered that adding clay or shale to the limestone before it was crushed and heated produced the same effect. And the reason is that all of these materials contain silica. And silica totally changes the chemistry of the cement.\n It means that it doesn't need to dry in order to harden. In fact, the water becomes an integral part of that hardened concrete so that it actually achieves maximum strength when it sets underwater.\n So this is the compressive cylinder curing room. We're required to maintain the concrete samples in 100% humidity, so we've chose to submerge them in water in a lime bath. Every time concrete suppliers pour concrete on a job site,\n They cast sample cylinders of the material so they can later test it to ensure it has the strength required.\n casting these compressive cylinders. Every day we're breaking these cylinders, checking it for strength. You can see these have been broken today. This strength increases over time, so samples are tested at 7, 14, and 28 days when the concrete is said to have reached\n full strength. So what we do is we list the date that there will be placed in the compression machine on top of every cylinder. In reality, it will continue strengthening after that. Samples are placed in a hydraulic press.\n and then the pressure is increased on them until they fail.\n middle number is showing us our strength in pounds per square inch and then the top number the big number showing us the force of pounds we're applying. What are we gonna get up to like 7,000 psi? 10,000. 10,000? So this is gonna be really strong. Very strong. Okay.\n It's always fun to get something over 10,000. It's like a free show. Bang! It'll shake this room. And these are reinforced concrete walls. It's amazingly just like you can't see\n see anything happening even under all that pressure. It's still holding. Oh here it goes. Really? 11,000? Over 11,000 now.\n Oh yeah.\n Today, virtually all concrete is\n made with a cement formulation discovered in the 1840s. It's known as Portland cement. But the name is really just a marketing term. You know, they claimed that the gray color of the cement would resemble these very desirable rocks which were quarried near the town\n of Portland, England. But the Portland cement was made by crushing up limestone and then mixing it with a certain percentage of shale or clay to provide the silicates. And that was all ground up into a fine powder and put in a kiln and heated to\n to very high temperatures. And what comes out are these nodules that are really hard. They're called clinker. Now it's suspected that cement chemists in the past may have produced clinker by accident when they overcooked their lime mixtures. But since\n this clinker is so hard to grind down they just considered it waste. But if you do grind it down the cement that it produces is far superior to basically any other chemistry we've discovered which is why it is so commonly used today.\n Now there are lots of compounds inside Portland cement. The most common one is tricalcium silicate. I'm now feeling incredibly buoyant. Like I am now floating in concrete, which is pretty ridiculous.\n because most of my body is out of the material, but because it's three times as dense as water, you can float just up to your waist. This is totally unexpected. I did not expect to be able to like float in concrete. My feet are off the floor.\n that's where my feet are. My feet are here and my shoulders are up and I'm just being pushed up out of this. Once you have the cement pattern the other things you need to make concrete are the aggregates, sand and gravel.\n These are blasted out of a quarry. Then they're ground up to be particular sizes. There are very strict requirements about the sizes and shapes of the aggregate which is going to get poured into the concrete because of course that will affect\n the strength of the concrete that results. Yeah this is a just a well graded concrete sand. The most well rounded material helps the contractor as far as their finishability goes. Yeah. When they're running that trowel over that slab they want a rounded\n particle, not a jagged crushed particle. Do you really want like a spherical sand? Rounded, yeah, spherical sand, like a river stone, like a river sand. Designers on the strip want to pour concrete elevated. They want to lighten up the load of the deck.\n We'll incorporate some lightweight aggregate in place of this normal weight. 3-8 size. Typical concrete will weigh 150 pounds per cubic foot normal weight. This gets us about 110 pounds per cubic foot.\n The aggregates are hauled to the concrete plant in big trucks. Alright, I'm gonna release the rock. Where they're dumped.\n And then they travel on big conveyor belts up into storage piles. These get loaded into big hoppers and then weighed out and poured into the trucks. The control operator is going to open this gate and drop material\n into this hopper, down into the mixer truck below. This is where the batch operator's controlling the plant. Right here in front of our batch operator, William, is the actual recipe that he's going to display.\n fence into the concrete mixer. Each line represents a different component in the concrete. That top one there is a three-quarter rock. We have an intermediate three-eighths rock below it. There's your sand. Over here in this column, he's targeting, for instance, three-quarter rock. He wants to\n hit 13,000 pounds of material for that load. The computer is going to try to hit 13,042 pounds of three-quarter rock. So everything is filling up? Everything is filling up right now.\n Now if he goes out of tolerance and he overshoots a target, it's going to change to red, a red color. Up here on this screen, we're actually showing the holding hopper. This material he's weighing is directly above the mixer truck that just pulled under the plant.\n What about the water, William? Being orange. Yeah, we're a little under on that. We can always add a little water. We cannot take it away. All right, I'm going to take a look inside the truck here.\n That's what it looks like down inside a cement truck. So I was interested to see what would be the difference in strength between pure cement, cement with sand, and cement with sand and\n gravel like the typical concrete mix that they would make so I had them make up these special cylinders and test them in the hydraulic press. You might think that since pure cement has the most glue it would be the strongest. Cement's the magic right the glue so if we lessen\n or lower the amount of cement. Per unit volume, we're going to have less strength. But when we tested the pure cement cylinder, it fractured a lot as the load was applied. Is that it? No, let's let it keep going. It can take some more pressure. What?\n 8000 psi now it failed now cement plus sand 9163 psi. Edit the prediction.\n The friction was based on the strength it was two weeks ago, which we have here. We got 14 days of 6,600, so the reason would be it would probably break another 1,000 psi above that, but it definitely gained a lot.\n cement, plus sand and gravel. This is the normal concrete mix.\n So it did fail at 8,300. Okay. I was surprised to see that all the cylinders broke under about the same pressure.\n I think to me really interesting that you could have all of that cement, right? But you don't get appreciably stronger than like this or that. Cement is the most expensive part of concrete, so if you can get away with reducing\n it down to 30% in the mix and still get the same strength characteristics, well then you should definitely do that. The other thing that was interesting was pure cement seemed to flake and chip more as it was loaded, so it seemed like adding the aggregate actually helped the sample\n cohere and stay together even under all that load. So was Roman concrete superior to modern concrete? Well the answer is no in short.\n There were some surprising advantages that Roman concrete had. For example, it was actually less well mixed than modern concrete. So there were little blocks of undissolved calcium oxide or quicklime that remained inside Roman concrete.\n And then what happened is when the concrete cracked and water got in there, it would dissolve that calcium oxide forming calcium hydroxide and then you would get the new growth of calcium carbonate. So Roman concrete was actually self-healing.\n That's kind of a fascinating advantage. But I would say by and large, you know, when we look back at the Roman structures, we only see the ones that have survived to this day. So there is a survivor bias. And finally, there's the issue of cost. We could make very strong concretes that could last\n an incredibly long time, but we choose not to, because it's just cheaper and we don't expect our buildings to last that long. Before the concrete goes out on site, they have to make sure it's the right consistency for the customer, not too dry and not too\n runny. This can be adjusted with water, but you don't really want to do that because that can also affect the strength. So here, they use modern chemicals like super plasticizers.\n add mixtures. And that's what they're adding now, a super plasticizer. It makes the concrete easier to work and spread around without really changing the water content very much. To check that the consistency is right, they perform something called a slump test or spread test. We're going to\n The concrete they are pouring on me should have a spread of 27 inches.\n We're going to measure it both sides. Right on a 27 on that one. Then go this way. Right on a 27 on that one. So why is it so important that you got the right consistency of concrete? You don't want it too dry.\n You want it wet enough to flow and fill up whatever container you're trying to fill. In this case, the sphere with you in it. So the question you're probably wondering is, how long can I stay in here before the concrete hardens? The usual answer is about\n four hours without agitation. And that's why when you see concrete trucks driving down the road, that drum has to be turning to keep the concrete agitated and prevent it from setting up. But what happens if the truck breaks down or there's a traffic jam or something breaks?\n Then at times concrete does harden inside the drum of these trucks and that is a terrible outcome But there is one thing you can do to slow the concrete down from setting and that is to add some regular\n like coke. The sugars inside this coke actually prevent the setting up process from happening and that can buy you a few hours. So apparently these truck drivers they drive around with a\n few two-liter bottles of pop inside their cab and so they can dump it in their load if they have to to prevent it from setting up so hopefully that means I'll get out okay too. But how does concrete actually\n harden? Well, you have the dry mixture of gravel, sand, and cement powder, and then you add water. The water starts dissolving the cement powder grains, so ions enter solution, and some of those ions are calcium\n hydroxide. So that's what makes concrete a very basic solution. What do you see? We're approaching 12, 11.8. So the pH of concrete can get up to 12 or 13. The pH\n of this is 11.8 and that's incredibly basic which means if it's on your skin if it's on your body it can be dissolving your skin and cells. Being buried in concrete is sort of like jumping in a vat of bleach. And that's why I'm\n So now the ions are dissolved in the solution. And remember, the most common compound in cement is tricalcium\n As it reacts with the water, crystals start to form of calcium silicate hydrates, plus other hydrate minerals. And all these crystals grow and become interlocking, causing the concrete to harden.\n harden. Note that the water is essential to the formation of these crystals. So water is not evaporating, it's not drying out, it's actually becoming part of the solid concrete material. And that's why this chemistry is called cement\n hydration is also why freshly poured concrete should be kept in as damp an environment as possible Las Vegas is so dry they frequently set up misters to spray around new concrete to ensure the humidity was high enough\n One of the things I realized while making this video is that limestone, the core component of cement and concrete, it comes from ancient sea life. Limestone is formed from the skeletons and shells\n of ancient sea organisms that died millions of years ago and then all of that got compressed. And now we use that to make huge skyscrapers and overpasses basically every huge piece of infrastructure. It's made with concrete.\n And so now when you look at a beautiful city skyline, what you're really seeing is ancient marine life. Skyscrapers are made of seashells.\n Yeah, this is wild. This is hilarious. I like I have no words. I'm like trying to push myself down into it\n But it's like it pushes me up like I'm pushing down into the concrete, but it's like well I'm getting pushed out of this thing. I'm just gonna try to push myself down in here Like that is it there is no\n You cannot get buried in concrete, okay? I'm doing my best right now to like sink down and it is not happening. But I'm gonna use my arms to push myself in. Oh!\n Working against buoyancy, this is hard. We were worried about getting me out, but like I can't stay in. I'm going to try to jump in. Here we go. That's it. All right, here we go. One, two, three.\n Three! That's great. That feels so good.\n I like don't want to get out. This is uh, so nice. Does anyone have a time check? This stuff is not gonna set up on me, is it? So as we've seen concrete is one of the most\n important materials in the world. It's made possible most of the large scale infrastructure we rely on. But it also creates a lot of CO2, an estimated 8% of the global total. That is more than the entire aviation sector. But together, we can\n can\n impact. And then if you like, you can offset your carbon footprint by funding a diverse mix of carbon reduction projects like tree planting, mineral weathering, and rainforest protection. For the first hundred people to sign up, I will personally offset your first month of emissions. Just click\n on the link in the description. Now I don't think we're going to solve climate change using individual action alone. If you can change your light bulbs or install solar that is great, but what we really need is change on a systemic scale. And that's what I like about Wren's approach. They not only plant trees\n and protect rainforests, they also support policy groups lobbying for change, like the Clean Air Task Force, which advocates for new technologies and policies to get to a zero emissions economy. The way I see it, there are moneyed interests lobbying to keep things the way they are.\n are. So we need to band together through organizations like REN to lobby for change. And if you agree with me, then I invite you to click the link in the description and join me in offsetting our carbon emissions and investing in large scale systemic change. So I want to thank REN for sponsoring Veritasium\n and I want to thank you for watching."

No, because my rub arm's gonna do all the work.\n Alex was born without a fully formed arm, a condition that affects around 1,500 babies born in the US every year. I'm here to see him get fitted with a new arm.\n You might think of the earliest prosthetic as maybe a peg leg for a sailor, but it actually dates back much further than that. In fact, over 3,000 years ago to ancient Egypt. The thought was that our lives have a finite length, but that the afterlife is eternal.\n And according to the theology of Osiris the body needed to be complete because the soul would leave the body in theory and every night come back to replenish its energy in the body and it was so important that that body be full and so there are\n There are many instances of prosthetic noses, ears, toes, and limbs which were used in ancient Egypt to ensure that the body was complete. But a lot of those prosthetics weren't actually functional. So prosthetics developed from simply being\n aesthetic aids to actually becoming functional. Globally there are an estimated 3 million people living without an upper limb. Over the last 10 to 20 years we've seen remarkable advancement in the development of bionic limbs. The problem with these\n prosthesis is they typically cost on the order of 20 to a hundred thousand dollars. Now here at UCF they are building an arm which can be used and manufactured for much much cheaper like 1% of that cost. How did you get in\n inspired to design an arm for children.\n The arm itself is completely 3D printed and so are the joints between the fingers. There's a cable which runs down the length of\n each finger and back into the hand. They would normally be connected up to this servo motor here. Now the idea is to trigger this motor via the arm of the person who's wearing it. So they would wear three electrodes on their upper arm. When the person wearing the arm squeezes\n there muscle there's a little electrical pulse which triggers this motor to pull in 180 degrees one pulse will close the hand like this and then another pulse will relax it so it opens back up. Our arm provides a level of self-confidence\n to the children. Whenever they're going to school there's questions asked like what happened to your arm? Did you get bit by a shark or run over by a car or something? After we gave him the arm it quickly changed to, oh that's a cool arm. How does it work? Where'd you get it? I like to do stuff on my arm. Like pick up stuff, hold my paper.\n when I'm drawing. I actually bring it to school so I can actually do other stuff. 3D printing is relatively new technology but it provides us a low-cost solution to be able to create things so we can print something out and say it doesn't work.\n redesign it and print it out again the next day. We produce our arm for just about $300 now, whereas some of the prosthetics on the market can go upwards of $40,000. Insurance companies typically don't want to pay for it for kids because every six months you're gonna have to replace it as the kid grows. But this allows us to be able\n able to reproduce an arm for about maybe $100 and just print out anyone. How important is the aesthetic design, the artistic design of the arm? We thought kids just wanted to blend in and feel normal, but we found it's much more about personal identity and expression. We want to make sure the kid is expressing\n The design is so simple that it is easy to print out on location and put together even with very little technical\n knowledge and also the functionality of the design with only three electrodes actuating the one servo make it so that people can learn to use it very quickly and that I think is what makes it so powerful. You think I'll have any luck there? 50-50? 50-50.\n Alright! I can give it to you. I'm excited right now about trying out and I have to do some more souls and do some things I've never done before. I want to play video games with it and hug it too.\n hands. How have you been able to crack this problem that other people haven't before? We have an incredible team of very diverse backgrounds and so bringing all of our common experience together we were able to find this type of solution.\n Our main base is in Orlando, Florida, at the University of Central Florida. We have our designers in California, I'm here in Germany, and everywhere in between we have people trying to help us and support our project. Although it's challenging, we're making it worth it.\n A lot of our communication comes through Microsoft OneNote and we use this product to be able to share information through each other, specifically since Albert is in Germany, so that's a whole ocean away.\n What is the collective project?\n Our biggest needs right now is one, we need funding. We need more donations to be able to make this a reality and make these children's dreams come true. You want to provide free arms to every kid who needs one. Absolutely.\n We don't feel like people should profit from a child without an arm. We're hoping for people to jump on board and help develop arms for their local area. If they want to help with design, they're more than welcome to join our project and be designing arms. They can be printing out arms and helping\n Where do you want to see the Limitless Arm go?\n compass, maybe an elbow, or even an upper limb socket, and then be able to produce this on a larger scale for as many children in the world as we need it. As each child comes to us, we really understand and appreciate the need for readily adaptable\n readily deployable solution to each individual and unique biology. We're trying to get an elbow going for Alex so he can have not only hand movement but he can also move the elbow as well. To overcome that we have to make this also\n bigger to be able to put another servo in there. We like ideas, not just this is our way this is how it has to be, it's anything's possible. We'd like to broaden our field as well. I think we're just at the beginning of something really great and I hope that with a little bit of help\n We're going to be able to take this to the UN and UNICEF and really impact children all over the world. Thank you guys for making this big project for me. That's fantastic. Thank you so much for chatting to me. Thank you. You're very welcome.\n This video was supported by Microsoft OneNote.

            "transcription": "Nitrogen is everywhere. It's a fundamental building block of life, it makes up 78% of the atmosphere, and it's in these tiny micro bubbles in my Starbucks Nitro Cold Brew. And yes, this episode is sponsored by Starbucks. They challenge\n me to liquify nitrogen out of the air and that's what I'm going to be doing in this video but first I'm going to try nitro coal brew for the first time. It's subtly sweet without having to add sugar and obviously it's cold\n and frothy and I'm gonna explain why nitrogen makes this possible but first I'm gonna try to liquify some nitrogen for myself out of this atmosphere. Come on let's go. Okay in order to make liquid nitrogen we need a way to make the air really cold.\n And to do that I'm going to use this cryo cooler. So essentially what's inside here is a cylinder of helium and a couple pistons. So there's a piston that compresses the helium down into this section and when it does that it makes that gas really hot.\n And so that heat gets ejected to the surroundings through this heat sink. Then the helium is expanded down in here and as that happens it gets really cold so it absorbs the heat from the surroundings. So this is the part of the cryoclip\n cooler that is going to get down to less than minus 200 degrees Celsius. So cryogenic temperatures, this is the place where we can really liquefy some gas. So I want to put this to the test and first do a sort of simple proof of concept and make sure that this is working.\n Just try to liquefy air liquefy the air in this room This is Alan pan Alan is handier with tools than I am so brought him in to help me make this happen How should people know you Alan like what do you get into what's your thing? I'm a failed myth buster\n And also I have a YouTube channel called sufficiently advanced you may know Alan from his creations and relevant to this project shooting liquid nitrogen from his hands I'm definitely breaking your drill by the\n way that plastic is coming right off. Did I measure this correctly? Let's see. Does it go in and stop right there? Oh my god look at that! Perfect! So now let's turn it on and you can listen you can hear it turn\n Oh the pump is starting. It's purring. This is the moment of truth. Been running the crowd cooler for about four hours.\n Hopefully getting some liquid air in there. I bet you 50 bucks is at least 50 milliliters of liquid air in there. 50 milliliters. Sir? That's not even that much. It isn't even that much but I'll be amazed if it happens.\n I bring you a 50ml beaker. Do you feel any sloshing? I hear something. I hear something. I hear something. Give me your liquid.\n We have made liquid air. That sounds like... How much have we made? 50 milliliters. Is that how much we've made? Of liquid air. Ohhhhh. 50! 50! Ohhhhh! Dude, that's 50 milliliters of liquid air. Ohhhh.\n I know it doesn't look like much, but to make 50ml of liquid air, we needed to condense around 35 liters of air from the room.\n liquefied gas that I've ever had because we made it ourselves. There was more than 50 ml in there. I know we didn't shake on it, but you definitely owe me $50. I definitely did. Because that's impressive.\n from just a few hours, you know, running it for the first time. Liquid oxygen is paramagnetic, which means it's attracted to permanent magnets. I'm going to use this effect to try to extract some liquid oxygen. Something came out. Oh, dude, you got it. You got some.\n See that droplet at the end of the magnets? To make sure it really was liquid oxygen, we tested how it affected a flame. You can see how the\n matchstick reignites with the liquid oxygen and the flame spreads towards the higher concentration of oxygen.\n There you go we have made liquid air. Next step remove the oxygen and just make liquid nitrogen. Okay it is day two and time to scale up. We are moving the crowd cooler to a bigger\n stand. Should I just go? Yeah go for it. I'm putting a lot of sawdust into your into your carpet I'm sorry. It's okay Allen. To make pure nitrogen we need\n need pressurized air. So I've got an air compressor here in the garage. The pressure of this compressor is about 10 atmospheres. So I'm going to pressurize this line here. Now the first thing we got in the line is a filter to remove water\n vapor. And to get pure nitrogen, this is the key component. It is a nitrogen membrane. And what it actually contains is a bunch of hollow polymer fibers. And so we supply compressed air in this end\n and all of the gas molecules try to diffuse out of those fibers because of that high pressure. But these polymer fibers are made out of a material that is selectively permeable. It allows oxygen and carbon dioxide and water vapor to diffuse.\n fuse out much faster than nitrogen and so those gases actually come out preferentially through these holes. So what you're left with at the end is a high concentration of nitrogen and to get the highest purity what you need to do is have a very high\n pressure and a slow flow rate because that gives a lot of time for those other gases to escape. I don't know about this gauge. So what I want to kind of watch is how long it takes to\n increase the pressure in the tank. But we worked it out yesterday and we figured out if it takes six minutes to fill the tank at 100 PSI then we've got 98% pure nitrogen. Cool, perfect. Right, but we just have to be very careful.\n very slow with this tank filling and I don't know if we are that slow. We're going to try to check the oxygen levels that have come through this membrane. Let's put some money on it. How about 50 bucks says the oxygen is less than 5%?\n I think we're good.\n 95% nitrogen so this meter measures oxygen so we're looking for a number less than 5% which I suspect we will not see oh Can he oh it's going down come on 5% for oh\n There it is whoa Here we go 99 99% not over 99% 99.2. I know I'm sorry I am shocked. There's no oxygen in this air baby. It's all nitrogen 99.5\n I am so shocked right now. So we're at 50 bucks for the liquid air bet. We're at 50 bucks. Yeah, you just won yourself 100 bucks. Look at that 99.7% nitrogen. This is insane.\n You can understand why there would be an alarm if you were in a room with 0.3% oxygen. I knew it! I told you. You knew this would work. Yes. Okay, so we've achieved I guess the second\n part of this which is isolating nitrogen from the atmosphere and now we just have to get super cold. What we gotta do is we gotta put this thing here. For better insulation we scaled up to a doer. That's impressive.\n sci-fi janky garage sci-fi kind of a look. Go ahead and lower that. You know just squish right on. I hope. I mean that's that's sealed you know. I think honestly we\n We could just turn it on and see if it works at this point. Start bleeding some nitrogen in there so that when the nitrogen goes in there it'll push out any remaining air that's still in the tank.\n on the variac which powers up the crowd cooler. The other thing I need is the fan. Yes. This is the fan. I'm going to plug that in. That's a cooling fan for the crowd cooler. We're up to eight watts.\n Okay, I have been running the nitrogen setup for about three hours and my concern, because the temperature on the thermocouple never got very low, was that I wasn't actually making any liquid nitrogen, so\n I've stopped the test and I just want to see whether or not there is anything in here. Doesn't sound like it. Nothing.\n What I think could be part of the problem is putting nitrogen possibly at a rate that's too high. So this is effectively nitrogen coming in at room temperature and I wonder if it was just too warm for it to ever\n reach the liquefying temperature right here at the end of the the cold finger of the cryocooler. So I feel like I need a slower flow rate, maybe a better way to introduce the nitrogen to the dewer. Hmm not as easy as I'd hoped.\n Okay, my plan is to go with a smaller flask, something like this, and we're going to use its lid to make a nice tight seal, except we're going to cut a hole through the top. I think it's good enough for the\n cold finger. Alright, then we're gonna try to drill a hole in the side for the supply of nitrogen. We need to make nice tight seals around both of those things so that is going to be the challenge. This is the kind of the new design here that we've\n Oh god. I feel like it's pretty good. I think it's gonna work. I think you're gonna wake up and there's gonna be like a night shift in there. I bet you $160 that there\n There is liquid nitrogen in there. I don't know if I'll take that. I'm going to turn down the cryocooler and let's see what we got. It looks cold. Yeah, there's definitely some condensation.\n So there's something cold in there. What do you see? Oh, there's liquid nitrogen! There's like this much! That's liquid nitrogen! We have some liquid nitrogen.\n out of the air. So what do you do with homemade liquid nitrogen? Well make homemade ice cream. Just a bit of cream and sugar and then the liquid nitrogen.\n The most precious liquid nitrogen I've ever had. Is it enough to make ice cream? Come have a look, have a look. That is delicious.\n by freezing everything so fast because it is minus 196 Celsius, you get really small ice crystals and so that gives the ice cream a really smooth flavor, smooth texture. In a lot of stores, Starbucks\n The Nitex II generates nitrogen just out of the air because why not? It's an available resource. They purify it and then infuse it in line into the drink creating millions of those tiny bubbles. That gives it its unique texture.\n Nitrogen bubbles are much smaller than the bubbles you're normally used to, the carbon dioxide bubbles that you'd find in soda. And that gives this a sort of creamier texture. The other nice thing about nitrogen is that it's totally inert, so it doesn't react with the drink.\n The nitrogen reacts with water creating some acid, which you might like in soda. You might want a little bit of a sour tangy flavor, but you don't want that in coffee, hence the nitrogen. One thing I found really interesting when they were pouring this nitro-cold brew is that you can actually see\n bubbles coming down on the sides of the glass and that's strange because these bubbles are obviously less dense than the coffee they should be rising up to the surface so why are they doing that well the answer is the nitrogen bubbles are\n rising up to the surface a lot in the center of the drink and so that actually creates a current that pushes them down around the outside and so that's why you see those bubbles cascading down at the beginning when you're pouring the nitro coal brew. So there you have it, nitrogen is everywhere\n and useful for lots of things. If you want to try out a nitro cold brew, I'll put a link to order it down in the description. And thanks for watching.\n you"

            "transcription": "This is Capitol TV.\n Greetings citizens, welcome to the Coriolanus IX solar thermal power plant in the heart of District 5.\n generates over 7% of our proud capital's energy needs. But did you know that you can generate electricity from mere drops of water? I'm going to show you an experiment that does just that.\n Just that. As we turn on the water, it falls through these rings and onto this mesh below. But look here. After a moment, there it is. It generates a spark of roughly 20,000\n thousand volts of electricity and there is no power source here. No turbine as in traditional hydro generation. In fact, there are no moving parts at all. We are creating electricity using only the intrinsic properties of falling\n water. So how does it work? Well, water contains charged particles called ions. It has equal numbers of positive and negative ions, so overall it's neutral. However, as the water falls, there will sometimes be a\n a slight charge imbalance with a little bit more negative charge over here and a bit more positive charge there. Under ordinary circumstances, these variations would even out over time, but not in this case. Here's the ingenious part.\n The mesh on the left is connected to the ring on the right. So if this mesh becomes negatively charged, then so does this ring. And now that ring will attract the positively charged ions in the water.\n So the mesh on the right will now be more positively charged, meaning so is this ring. So what we have is a clear separation of charge. There's a positively charged stream on the right and a negatively charged stream on the left.\n stream on the left. And the more the charge builds up on the meshes, the faster that charge increases. And finally, when we have reached our designed operating voltage of 20,000 volts, electrons jump from the negative rings\n to the positive ones through this spark cap, ionizing the air as they do so. We have created an electric generator with little more than a stream of water droplets. No field of mirrors or enormous coal burning\n plant is required. In fact, with access to the right materials, you could even build this apparatus at home. Thank you for your attention. We citizens of District 5 expand our knowledge to better serve our\n great nation. Love your labor, take pride in your task, our future is in your hands. And don't forget to register for updates from Capital TV. It's mandatory.\n you"

            "transcription": "I'm here at the Navy's indoor ocean at Carderock. This is the biggest wave pool in the world and they can make all kinds of different waves so they can test scale ships and make them better before they actually go out on the open ocean.\n I came in and I'd seen some pictures, but I just walked in here and it's just, it's insane. Because they say indoor ocean, but like it's exactly what it is. The water even looks ocean colored. It doesn't look like a swimming pool.\n It looks like an ocean, it looks like a test facility, it is huge. It is 360 feet long in this dimension, 240 feet long in that dimension. It's 20 feet deep, just about the size of a football field out there. The dome above us was the largest freestanding dome.\n for a while. Largest freestanding dome in the world. Yep. What? In this pool they can make waves of all shapes and sizes using huge paddles that line two walls of the pool. We have 216 individual\n wave makers. We can make waves from negative 45 degrees up to 135 degrees, which is kind of coming right back at it. We are now behind the big paddles that make the waves. These 216 paddles\n are programmed to move in incredibly well choreographed ways so that they can produce reproducible perfect size perfect frequency waves that go across the entire pool. You can see these air bellows that are what's making the\n There are lots of wave pools in the world, but what makes this one different is control. You can create waves of a specific amplitude\n and frequency and do so repeatedly.\n This is the largest wave we can make at 1Hz. That's based on the motion and power requirement for the wave maker. There's something a bit surreal about watching this because it almost looks like an ocean except you never see waves\n One of the fundamental characteristics of a wave is its wavelength, the distance from one crest to the next. The first thing most people learn about waves is they transmit energy rather than material from one place to another.\n In this case, as the wave travels to the right, the water molecules themselves basically move along circular paths, and the deeper the water, the smaller this motion. All motion stops at a depth equal to half the wavelength.\n length. This is known as the wave base. But even in an ideal water wave, the molecules do drift a bit in the direction of wave motion. This is because the molecules travel faster the higher up they are. So they move\n farther at the top of their loop, then they move backwards at the bottom, creating a spiral path. This place is perfect for observing properties of different waves. I asked Miguel to show me some waves with different frequencies, but the same amplitude.\n So what I'll have him do now is I'll have him stop this wave and this change the frequency because we're at point six we'll go to point five so it'll be a two second wave. Here I'm split screening waves with frequencies of 0.67, 0.5, and 0.33\n 3Hz, all with the same amplitude. Two things to notice, even though they all have the same amplitude, the ones with higher frequency look like they have a greater amplitude because the slope of the waves is steeper.\n The frequency of a wave affects its speed. High frequency waves travel slower than low frequency waves. In fact, as long as the water is deeper than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency.\n a\n slower, the lower frequency waves gradually catch up. And they've timed it so that all the waves meet up at exactly the same time and place in the pool, and this causes the waves\n to break. The ocean engineers can do this again, and again, in exactly the same way, thanks to their precise control over the waves. This demo also\n nicely illustrates the principle of superposition, that when waves meet, they add together. The height of the water is equal to the sum of the heights of the individual waves meeting at that point. You can see how much bigger the amplitude is. Those individual\n waves weren't that big, but when you add them all together, you can make this big breaking wave. They can also take advantage of the superposition principle to create standing waves. So what's coming up next are two regular waves coming at each other.\n At some places in the pool, the waves always cancel out to the\n zero amplitude, and at other places the waves add up for maximum amplitude. They can even send waves from all directions, so they form circular wave fronts, and then all the wave energy is channeled into one spot they call the\n bullseye.\n spherical wave and then you have another spherical wave coming from the short bank and this is breaking due to the coalescing waves and the wave height being more than one seventh of the wave length. We tried throwing some toys into the wave to\n see what would happen to them? Would they get pushed into the breaking wave? Even though there's not much net movement of the water, the ducky drifts with the waves and pretty quickly is pushed into the bullseye. How's the ducky doing?\n He's getting to the danger zone right now. He's starting to funnel him right into that breaking wave. It's getting up, getting up. Oh, it swamped it. That's amazing. That was right where we wanted it to be.\n Now the real purpose of this facility is not to play with toys or make perfect unnatural waves, it is to replicate on a small scale the types of waves Navy ships will encounter in the oceans of the world.\n Research engineers place ships modeled after billion-dollar vessels in the water to see how different designs actually behave in real-world conditions.\n to scale it up for this model would be 20 foot waves. When we're doing a free running model like this, we usually run like a racetrack, like a big circle, or a figure eight track so we know the headings that we're running in so that we can correlate that to, you know, the full scale vessel.\n For the model to provide an accurate representation of the real world, a lot of things must be taken into account.\n For fluid mechanics, I always expect that you have to keep the Reynolds number the same as in the real world phenomena.\n But actually, to get the right wave dynamics, you have to use a different scaling, which is based on the Froude number. So the Froude number is a measure of the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces. It's equal to the flow velocity\n In this case, the model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real thing, which means to get accurate data, it should be traveling\n at 1 over the square root of 46 times its real world speed. And to make the footage from the model look the same as that from the full size ship, you have to slow it down by a factor of the square root of 46, so roughly 6.8 times slower.\n I'm amazed at just how well these shots match, but of course that's the idea, scale the model and the waves so the physics are identical to a real ship out on the open ocean. Naturally I asked if I could go\n swimming in the pool, but they said very kindly, no way. The closest I could get would be on a little dinghy. This is our boat. With a catch. It's pretty smooth, smooth sailing out here.\n right now. Yep, no waves while we're out here. So I'm assuming no one's ever been out here in waves? Nope, that's one of the no-nos they don't want us to do. I guess it's a risk thing so. This place seems\n like a massive playground. It kind of is for engineers like us where we kind of dork out on the science and what we're doing here. It's a huge volume. I guess I never understood how deep 20 feet was until they\n it to put in the new wave makers. It's a large volume just taken up by this water. So as we come by, these are our sensors right here. We have a big array here. These are ultrasonic sensors and that's how we measure wave height and periods\n In this pool, they can create all sorts of different wave conditions you might encounter in different parts of the world. Most ocean waves are created\n created by wind, and the strongest winds occur in and around storms. Five factors affect the size and shape of waves created. These are the wind speed, the wind duration, the distance over which the wind is\n acting, which is known as the fetch, the width of the fetch, and the depth of the water. As waves travel out from a storm, the higher frequency waves dissipate their energy more quickly, so the waves that travel a long way are\n the fast-moving, low-frequency waves, which are called swell.\n long waves and that's where you get your open ocean swell. Tell me if this is a good analogy. I feel like with sound a lot of the high frequencies will die off quickly away from a source but the low frequencies will travel much further. Correct. So is it the same thing with the waves? It's\n like you're walking away from a concert and you can still hear like the bass but you can't see any of the high frequencies. That's a great analogy. What's the deal with rogue waves? People like to think it's a rogue wave where it just came out of nowhere and this came up. No, it's usually multiple waves that\n On a calm day,\n when you see waves crashing at the beach around 10 seconds apart, that is swell. But because of its long wavelength, swell isn't really a concern for ships out in the open ocean.\n You're more worried about the steep waves and the windy waves that are really moving you around. Wind waves are formed in three steps. First, as wind blows across the surface of perfectly still water, the turbulent motion of the air\n creates regions of slightly higher and slightly lower pressure, and this makes tiny ripples with wavelengths of around a centimeter. But now the wind can act on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences between the front and the top of\n the wave crest, pulling them up into bigger waves. And the interaction of the wind with these waves then creates even larger pressure differences and even larger waves. The waves are mostly uniform at this point, but as they interact with each other,\n they create a range of different wavelength waves. And as the wind keeps blowing, these waves begin breaking, transferring their kinetic energy into swirling eddies that dissipate their energy as heat. Once the energy dissipation matches the\n energy input from the wind, the waves have reached their maximum size, and this is known as a fully developed sea.\n regular waves were one frequency, one amplitude. This is what we call a spectra or multiple frequencies and multiple amplitudes. You can see there's like higher frequency with the waves that kind of go travel slower than the low frequency waves. Those low\n frequency waves will travel fast and overcome them and that's what's making them look peaky or kind of dulling it out. What surprised me is that the different oceans of the world have different mixtures of wave frequencies or different spectra depending\n depending on their geography and the types of storms that occur there. For example, the North Sea and other small bodies of water have a peakier spectrum, and this is due to the limited fetch of storms that occur there. In the mid-Atlantic,\n The broader spectrum best describes the developing or decaying open ocean waves that you'd find there. And in the North Atlantic, the steady wind across an open ocean produces the broadest spectrum of wind waves. So when testing,\n Engineers first have to figure out where the ship will be deployed and which spectra best match these locations before creating them in the pool.\n The destroyer when I was in command, we did an operation off the coast of South Korea in the spring. Very rough sea keeping conditions. But then like when you're crossing the Pacific, a lot of that is a lot calmer. So again,\n You know, from there to the coast of South Korea to the Arabian Gulf, all those very different conditions. Were there any conditions that were particularly rough for you? So my bed was actually in the middle of a roof.\n room and the seas were so bad and this is either south or east China Sea. The seas were so bad that one night I woke up in the middle of the night and my whole mattress with me on it was sliding off of my bed frame.\n And that's a pretty significantly sized mattress, so you can imagine the seas we were in that night. Much bigger than this would terrify me. I know it probably looks benign, but much bigger than this I think.\n think that model will take a lot of water. Why do you care about how much water goes on the deck? So on the back of this DDG is a helicopter landing pad. They don't want any water on the deck when a helicopter is about to land. That's a big problem. You know that's one of the tests that\n Since I knew they wouldn't want to risk their fancy model in rough conditions, we brought along a little remote controlled boat to test.\n I wouldn't be happy on that boat. A lot of people would be getting seasick. Wow! Oh no! Is it gone? It's gone! No, it's right there. It came up. It's upside down.\n down. It was totally gone. It was in the air, then it went under. Now, not all the models tested here can be remote controlled. So on the carriage is where we're going to do captive model tests where you can test\n put power and instrumentation onto a model that can't hold it itself. So usually the model go in this moon bay right here. The models are hooked up here and then the whole lab speeds over the waves towing the model underneath.\n People have been making ships for thousands of years. Is there actually any innovation today? Most definitely. So sometimes, you know, people say that's the way we've always done it.\n And then when you look into it, there's some validity to some harebrained ideas and when we test them, that's why you cut your costs of doing a model test versus building the full thing and saying, oh, that didn't work. Every ship that's in the Navy's fleet has gone through here, has gone through\n either our purview or has it been tested with peripherally with us but most all of the navy owned ships have been tested in this facility and there is a ship out there with a tumble home design where if you look at this ship behind you it flares out so this flare is usually what helps protect you from when you start\n rolling it gives you a reaction force or helps push you back. A tumble home is shaped the opposite direction and if you have a ship shaped in that direction it doesn't have as much of a restoring force when you roll. But what is the idea with making a ship like\n There's a lot of different reasons why you want to change a whole design. Some of it is the above water signatures. It's all about the shape and radar sections. And you know that there's a lot that goes into that. You always want to be stealthier. You always want to be faster. You always want to have more power. And that's\n That's always what, you know, the innovations come. So most of the sailors aren't aware of the work that's going on in the background to support what they do? When I was in the fleet, and I've been in the Navy 27 years,\n I never had any idea, certainly not the magnitude of what they do. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's impacted every ship and submarine in the fleet.\n Hey, if you don't have a huge wave pool in your house to test out wave physics, I suggest you check out Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Brilliant is the best learning tool I know for mastering concepts in math, science, and computer science. All their lessons are\n built around interactivity. Just check out this one on buoyancy. You can adjust the size of a void in this block and see whether it sinks or floats. And then you proceed through a series of increasingly challenging questions and simulations. You know, what I love\n What I love about Brilliant is that it really gets me thinking. So when I complete a lesson, I feel a sense of accomplishment because I figured it out myself. And this applies to their fundamentals courses as well as to their more advanced topics. For example, the wave principles of\n superposition and interference also apply to their course on quantum mechanics which I found to be both engaging and really comprehensive. This is a great interactive which forces you to deeply engage with the conditions that lead to interference.\n A concept I know a lot of students struggle with. Brilliant keeps supporting Veritasium, I think, for two reasons. First, they know that viewers of this channel are smart and they want to understand things deeply, so a lot of you have already signed up.\n And second, I know that some of you haven't given it a try yet, so I guess my question is, what are you waiting for? You can try it out for free right now by going to brilliant.org slash veritasium. And finally, I want to remind you that with the holiday season coming up, you can give\n the gift of Brilliant to a friend or family member, that clever person in your life who is really into STEM. There are courses tailored for anyone, whether beginner, intermediate, or advanced. And if you sign up right now, Brilliant are offering 20% off an annual premium subscription\n to the first 200 people to sign up. Just use my link brilliant.org slash Veritasium.

Non-renewable sources such as coal.\n What about having nuclear in Australia? Would you want that or not? I don't think I would be supportive. I'm more for like solar and wind power. I would not want it. I would like\n I'd like to see other cleaner technologies pursued such as wind power, green energy, solar power. I mean I don't really know everything about it but it can be pretty dangerous if it does get damaged so I don't know, I think there's better options.\n point of view we have actually many nuclear power plants in Japan right so it's almost like normal now so I can't say anything but yeah Australian people might feel\n or might go against it. The population as a whole, like we don't know much about it but I think mass publicity is very negative about it because of the mistakes. That's debatable. It is debatable. Which side of the debate would you\n Well it's kind of hard to say because it does, like, well it generates energy and whatnot with not using the coal which is running out. And there's different, like they're making more efficient ways to get rid of the waste.\n Although there's still some waste. But then again if you do have a meltdown or something along those lines then it can be really harmful to a lot of people. For nuclear energy, as long as it's away from populations where they sort of start\n stuff can't happen. I mean we have a lot of like spare land so if we stuck it out in the desert somewhere I don't think that it would affect too many people. Would you want nuclear power in Australia? Oh god yes. Yes? Yes. Tell me why. It's clean.\n apart from the waste, but I'm sure we'll figure something out with that. But what about the potential of something like what's happening in Japan? The main one they're worried about there was an old reactor was supposed to go out of commission very shortly. They couldn't\n have foreseen a natural disaster coming. I think it was a bit of a fluke accident and I think every year they're developing these nuclear power plants more and more. We've got a better understanding of it and I think it's a very safe\n viable way of generating power. Well yeah I think it's probably the cleanest alternative we've got at the moment as you know like coal releases a lot of stuff into the atmosphere and I think it'd be very naive to think that doesn't have an effect. Also if you're using something like wind power or something like that you have to clear a lot of\n land to make it viable because it's not really that efficient.

This is what it sounds like. That is weird. It has a metallic ring, first recognized by Aerogel's inventor Samuel Kistler all the way back in 1931.\n Now aerogel is an excellent thermal insulator, but it's not the easiest material to work with. Can I try it? Sure. Oh, I didn't I don't quite have the touch. Why can't I make it ring?\n Oh no. And look, it didn't take a whole lot to break it, right? It breaks pretty easily.

Alright, let's...\n Try it. This is so wrong. It should be a little bit... That looks very hot there. You know, it looks like I'm toasting a marshmallow. Whoa. Why is it flaming like that?\n What is burning? The binder burning out. Correct. You should be able to just hold it right on there. It doesn't feel hot at all. My finger does not feel hot at all. That is insane. So what's the non-flammable binder?\n I cannot believe how little warmth I feel passing through that. The FLIR 1020 thermal camera has different temperature ranges and here the aerogel is clearly hotter than the 160 degree Celsius upper limit. I mean it's glowing\n orange hot so it's clearly incredibly hot I mean if you can see the blackbody radiation you know that it's very hot so we went to the highest temperature range so this goes up to 2,000 Celsius it\n 880 1 907 907 907 degrees Celsius that is absurd right in front of my fingers whoa\n But, so this was about almost 1000 Celsius, but behind this thin layer of aerogel, my fingers are just warm.\n 31 degrees. Wow. Are you a believer? I mean, it is clear this stuff insulates. This video is about taking aerogels extraordinary properties and improving on them. For example, I'm about to\n step into this pool without getting wet. I think there's a layer of air there right next to\n My skin. That thin layer of air is what makes my skin look silvery. Light from certain angles reflects off the water-air interface in what's called total internal reflection. That is very strange. This is a really cool\n effect. I mean just besides the fact that I'm basically waterproof. I feel like this extra air on me is making me more buoyant than usual. Let me try coming out of the water and see if I'm still\n dry. That is trippy. I don't really feel wet at all.\n That was weird. It's really weird. So how did I make myself waterproof? I did it with aerogel particles by taking a bucket of them and coating myself with\n the tiny dust. But this is a kind of strange way to become waterproof because normal silica aerogel is hydrophilic. There we go. Now this is a hydrophilic aerogel so all those OH groups inside\n Aerogel is really good at absorbing water for two reasons. First, it contains a lot of surface area. Due to its nanoscale\n sponge-like structure, an ice cube-sized piece of aerogel contains half a football field of surface area. That makes it good at absorbing lots of molecules, something scientists have sought to exploit.\n today is a good idea is what's the idea is a physical insecticide. So most insecticides work by being neurotoxins. They're called cholinesterase inhibitors. It's the same mechanism as nerve gas and we spray this on crops and things. But a physical insecticide\n side works by basically getting stuck to the outer skin of the insect and basically sucking all the moisture or the oils out of them to the point where they just sort of dry out to death. It's kind of like putting salt on a\n slug or something like that. Yeah, that's a very good analogy, exactly. The other reason it's good at absorbing water specifically is because its structure is covered with OH groups, which attract water molecules. And that makes it ideal for use in museums. In the past, the\n working with a company in Italy called Gopion, which makes museum cases. They made the case for Mona Lisa. They are interested in putting aerogels in the cases because it's a passive moisture regulator. Essentially, once you have it inside, if the moisture increases, the aerogels\n Aerogel's ability to absorb is even being used right now to help detect Marsquakes. This aerogel looks like chalk\n because so-called zeolite particles are dispersed throughout it. They can absorb moisture even at very low pressures. There is a seismometer that contains three small seismometers and it requires, since they're so small, they require a\n exceptional vacuum inside, otherwise the motion gets damped. So that's what we developed this for. The zeolites were helping absorb the moisture predominantly that was coming off of the epoxies and capable of solid gassing and different things.\n It's sort of maintaining the vacuum by keeping to pulling things out. It's essentially a vacuum pump, if you think of it that way. And what's interesting about it is it does not require any power, any consumption, it's very light. So essentially this is what enabled the inside mission to work.\n Aerogel can absorb up to 25 times its weight in water. But for some applications, this is less than ideal. So once we've done this, is that piece of aerogel ruined now? Pretty much. Yeah, that's entropy irreversible data.\n damage there. To counteract this issue, we take a hydrophobe, it's a reactive chemical that when it touches an OH group, spontaneously rearranges with that OH group and creates this big non-polar group and that repels\n water. So by replacing just 30% of the OH groups that lie in the inside of the aerogel with these hydrophobic groups, you can make an aerogel that perfectly repels water. So here, water bounces off. It's totally impervious.\n does not penetrate in and it can sit on water for months and it will be just the same as if it was never wetted at all. You ready? I guess. Let's give it a shot. There it goes.\n It feels funny because it like it hardly feels like the water is touching me because in a way the water isn't touching me. It's not touching you. That's what's amazing. At the molecular level it is being repelled.\n Look how crazy that it's like a weird laminar flow. This is so trippy. So, aerogel can be made impervious to water or more adsorbent. It is naturally brittle, but it can be worked into a\n sticky paste. And so far I've really only focused on silica aerogel, but aerogels can be made out of all sorts of different materials.\n Some of them are made of polymers, and there is a tradeoff between thermal\n and mechanical properties.\n would be between 1.5 to 2 times more insulating than styrofoam, somewhere around 20 to 26 milliwatts per meter Kelvin. This is a polyimid aerogel. This chemistry came from NASA. It's a great insulating material, but it's non-flammable.\n on it, it feels like wood. Internally we call it Martian tape. Another way to make aerogel more workable is to incorporate it into composite materials like blankets. Something that's in between silicone and silica. That feels nice. It feels\n very nice doesn't it? This feels like almost like a stuffed animal. Yeah exactly. So this is a new type of aerogel blanket that in the future we may find in something like an astronaut suit or maybe even apparel. What this material is\n actually it's fiberglass. It does feel like fiberglass. It's fiberglass that's been infused with aerogel and so that fiberglass aerogel composite so because aerogels are traditionally very fragile by compositing it with the fiberglass allows you to make something that can\n be flexed and cut and sewn and wrapped. It's not the most cuddly. It sheds dust when you tap on it. What kind of dust is that going on there? That's silica aerogel. It's a more silica and it's very safe. It's not, for example, like\n This is what they use to insulate the body.\n It subs the oil pipelines and refineries and all sorts of applications. Just that thickness will insulate a pipeline. Yeah, so that thickness, this is one centimeter thick. In one centimeter, you get the same effective insulation value.\n This blanket is actually what I'm going to put to the test in the final episode of the Aerogel trilogy.\n So subscribe if you don't want to miss it.\n you"

            "transcription": "This is the ultimate test of aerogel. I put myself on the line to see who wins in the battle of flame\n thrower versus aerogel. So if you really want to see the insulating properties of aerogel you got to put it to the test and this material here is like the\n most\n It's made of the same material as sand or glass, but if you zoom into the nanoscale, you'd see it has a sponge-like structure, with tiny pores just tens of nanometers across. Now, aerogel can be up to 99.8%\n air, but it's a better thermal insulator than air because those pores are so tiny that hot air struggles to diffuse through them. Plus the nanoscale structure itself is a poor conductor of heat. But aerogen\n Aerogel is pretty fragile in this form and so it's not really practical for most uses. Instead what you can do is actually take tiny particles of aerogel and embed them in a composite material like blankets.\n I just basically rust that makes it opaque to infrared radiation so it's good at stifling conduction, convection and radiation. And on the other side of this insulating aerogel blanket we have Ben who he's\n He's from Cape Cod and responded to a tweet of mine when I asked if anyone in this area has a flamethrower, or not a flamethrower in this case. I did. From the boring company. Have you ever fired this before? I have not, so this will be a first.\n So what we're going to do is try to test what the temperature is on the far side of that blanket when we put the flamethrower at full bore onto this side. Alright, let's do it. Are you ready? I'm ready. Alright, let's give this a try.\n Right here I have the FLIR thermal camera. This is the T1020 which can record up to 2,000 degrees Celsius. First for comparison let's see what this flamethrower can do to something that's not aerogel. Let's put it to\n the test on this super-sized Hershey's Kiss. There you go. Alright, Ben. Within seconds, the temperature of the chocolate is up\n to hundreds of degrees Celsius. Around 30 seconds, the whole thing starts to collapse.\n Even after the flamethrower is removed, parts of the chocolate are still well over 600 degrees Celsius. I think this is what the internet likes. They like really hot things applied to...\n You know, novelty objects. Okay, now is the time to really put aerogel to the test. He's about to put the flamethrower full bore on this side of the blanket. Just one centimeter away will be my hand.\n the backside of the blanket. Okay, I'm ready. Come in.\n I don't feel any heat. It's a little warm. That is crazy.\n It feels a little wholesome. Propane burns at about 2,000 Celsius. So this blanket is going to be an incredible job.\n I barely feel anything.\n That is incredible. It's really taking time for that heat to go through the blanket. It's only a centimeter thin. What does it look like from the back?\n Yeah, that's what it feels like. It feels warm. What about the other side? How hot's the other side? I got over 660.\n Out of range. So this flamethrower was producing over 660 degrees Celsius on this side. Meanwhile on the other side we were just measuring about 50 degrees Celsius. We're going up to the highest range that this camera can do, up to 2,000 degrees Celsius. Awesome. Okay.\n We're not going to be able to see much except for the really hot stuff. Let's go for it. That is just insane.\n But this blanket is still not hot. Can you see that with the thermal? How hot is it? Yeah, it's like 50 degrees C on the thermal. What about the other side? I got 900 at one point. 900 degrees Celsius. Yeah, and it's actually\n still, it's over 200 degrees Celsius right now. Whoa, like right in here? Yeah, right there. And I can still touch it. Can you see my hand prints after\n I touched it? Wow. Now you might be wondering how it's possible to touch something hotter than 100 degrees Celsius without getting burned. Well for that we need to go to another demonstration. This is a hot plate set to around 100\n 150 degrees Celsius and on top of it is a metal plate that is mostly covered in about a millimeter of an aerogel coating called Aerilon. But a small square in the corner is left uncovered. This says about 126, 127 degrees Celsius.\n see us so clearly, hotter than boiling water. So would you put your hand in boiling water? I don't think so, that would hurt. But what about putting it on this coating? So let me try. How's it feel?\n like 130 degrees. It feels hot, but yeah, but it doesn't feel like 130 degrees. I wonder to prove the point. There's some water in a little beaker when I move that. Oh yeah, your finger. Yeah, totally. Your hand\n prints thermal hand prints left behind so I was cooling down the surface you're under that cooling it down over here this is not coated and this is I think slightly hotter it's about yeah it's wow 180 degrees Celsius\n So that is the part I don't want to touch. Yeah, I definitely don't want to touch it because it doesn't have aerogel on it. This is such a thin coating. It's about a millimeter. But even that millimeter of aerogel means that you can touch something that otherwise you would be totally...\n This would definitely burn you. Next to it, there's a little beaker of water with a dropper. Is there? Oh, I moved it. Okay. So take some of that and just approve the point. Put it on the metal square. Let me put some of this on that piece of paper.\n piece of metal here. I'm going to drop a little bit of water on it. Yep, that boils. So we can see. That's really cool is the drops that splattered off onto the Arulan pudding are not boiling.\n Let's have a look here. And this water doesn't boil. Right there. I don't know if this is going to be like heat-turning.\n transfer to the water it gets hot. Put your finger on the airline itself without the water. What like there? Yeah, no big deal right? Yeah, I mean that's not, it's not uncomfortable, it's clearly hot, but it's not like you know putting your hand in boiling water. Which is kind of crazy because\n Because it is hotter than boiling water, but it just doesn't conduct the energy to your hand that fast. That's really weird. They use this for applications, which they call safe touch, so that's something that would normally instantly burn you, something hot enough to boil water.\n you could hold your hand on for minutes and it wouldn't hurt you at all. Okay, so far in this video I focused on using aerogel in hot applications, but it works equally well at the other end of the temperature spectrum, at cryogenic temperatures.\n And this comes in handy for things like liquefied natural gas plants or by NASA when they're using liquid helium. You need really good insulation to keep the heat out. I mean, those cold pipes, if they're not insulated properly, can end up\n with huge ice balls on them, which not only is inefficient, it's also incredibly dangerous. So this is one of the major applications for aerogel these days. If you take a piece of cryogel and dip it in liquid nitrogen for a good while, it is\n still flexible when you bring it out. That's kind of essential when you're working with material that needs to function at ultra cold temperatures. Here is a carbon aerogel that has been submerged in liquid nitrogen and as that liquid nitrogen\n turns back into the gas state, it functions like its own air hockey puck, except instead of the air coming from the table, it comes from the puck itself. You can even buy ski jackets these days that have special aerogel lined pockets,\n that stay significantly warmer than standard jacket pockets and they're specially made for your cell phone so that it doesn't freeze up in the cold weather. You know, I feel like this is a story of something that started as an oddity, as something that didn't really have\n have applications but clearly is an amazing insulation and can be made into a really strong fire retardant material. Why would they insulate subsea oil pipelines with this material? That's a really interesting question.\n So this was what we would call the killer app for aerogel. The oil that comes out of wells in the deep ocean is very viscous and slaggy. And so if you just had a pipe with that oil, it would basically gum up. And so what you have to do is put a\n another pipe around it and fill that gap with insulation. It's called a pipe and pipe configuration. And so they heat the oil, they have to keep it flowing, but you need to insulate that so that it doesn't lose all of its heat to the cold temperatures of the surrounding ocean. So if you think about laying\n and\n the planet that we're big enough to lay that really large diameter pipe for oil pipelines. Aspen Aerogels came along and said, hey guys, we've got this really great new installation. It's three times better than polyurethane, so I can take this much polyurethane foam\n and shrink it into an insulation that's that much aerogel now. What it did was allowed you to shrink the outer diameter pipe of this pipe and pipe configuration substantially and because of that mass reduction from the smaller diameter pipe all of a sudden\n 250 ships around the world collate that smaller diameter pipe without any loss of performance in the oil pipeline. And so that resulted in alleviating years of backlogs of these pipelines that needed to get laid and save billions and billions of dollars.\n Now when we filmed this video, I knew the title would probably be something like flamethrower versus aerogel. But I didn't think of it like a real battle, like what would it mean for the aerogel to win? That it just, you know, didn't get hot or something? But as it turns out, in the flamethrower\n user manual it instructs you only to ever pull the trigger for seven seconds at a time maximum but to get the shot and to get the blanket hot enough I frequently told Ben to pull the trigger for five or ten times that long\n And what we noticed over the course of the shoot was that the flamethrower was working less and less well. And we thought it was out of fuel, but it\n just turned out something inside it was breaking. And by the end we couldn't even pull the trigger. So I'm sorry, Ben. And in the battle of Flamethrower versus Aerogel, I think Aerogel definitely\n one.\n you"

            "transcription": "I'm here at the Navy's indoor ocean at Carderock. This is the biggest wave pool in the world and they can make all kinds of different waves so they can test scale ships and make them better before they actually go out on the open ocean.\n I came in and I'd seen some pictures, but I just walked in here and it's just, it's insane. Because they say indoor ocean, but like it's exactly what it is. The water even looks ocean colored. It doesn't look like a swimming pool.\n It looks like an ocean, it looks like a test facility, it is huge. It is 360 feet long in this dimension, 240 feet long in that dimension. It's 20 feet deep, just about the size of a football field out there. The dome above us was the largest freestanding dome.\n for a while. Largest freestanding dome in the world. Yep. What? In this pool they can make waves of all shapes and sizes using huge paddles that line two walls of the pool. We have 216 individual\n wave makers. We can make waves from negative 45 degrees up to 135 degrees, which is kind of coming right back at it. We are now behind the big paddles that make the waves. These 216 paddles\n are programmed to move in incredibly well choreographed ways so that they can produce reproducible perfect size perfect frequency waves that go across the entire pool. You can see these air bellows that are what's making the\n There are lots of wave pools in the world, but what makes this one different is control. You can create waves of a specific amplitude\n and frequency and do so repeatedly.\n This is the largest wave we can make at 1Hz. That's based on the motion and power requirement for the wave maker. There's something a bit surreal about watching this because it almost looks like an ocean except you never see waves\n One of the fundamental characteristics of a wave is its wavelength, the distance from one crest to the next. The first thing most people learn about waves is they transmit energy rather than material from one place to another.\n In this case, as the wave travels to the right, the water molecules themselves basically move along circular paths, and the deeper the water, the smaller this motion. All motion stops at a depth equal to half the wavelength.\n length. This is known as the wave base. But even in an ideal water wave, the molecules do drift a bit in the direction of wave motion. This is because the molecules travel faster the higher up they are. So they move\n farther at the top of their loop, then they move backwards at the bottom, creating a spiral path. This place is perfect for observing properties of different waves. I asked Miguel to show me some waves with different frequencies, but the same amplitude.\n So what I'll have him do now is I'll have him stop this wave and this change the frequency because we're at point six we'll go to point five so it'll be a two second wave. Here I'm split screening waves with frequencies of 0.67, 0.5, and 0.33\n 3Hz, all with the same amplitude. Two things to notice, even though they all have the same amplitude, the ones with higher frequency look like they have a greater amplitude because the slope of the waves is steeper.\n The frequency of a wave affects its speed. High frequency waves travel slower than low frequency waves. In fact, as long as the water is deeper than the wave base, wave speed is inversely proportional to its frequency.\n a\n slower, the lower frequency waves gradually catch up. And they've timed it so that all the waves meet up at exactly the same time and place in the pool, and this causes the waves\n to break. The ocean engineers can do this again, and again, in exactly the same way, thanks to their precise control over the waves. This demo also\n nicely illustrates the principle of superposition, that when waves meet, they add together. The height of the water is equal to the sum of the heights of the individual waves meeting at that point. You can see how much bigger the amplitude is. Those individual\n waves weren't that big, but when you add them all together, you can make this big breaking wave. They can also take advantage of the superposition principle to create standing waves. So what's coming up next are two regular waves coming at each other.\n At some places in the pool, the waves always cancel out to the\n zero amplitude, and at other places the waves add up for maximum amplitude. They can even send waves from all directions, so they form circular wave fronts, and then all the wave energy is channeled into one spot they call the\n bullseye.\n spherical wave and then you have another spherical wave coming from the short bank and this is breaking due to the coalescing waves and the wave height being more than one seventh of the wave length. We tried throwing some toys into the wave to\n see what would happen to them? Would they get pushed into the breaking wave? Even though there's not much net movement of the water, the ducky drifts with the waves and pretty quickly is pushed into the bullseye. How's the ducky doing?\n He's getting to the danger zone right now. He's starting to funnel him right into that breaking wave. It's getting up, getting up. Oh, it swamped it. That's amazing. That was right where we wanted it to be.\n Now the real purpose of this facility is not to play with toys or make perfect unnatural waves, it is to replicate on a small scale the types of waves Navy ships will encounter in the oceans of the world.\n Research engineers place ships modeled after billion-dollar vessels in the water to see how different designs actually behave in real-world conditions.\n to scale it up for this model would be 20 foot waves. When we're doing a free running model like this, we usually run like a racetrack, like a big circle, or a figure eight track so we know the headings that we're running in so that we can correlate that to, you know, the full scale vessel.\n For the model to provide an accurate representation of the real world, a lot of things must be taken into account.\n For fluid mechanics, I always expect that you have to keep the Reynolds number the same as in the real world phenomena.\n But actually, to get the right wave dynamics, you have to use a different scaling, which is based on the Froude number. So the Froude number is a measure of the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces. It's equal to the flow velocity\n In this case, the model ship's hull is 46 times smaller than the real thing, which means to get accurate data, it should be traveling\n at 1 over the square root of 46 times its real world speed. And to make the footage from the model look the same as that from the full size ship, you have to slow it down by a factor of the square root of 46, so roughly 6.8 times slower.\n I'm amazed at just how well these shots match, but of course that's the idea, scale the model and the waves so the physics are identical to a real ship out on the open ocean. Naturally I asked if I could go\n swimming in the pool, but they said very kindly, no way. The closest I could get would be on a little dinghy. This is our boat. With a catch. It's pretty smooth, smooth sailing out here.\n right now. Yep, no waves while we're out here. So I'm assuming no one's ever been out here in waves? Nope, that's one of the no-nos they don't want us to do. I guess it's a risk thing so. This place seems\n like a massive playground. It kind of is for engineers like us where we kind of dork out on the science and what we're doing here. It's a huge volume. I guess I never understood how deep 20 feet was until they\n it to put in the new wave makers. It's a large volume just taken up by this water. So as we come by, these are our sensors right here. We have a big array here. These are ultrasonic sensors and that's how we measure wave height and periods\n In this pool, they can create all sorts of different wave conditions you might encounter in different parts of the world. Most ocean waves are created\n created by wind, and the strongest winds occur in and around storms. Five factors affect the size and shape of waves created. These are the wind speed, the wind duration, the distance over which the wind is\n acting, which is known as the fetch, the width of the fetch, and the depth of the water. As waves travel out from a storm, the higher frequency waves dissipate their energy more quickly, so the waves that travel a long way are\n the fast-moving, low-frequency waves, which are called swell.\n long waves and that's where you get your open ocean swell. Tell me if this is a good analogy. I feel like with sound a lot of the high frequencies will die off quickly away from a source but the low frequencies will travel much further. Correct. So is it the same thing with the waves? It's\n like you're walking away from a concert and you can still hear like the bass but you can't see any of the high frequencies. That's a great analogy. What's the deal with rogue waves? People like to think it's a rogue wave where it just came out of nowhere and this came up. No, it's usually multiple waves that\n On a calm day,\n when you see waves crashing at the beach around 10 seconds apart, that is swell. But because of its long wavelength, swell isn't really a concern for ships out in the open ocean.\n You're more worried about the steep waves and the windy waves that are really moving you around. Wind waves are formed in three steps. First, as wind blows across the surface of perfectly still water, the turbulent motion of the air\n creates regions of slightly higher and slightly lower pressure, and this makes tiny ripples with wavelengths of around a centimeter. But now the wind can act on these ripples, creating larger pressure differences between the front and the top of\n the wave crest, pulling them up into bigger waves. And the interaction of the wind with these waves then creates even larger pressure differences and even larger waves. The waves are mostly uniform at this point, but as they interact with each other,\n they create a range of different wavelength waves. And as the wind keeps blowing, these waves begin breaking, transferring their kinetic energy into swirling eddies that dissipate their energy as heat. Once the energy dissipation matches the\n energy input from the wind, the waves have reached their maximum size, and this is known as a fully developed sea.\n regular waves were one frequency, one amplitude. This is what we call a spectra or multiple frequencies and multiple amplitudes. You can see there's like higher frequency with the waves that kind of go travel slower than the low frequency waves. Those low\n frequency waves will travel fast and overcome them and that's what's making them look peaky or kind of dulling it out. What surprised me is that the different oceans of the world have different mixtures of wave frequencies or different spectra depending\n depending on their geography and the types of storms that occur there. For example, the North Sea and other small bodies of water have a peakier spectrum, and this is due to the limited fetch of storms that occur there. In the mid-Atlantic,\n The broader spectrum best describes the developing or decaying open ocean waves that you'd find there. And in the North Atlantic, the steady wind across an open ocean produces the broadest spectrum of wind waves. So when testing,\n Engineers first have to figure out where the ship will be deployed and which spectra best match these locations before creating them in the pool.\n The destroyer when I was in command, we did an operation off the coast of South Korea in the spring. Very rough sea keeping conditions. But then like when you're crossing the Pacific, a lot of that is a lot calmer. So again,\n You know, from there to the coast of South Korea to the Arabian Gulf, all those very different conditions. Were there any conditions that were particularly rough for you? So my bed was actually in the middle of a roof.\n room and the seas were so bad and this is either south or east China Sea. The seas were so bad that one night I woke up in the middle of the night and my whole mattress with me on it was sliding off of my bed frame.\n And that's a pretty significantly sized mattress, so you can imagine the seas we were in that night. Much bigger than this would terrify me. I know it probably looks benign, but much bigger than this I think.\n think that model will take a lot of water. Why do you care about how much water goes on the deck? So on the back of this DDG is a helicopter landing pad. They don't want any water on the deck when a helicopter is about to land. That's a big problem. You know that's one of the tests that\n Since I knew they wouldn't want to risk their fancy model in rough conditions, we brought along a little remote controlled boat to test.\n I wouldn't be happy on that boat. A lot of people would be getting seasick. Wow! Oh no! Is it gone? It's gone! No, it's right there. It came up. It's upside down.\n down. It was totally gone. It was in the air, then it went under. Now, not all the models tested here can be remote controlled. So on the carriage is where we're going to do captive model tests where you can test\n put power and instrumentation onto a model that can't hold it itself. So usually the model go in this moon bay right here. The models are hooked up here and then the whole lab speeds over the waves towing the model underneath.\n People have been making ships for thousands of years. Is there actually any innovation today? Most definitely. So sometimes, you know, people say that's the way we've always done it.\n And then when you look into it, there's some validity to some harebrained ideas and when we test them, that's why you cut your costs of doing a model test versus building the full thing and saying, oh, that didn't work. Every ship that's in the Navy's fleet has gone through here, has gone through\n either our purview or has it been tested with peripherally with us but most all of the navy owned ships have been tested in this facility and there is a ship out there with a tumble home design where if you look at this ship behind you it flares out so this flare is usually what helps protect you from when you start\n rolling it gives you a reaction force or helps push you back. A tumble home is shaped the opposite direction and if you have a ship shaped in that direction it doesn't have as much of a restoring force when you roll. But what is the idea with making a ship like\n There's a lot of different reasons why you want to change a whole design. Some of it is the above water signatures. It's all about the shape and radar sections. And you know that there's a lot that goes into that. You always want to be stealthier. You always want to be faster. You always want to have more power. And that's\n That's always what, you know, the innovations come. So most of the sailors aren't aware of the work that's going on in the background to support what they do? When I was in the fleet, and I've been in the Navy 27 years,\n I never had any idea, certainly not the magnitude of what they do. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's impacted every ship and submarine in the fleet.\n Hey, if you don't have a huge wave pool in your house to test out wave physics, I suggest you check out Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Brilliant is the best learning tool I know for mastering concepts in math, science, and computer science. All their lessons are\n built around interactivity. Just check out this one on buoyancy. You can adjust the size of a void in this block and see whether it sinks or floats. And then you proceed through a series of increasingly challenging questions and simulations. You know, what I love\n What I love about Brilliant is that it really gets me thinking. So when I complete a lesson, I feel a sense of accomplishment because I figured it out myself. And this applies to their fundamentals courses as well as to their more advanced topics. For example, the wave principles of\n superposition and interference also apply to their course on quantum mechanics which I found to be both engaging and really comprehensive. This is a great interactive which forces you to deeply engage with the conditions that lead to interference.\n A concept I know a lot of students struggle with. Brilliant keeps supporting Veritasium, I think, for two reasons. First, they know that viewers of this channel are smart and they want to understand things deeply, so a lot of you have already signed up.\n And second, I know that some of you haven't given it a try yet, so I guess my question is, what are you waiting for? You can try it out for free right now by going to brilliant.org slash veritasium.

            "transcription": "An apple weighs about 1 newton. The world record for jet engine thrust is 570,000 newtons, and the Saturn V rocket that launched people to the moon had a thrust of 33,360,000 newtons.\n So how can we measure forces this big accurately? Well, we need to ask this guy. Hi, my name's Rick Seifert. I'm a physical scientist in the mass and force group. Am I supposed to look at the camera? Sure. Okay. You can look at anything you like. Rick manages a dead weight\n machine that can apply 4,448,222 newtons. Why such a strange number? Because that's exactly equal to one million pounds of force. There are 20, 50, 50,000 pound increments in this machine, 20 times\n equals 1 million pounds. Cumulatively that's 4.45 mega Newton. Elsewhere in the world are there larger masses that people have calibrated? I asked that question to every visitor we get and I've not gotten one response that says yeah I know where bigger stuff is\n The machine works like this. Below ground are the 20 carefully calibrated masses. Their weight is used to calibrate\n force sensors, also called force transducers, in the lab upstairs. This is a 1 million pound capacity 4.45 megadoontons and this is 13.3 megadoontons, 3 million pounds force.\n This is the biggest machine of its type in the world and obviously one of a kind. One of these would be placed on the compression head right here. Then a hydraulic ram in the attic starts to raise the green lifting frame.\n And once the force transducer contacts the red loading frame, well then it starts lifting the weights downstairs. And as the lifting frame continues to rise, more and more of the 50,000 pound weights become suspended by the force sensor.\n Since the weights create an accurately known force, the readouts from the force transducer can be precisely calibrated. These devices are then sent out into the field.\n somewhere. Fire! And we have ignition of NASA's Space Launch System solid rocket motor powering us on our journey to Mars. And so the rocket is fired up, perhaps ramped up, ramped down, and those forces are monitored. You know, the old movies you\n When it comes to minimizing uncertainty, these guys aren't messing around.\n pounds of mass. Approximately. Approximately, yeah. Think about that for a moment. Each of these pieces has a mass equivalent to 10 minivans and their exact value is known to within several American nickels.\n few American nickels. Yeah, we're the difference. Yeah. That tiny uncertainty is measured with respect to the very definition of the kilogram using K20. That's the United States fundamental mass standard. This is done by comparing combinations\n of known weights, starting with K20, with larger unknown weights, gradually working up to larger and larger masses. For example, here a single 5kg mass is compared to two 2s and a 1. At some point in this process, they convert and start\n working in pounds going from 50 pound masses to 500 pounds and then 2500 pounds and then using a scale in the floor to reach 10,000 pounds and then 20,000 and finally 30,000 pounds. Combinations of\n these huge weights are then used to calibrate to 50,000 pound masses which form the weight stack. And we have to have that because what we sell is the vertical force vector that's generated by these weights hanging in the gravitational field. We sell that with an uncertainty attack\n to it of 0.0005%, five parts per million, so that means at full one million pounds of applied force, we guarantee that to be accurate if you will within five pounds. Not only does that mean the masses\n have to be accurately calibrated. It also means the gravitational acceleration at this location has to be taken into account. It's actually slightly less than Earth's standard gravity, so an additional 600 pounds are required. Plus, the buoyant force must be counteracted.\n Since these masses displace 125 pounds of air, a further 125 pounds must be added to reach a million pounds of force. What strikes me as kind of amazing is that like this machine needs to exist in a way. Yeah.\n When I would have thought about it, like how would Boeing measure its forces, I would have thought, okay, they just calibrate a device that works up to X, but then they can generalize. Well, generalize, you know what I mean? There's an axiom that's\n And he says, one physical test is worth a thousand expert opinions. And that has proven itself time and again, particularly in the world of physical testing. If you're getting on an airplane that somebody has built, are you willing to accept a 10%?\n Do you sound uncertain on these numbers or do you want it to be the uncertainty of these measurements to be down in the mud? I think that's what you want. Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock.\n you"

            "transcription": "I want to show you how to color a transparent piece of plastic without adding anything to it. No dyes, paint, nothing except holes. But first we have to talk about light. Most people know that it's a form of light.\n of electromagnetic radiation. But have you ever stopped to think about how strange that is? I mean light is a combination of electric and magnetic fields. Electric fields like the ones that make these balloons repel and magnetic fields like the ones\n that make these magnets attract. But how can you strip off the electric field from around charge and the magnetic field from around a magnet and combine those fields together so that they can propagate out through space at the speed of light? Well the key is the electric and magnetic\n magnetic fields need to be continuously changing. And this is usually accomplished by wiggling some electrons. That creates these oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate out through space as an electromagnetic wave. So how big is a\n length of visible light. Well, take a ruler and have a look at a millimeter. Imagine magnifying that millimeter so it's the size of a meter. Now divide that millimeter into a thousand. Or in other words, take a millimeter of a millimeter.\n and then divide that in half and that is the wavelength of green light. Now granted that is tiny but my point is it's not that tiny and nature has actually figured out a way to take advantage of the size of light. Have a look at this blue\n blue morpho butterfly.\n That beautiful iridescent blue color isn't created by a pigment. No, the color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scale.\n If we were to zoom in on this butterfly, we'd see all these little sort of gratings and holes within these gratings that trap the light and reflect out this blue. If we just kind of look at it direct into the light. So we've taken away\n the light that was bouncing off the front. Yeah, you can see that the blue goes away. And all you can see is really the background. In fact, that's because the wings are almost transparent. Without that light being able to reflect off of it, you don't get any blue.\n Scientists like Clint are trying to create similar structures to be used as security devices on bank notes, bank cards and tickets. What you're looking at is just a thin transparent piece of plastic and we've punched little tiny holes. The holes are about 100\n nanometers deep and 100 nanometers in diameter. Each little image that you see on there has about 500 million holes punched into it. And those holes create a three-dimensional kind of grating that allow\n they like to reflect and reflect out and create those brilliant colors. The color is created in a similar way to the color of a soap film. If you carefully study a soap bubble you'll find that you can't see all the colors of the rainbow in the soap\n film. All you can really see is cyan, magenta, and yellow. The reason for that is what the soap film is doing is it's actually removing colors from the light. So the full spectrum of visible light hits the film, but depending on the thickness\n of the soap layer certain colors are removed and so what we see is the spectrum of visible light minus a color that's been taken out. So for example in order to see magenta what we need to do is remove the green light from the spectrum. The light that bounces off the front\n surface will interfere with the light that bounces off the back surface of that soap film. So when it comes out, any light that's about 500 nanometers is removed from the light and what we see is a mixture of the rest of the spectrum. So longer wavelengths than green and shorter wavelengths than green.\n green together they make that beautiful magenta color. So what you want to look for is structures that are similar but can be compatible with many fashion processes where for example a printing press process where you have a big roll of substrate\n It's gonna come along and you've got a big process. It's gonna stamp down and punch in those structures But how could you create like nanoscale structures and punch them into a material? Isn't that nearly impossible? No, not at all, but it sounds like you're gonna manufacture these tiny things\n and then they're not going to break off when you're stamping them in? No, and that's one thing everybody thinks is, oh well they're small and small things are fragile. That's just not the case. One of the reasons that our structures can be strong is that it has a low aspect ratio, which means\n that the height to width is low. So a high aspect ratio let's say might be 10 to 1 so it's long and skinny and that is a weak structure. Ideally you want a structure that's 1 to 1 or maybe 1 to 2 and what we do is we create structures that are 2\n For the moment, Australian bills are made of plastic, and they have this little transparent window in them to stop counterfeiters.\n In future, they'll have hundreds of millions of tiny nanoscale holes instead. The Australians were the ones that invented the polymer banknote. So would you be looking to get your technology in there? Have you been in dialogue with the Australians? I cannot comment on that.\n Hahaha."

            "transcription": "This is a water jetpack, but no that's not\n It's harder than it looks, okay? But to understand how it works, we need to first talk rocket science. Rocket science is meant to be one of the most complicated things in the world.\n But the basic principle is incredibly simple. It's just Newton's third law. All forces come in pairs which are equal and opposite. To demonstrate this I'm using a fire extinguisher on a skateboard. As the carbon dioxide is\n forced out the back of the extinguisher, it puts a force forwards on me, causing me to accelerate.\n Or that's the theory anyway. If you look closely, you can spot the exact moment I realized this is a fail.\n So what was the problem here? Well the force applied to me by the carbon dioxide is equal to the rate of mass ejected out the back of the fire extinguisher, call it m dot for short, multiplied by the velocity of that exhaust gas.\n So in this case the carbon dioxide wasn't ejected fast enough to create a big enough force and overcome the small frictional forces to get me to accelerate. But it can be done as has been demonstrated many times on YouTube.\n When the space shuttle lifts off, exhaust gases exit the nozzle at 3 to 4 kilometers per second, ejecting an amount of mass of 9,000 kilograms per second. This creates thrust equal to 30 million\n or the equivalent of about 2 million decent fire extinguishers. Now imagine you're an astronaut preparing for launch in the space shuttle. You would be seated not vertically, but horizontally perpendicular to the acceleration.\n And that's because the human body is a little bit like a water balloon, where the water represents your blood and the balloon represents your harder parts like your skeleton. Now if you're accelerated up really quickly, then your skeleton accelerates up at that rate by\n but your blood tends to stay where it is. And this results in the blood ending up in your feet. Now since there's not enough oxygen going to your brain, you would black out. But fighter pilots face an arguably worse fate when they accelerate down\n too fast because then the blood all rushes to their head and they suffer something called a red out where the blood actually comes out of their eyes, nose, mouth and ears. But back to astronauts, since you\n reclined at worst the blood will end up in the back of your body and the back of your head but your brain will still have enough oxygen to remain conscious. Now as the spacecraft lifts off and starts speeding up the acceleration is initially a very reasonable five to eight\n meters per second squared. That's less acceleration than an object in free fall here at the surface of Earth. But as the spacecraft continues to burn fuel, its mass decreases while the thrust remains essentially constant. Now new\n Newton's second law says that the acceleration of an object equals the net force applied to it divided by its mass. So as the mass decreases, the acceleration increases. And it increases at an increasing rate. So much so that if\n the end of the rocket burn the thrust has to actually be limited in order to keep the acceleration from going over three G's. That's three times the acceleration due to gravity or about 30 meters per second squared. Now the term G force has\n been invented to give a sense of the amount of force experienced by astronauts in multiples of the force we experience every day. Right now you're experiencing one g-force, probably on your butt if you're sitting down. Can you feel that\n force but accelerating at 3 G's you would experience 3 G forces so the force between your back and the chair would be the same as if you had two of you stacked on top of you. Hey, hike down below.\n You guys are heavy. Oh man. You know that feeling when you're taking off in a plane and it feels like you're pressed into the seat? Well really it's the seat pressing into you. But if you imagine that feeling times\n 20, that's what it would be like to be taking off in the space shuttle. Now an interesting little side note is that we think of the space shuttle's acceleration as being mainly vertical because that's what we see when it lifts off. But that's actually not true. Once the space\n When the shuttle exits the thicker part of the atmosphere, it turns horizontal and accelerates up to its orbital velocity of 28,000 km per hour. So most of the acceleration of a spacecraft, in orbit anyway, is horizontal.\n Is this like a jet pack? Well, unlike the shuttle, you don't carry your own propellant with you. And also, there's no chemical reaction releasing energy that drives the propellant downwards. Instead, the jet ski pumps water out of the lake and up that hose\n at a rate up to 60 liters per second. And then right on these nozzles here, the water changes direction so it goes from coming up to being fired out the bottom and that change in momentum as it goes over the bend is what actually pushes the jetpack up because the jetpack is pushing down on the\n water so by Newton's third law the water has to push up on the jet pack. Generating 1800 Newtons of thrust that's roughly equivalent to a hundred and fifty decent fire extinguishers. This could accelerate me at up to 1.5 G's.\n And you use your hands in order to steer lifting up to drive yourself upwards moving your hands down to accelerate forwards and Pretend like you're turning a big wheel very gently in order to turn side to side one thing you don't want to do\n is try to explain the physics of the jetpack while in the air. That's what I was trying to do here. While you're learning, you're\n your thrust is controlled by your instructor. So if he sees you doing something stupid, he'll just turn off the thrust and drop you into the lake so you don't hurt yourself. That's generally a good idea unless you're on a collision course with the jet ski. I got a pretty fat lip\n from doing this but luckily all my teeth were intact. When the thrust is equal to my weight plus the weight of water in the hose then I can hover or move with constant velocity. It's a common misconception that you need a little bit of undue\n In reality, we are just moving with whatever constant velocity we have.\n what you're pushing off is the propellant. So even without the air around, a water jet pack would still work because you're pushing off the water that is coming out of those nozzles. If you want to go jet packing, I recommend you go easy on the controls. I mean the worst thing you can do is\n overcompensate which I think is a typical human reaction because you're reacting to where you are and how fast you're moving then you're not reacting to acceleration which is the real thing that you can control so even if you're coming down towards the water quite quickly you may be slowing down so\n So it may be okay and you don't need to adjust anything. You just kind of need to trust that the jet pack will get you out of any trouble. It's a pretty incredible experience. Feeling the power of that water rushing past you.\n It's the closest I've gotten to flying really. The power of physics.

            "transcription": "What do this satellite thruster, plastic tool, and micromechanical switch have in common? Well, they all contain components that bend, so-called compliant mechanisms. This episode was sponsored by SimpliSafe. More about them at the end of the show.\n Now about a month ago I was giving a talk in Utah, hence the suit, and that's where I met this guy. Larry Howe, professor of mechanical engineering. So it's always been considered to be bad to have flexibility in your in your machines. Well we've tried to take that\n Now, Professor Howell literally wrote the book on compliant mechanisms.\n But he's pretty nonchalant about his work. Just watch how he introduces this mechanism he developed to prevent nuclear weapons from going off accidentally.\n Hang on, hang on, hang on. What are nuclear weapons? Safing and arming. Safing and arming. Yeah, so if there's anything in the world that you want to be safe, it is not going to accidentally go off. I feel like this is the\n Now, I want to come back to this device and explain how it works. Once we understand why compliant mechanisms are best\n suited to this task. So let's start with something basic.\n and it'll get actually a really high force. I can put that in there and it breaks the chalk. What if you put your finger in there and squeeze it? You would scream in pain. Would you like to try? I would. I would actually like to feel the force.\n You need to squeeze it yourself though. Really? Well alright, I'll squeeze until you scream in pain. That very quickly got incredibly painful. It felt like having my finger like in a\n What I learned in my visit with Professor Howell is that compliant mechanisms have a number\n of advantages over traditional mechanisms, but I thought he needed kind of a clever, pithy way to remember all of these advantages. So I came up with the eight P's of compliant mechanisms, and the first of those is part count.\n Compliant mechanisms have reduced part count because they have these bendy parts instead of having things like hinges and bearings and separate springs. This gripper is just a single piece of plastic but achieves a similar result to the much more common\n complicated vice grips.\n So the simple design\n allows different production processes to be used, which lowers the price. These switches, for example, achieve in one piece of plastic what is normally done with springs, hinges, and many rigid plastic pieces. Also a good fidget device.\n last? We've had these in our fatigue testing machine. We've been able to go over a million cycles without failure. What do we got there? All right, Derek, I've got a quiz. Oh, quiz for you. Okay, I'm gonna... Elephant. I'm gonna...\n Very good. Okay, I'm going to push on the elephant's rump this direction. Okay, I'm going to hold this and that little dot right there. Is that dot when I push on it, is it going to go left, right, up or down?\n I just you know what I wanted to guess without even thinking about it. Please do. I'm gonna say like up and in. Okay. And I kind of feel like that because like that would be a logical way for an elephant to hold his trunk.\n Also because if this is all going over and I feel like this is going to extend there and that's going to get pushed up in there. Good thinking. I don't know, is that good thinking? Well, it's thinking at least. This is designed so that when you push on that, it actually\n just rotates in space it doesn't move at all I knew you were gonna pull some it's a trick question now since I was fooled by it I had to try it out on my friend the physics girl that's so trippy that is so cool I don't\n I don't understand what? It's modeled after the mechanisms you use in wind tunnels where you want to have say a model that's attached here but then you move it and all you want to do is control its angle and not\n Devices like this demonstrate that compliant mechanisms are capable of producing very precise motion, which I personally found pretty counterintuitive because these objects are made\n up of flexible parts. But maybe that shouldn't be surprising, because compliant mechanisms don't suffer from backlash, for one thing. So backlash occurs when you have a hinge, which is basically just a pin in a hole, and it's moving in one direction.\n And now, if at some point the motion reverses, it doesn't happen instantaneously because there's some give in the hinge. This also causes wear and requires lubricant, and that is why compliant mechanisms have better performance.\n performance than their traditional counterparts.\n David or not was inspired when we were doing things at the microscopic level where we were building compliant mechanisms on chips. We had to be able to make these compliant mechanisms out of silicon which is as brittle as glass.\n And if you're trying to make something like this out of glass, right, it's crazy hard. But that also means once we figured out the design, we could make it in a material even like PLA, which is also, you know, not the ideal complaint.\n mechanism material. So you can get on our website and get the files to make this yourself. I'll put a link in the description. Yeah that also has a nice feel and a nice snap to it. It has a really nice snap. I like when it comes out it's\n like gunk. You know, like there's something about that that's really, it's very pleasing. So these things actually move? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need to see this. Okay. All right. We'll do it. Were those etched on there? Yeah, those are etched and, and so\n So just using the same processes used to make computer chips. So another advantage of compliant mechanisms is that they can be made with significantly smaller proportions because they take advantage of production processes like photolithography. And we have motion that we\n want at the microscopic level. That's brilliant. Plus, since they simplify design, compliant mechanisms are much more portable, meaning lightweight, which makes them perfect for space applications. This here is something we did with NASA\n making a hinge that can replace bearings for, say, deploying solar panels. This is titanium, 3D printed titanium. But what's freaky about it is you get that motion, which people expect, but there's a piece of titanium that can bend.\n plus or minus 90 degrees, 180 degree deflection. That is solid titanium. That is one piece of titanium that is 3D printed. There's no alloy, nothing to make it flakey.\n This is an even freakier than this is this guy right there. So that looks like a crazy beast but every part in there has\n purpose. All these flexible beams here are the two inputs and again we did this with NASA for a thruster application where we can put a thruster right there and now with our two motor inputs we can direct that thruster\n in any direction. That titanium device moves out and you notice that it's just all bending and then there's no pinch points for the fuel lines or electrical lines coming in. Here, this\n single piece of titanium allows you to use one thruster in place of two.\n start coming outwards and then if there's a drum around it it'll get a contact with that drum and spin that thing. Oh so this like kind of oh that kind of comes out like so. It gets spinning really fast and then you're essentially\n engage this outer drum. So this is like the way that a chainsaw would work or something like that because you get it spinning fast enough and then it engages the chain and then it turns it over and then yeah. Wow that's cool. So here this is made in plastic so that it\n you can see it, but in reality it's got to be a lot stiffer, so here it is made in steel. So hang on, you're saying that that thing, which is made of steel, you spin it up to a certain speed and then it expands.\n and engages the drum that's around it. Yep. So it will idle with no motion but then at a certain speed that are what we designed it for it'll speed up to that rpm. You speed it up and it engages. Yep. I had no idea\n So let's come back to the Safing and Arming Device for Nuclear Weapons. Its purpose is to ensure that no random vibrations, say from an earthquake, inadvertently disable safeties and arm the nuclear weapon.\n Now one of the requirements was that this device be made as small as possible. With compliant mechanisms,\n They produced a device out of hardened stainless steel, where some components were the size of a human hair. This is high speed video. Here the device is operating at 72 Hz, meaning this little hole makes two complete revolutions each second.\n The way it's meant to work is an arming laser shines on the rotor wheel and when the proper input is given to the system the wheel rotates a notch. If all the proper inputs are given then the hole lines up with the laser beam and crazy things happen from there.\n So it is essential that this device's performance is perfectly predictable, even if it sits unused in a silo for decades. So are these now being used on nuclear weapons? No, it turns out they don't tell.\n us what they do with their nuclear weapons. And so we designed them, we made prototypes, we tested them, and then it goes what they call behind the fence, and where it's all classified and you know, we don't know what happens.\n Hey, this episode was supported by viewers like you on Patreon and by Simply Safe, incredibly effective, reliable home security.

            "transcription": "This is aerogel, the world's lightest, that is least dense solid. This piece has a mass of just 1.22 grams. That is only a few times the mass of the same volume.\n of air, which kind of makes sense because it is 99.8% air. In fact, some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them, they would be less dense than air. I have long been fascinated\n by aerogel so I actually flew out to aerogel technologies in Boston to find out why was aerogel invented? How is it made? Why is it such a good thermal insulator? And what is it used for? Okay we are going to try an experiment to\n demonstrate the insulating power of aerogel. So over here we have two setups, one with a glass petri dish and the other one with aerogel on top. Both are made of silica but with very different\n physical structures. We're going to see how long it takes to melt these chocolate bunnies with a Bunsen burner. Now to have a look at this experiment we have a FLIR T1020 which can see temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius.\n Yeah, you can see that the glass is getting really hot already and after just a minute. It's starting to smoke. Oh Okay, it's definitely melting and smoking. Oh, yeah. Here we go. I would say that that's a phase change. We've got\n We've got a liquid chocolate situation, we have some smoking bunny. Over here the bunny is actually sort of melting over, and look, it's sort of tilting to the side. Alright, I think we're gonna call that a melt. What is that?\n Not only did the bunny melt quickly, the Petri dish cracked under the thermal expansion. So now let's try the aerogel. So how is aerogel\n gel invented.\n Actually a combination of liquids and solids. I mean they're mostly liquid, but it's embedded within this 3D solid structure. So if you think of a gel like Jell-O has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that gives it its rigidity.\n And then that's about 1% of the gel. So the bet was this could you remove the liquid from the jelly without affecting the solid structure? I mean if you just evaporate the liquid out well then the solid structure\n shrinks because as you remove liquid molecules they pull on each other and they pull on the solid structure around them basically crumpling it from the inside. Now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways\n First, he realized you could replace one liquid with another inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly. So you could swap out, say, water for alcohol. And then, if you take the jelly and put it in a high pressure vessel,\n called an autoclave. At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid\n and gas. Those molecules are no longer pulling on each other.\n gas, and that solid skeleton, that nanopore solid, is what we call aerogel. Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931. It is getting pretty hot as you can see through the thermal camera, but coming up on three minutes, there's\n still no sign of melted chocolate.\n It's all the around the bunny exactly that convective heat is moving up and around the aerogel So you can see the thing is getting red hot and by four minutes the bunny is looking a little soft pretty good though Considering how easy this to melt chocolate can I put my finger here?\n Be careful. It's not that it's hot, it's that it's a grill. Right. But yeah, totally cool to touch, right? It is just warm to the touch. He made aerogels out of all sorts of things.\n He made them out of eggs, he made them out of rubber, out of nitrocellulose, and included in there was silica. Actually right here on the table I have some examples of some silica gels. This is a wet silica gel. It's kind of rubbery.\n So I can just, you know, carve out a piece. It is 97% alcohol inside of its pores and then the remaining 3% solid is amorphous silica. Just, can I touch it? Yeah, absolutely. It's kind\n The next step is to replace the alcohol in the gel with liquid carbon dioxide.\n Wood CO2 has the advantage of being non-flammable, plus it's got a low critical temperature. Open it up and... I see it flooding in there. Yeah, it's flooding in. There it goes. Just another solvent. You can clearly see it's just so much cooler on top.\n What temperature is it on the bottom? We're at 600 right now. 600 degrees Celsius. That's 1250 Fahrenheit right now. Notice where the bunny is melting. It's melting right on that edge where the heat's like the flames kind of\n rolling up and over so yeah oh bunny down well not a bad result not a bad result at all I'm interested in tasting some of this chocolate here\n Once the liquid CO2 has filled all the pores of the gel, it's time to take it super critical.\n of a spiritual experience the first time that I saw a supercritical fluid. I love how much you're into these autoclaves. I love aerogels. To make a supercritical fluid we can heat this with a hairdryer actually.\n As we approach the critical point, the surface of the liquid becomes kind of blurry. I'll speed it up so you can watch the surface disappear altogether. You're now looking at the surface\n supercritical fluid of CO2. In this state, the CO2 can be vented without affecting the solid structure, and what you're left with is aerogel. If you look at aerogel on a light background, it's almost impossible\n of\n that the sky is blue, because all those tiny little nanoscale structures scatter the light according to Rayleigh scattering. And the intensity of light scattered is proportional to 1 over wavelength to the power of 4, which means it scatters\n And for that reason, aerogel looks opaque in the ultraviolet and transparent in the infrared. Now, what do you think this would look like if I held it up to the blue sky?\n sky, what do you think we would see? Would it look ultra blue? No, it looks yellow. And that's because the air gel is actually scattering out that blue light, and so what passes through and makes it\n our eyes is the longer wavelengths like the yellows and oranges. It's basically the same effect as looking at a sunset. When you see the yellows and oranges of a sunset, it's because the blue light has already been scattered out by the atmosphere the light had to pass through before\n it reached your eyes. So effectively looking at aerogel against blue sky is like looking at a portable sunset. The nanoscale pores of the aerogel are also what makes it such a good thermal insulator.\n That's awesome. Does that look hot? It's definitely hot. You might think that because aerogel is largely comprised of air, like 99% air, that it has the same thermal properties as air.\n But that is not correct. It's actually a better insulator than air is. That's because the width of the pores is smaller than the distance air molecules travel on average before colliding with something, their so-called mean free path.\n Hence, it's really difficult for the hot, fast-moving air molecules below the aerogel to diffuse through it and transfer heat to the top of the aerogel. This is called the Knudsen effect.\n transparent to block the heat that well but this really does and that's why NASA used aerogel insulation on the Sojourner rover, Spirit and Opportunity, the Curiosity rover and they planned\n to use it on future missions to Mars. NASA has also put aerogel to more exotic uses, notably to catch\n dust from a comet as part of the Stardust mission.\n The particles actually enter the aerogel and as they travel through the aerogel they basically break apart the network that makes up the aerogel and they lose energy in the process and eventually come to a stop. This is good for capturing particles because\n of a particle like that were to hit a solid surface, then it just stops, you know, immediately. And vaporizes. And vaporizes. So should we expect to see aerogel in our everyday lives anytime soon? One of my running jokes is when they build skyscrapers in Antarctica, they'll\n They'll use aerogel as thermal insulation. Why do you say that? Well, because then they'll really care about just how thermal efficient it is because it'd be so cold there. Right. So instead of having, you know, 10 feet of\n of fiberglass insulation, you could have six inches or something of aerotel. Scientists are currently working on reducing costs and increasing durability. That's true, they do have some elastic. Okay. Yeah, there we go. So it is not hard\n They've already made a lot of progress. For example, original silica aerogel is hydrophilic. There we go. Now this is a hydrophilic aerogel. So once we've done this, is that piece of aerogel really\n now pretty much. But there are ways to make it waterproof. So if you want to see that and all the other next-generation aerogels then subscribe to the channel and this may be the start of an aerogel trilogy.\n \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794 \u1794\n you"

            "transcription": "This is the world's largest earthquake simulator. It's called EdaFence. Its huge shake table can support a ten-story building, and then move it in all directions with the force of the world's most destructive earthquakes.\n E-Defense has conducted more than a hundred tests subjecting all kinds of buildings to different simulated earthquakes. All to learn how to make buildings more earthquake resistant.\n Part of this video was brought to you by Shopify. More about them later in the video. On the 17th of January 1995 at 546 in the morning an earthquake struck\n the city of Kobe, Japan. It took everyone by surprise. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. It sits on the boundary of full\n tectonic plates, and 90% of all earthquakes, and almost all of the powerful ones, happen at tectonic plate boundaries. But Kobe isn't near one. This earthquake was caused by an intraplate fault.\n essentially a crack in the Earth's surface that isn't at the boundary of a tectonic plate. This fault hadn't produced any earthquakes for around a thousand years. So the city was completely unprepared.\n The quake measured a magnitude 6.9, just under the definition of a major earthquake. Despite this, the earthquake killed more than 6,000 people and left another 300,000\n homeless. More than 80% of the fatalities were caused by the collapse of buildings. The total economic cost was estimated at $80 billion. In response, the government gathered scientists for a conference on\n earthquake disaster prevention and there they agreed to build the largest earthquake simulator the world had ever seen. So I sent Peter to Japan for an exclusive look inside this facility. So we're entering the world's\n biggest earthquake simulator as they're about to do an experiment. So let's go. Right now there's eight concrete walls that they're gonna feed seismic signals into the shake table and they're gonna see which ones are the most sturdy. So the\n The seismic data that they're going to feed in is from the El Centro earthquake, which was an earthquake that happened on the 18th of May, 1940. It was a 6.9 magnitude earthquake, and it's one of the first ones that we actually have seismic data from. Whoa.\n Okay, things are move wow wow wow wow wow wow Wow oh Okay, it's just really cool to see such a big structure\n kind of moving that far and that fast. Wow. The first test that I actually saw it was on the schedule and it said white noise. So the white noise is just all different frequencies lower\n Frequencies, high frequencies, everything in between. They make this big deal. They're like a one minute like and then they do like the 10 second countdown.\n And then it's just like functionally nothing. We flew all the way to Japan to see this, so let's hope at least one wall falls down. And I couldn't figure out why.\n why for a long time.\n of frequency so we can find natural frequency of building. So first we can put white noise first and after that input earthquake motion and then we usually input another white noise.\n So we can find change of natural frequency. At the center of Iida Fence is a 20-meter by 15-meter shake table, which weighs 800 tons. On each side there are five hydraulic actuators, which push the table side\n side to side, and the whole thing is supported by another 14 actuators at the bottom which move the table up and down. The whole facility is massive. There is one warehouse where the shake table is housed, but it's in such high demand that\n All the buildings are constructed in a separate warehouse and then transferred across. Then there is a whole area full of giant engines and nitrogen storage tanks just to power the shake table. Oh my god, this is a huge engine. Using this setup, the\n scientists can perfectly simulate past earthquakes and determine their effects on different buildings. The shake table can hold masses up to 1200 tons and jolt them with accelerations up to 15 meters per second squared. That's over one and a half\n Now, I know jet fighters can pull like 10 G's as they turn, but it's another story if you're in your house and the floor starts accelerating faster than a falling object.\n The goal of the Shake Table is to realistically simulate earthquakes. To do this, you need two things. A way of being able to apply enough force in a precise and controlled way, and the signal data from real earthquakes. This is how they do it.\n The actuators themselves are hydraulic. Inside each one there's a 30 ton piston driven by high\n pressure oil. But to generate the pressure needed to operate the shake table and sustain it for minutes at a time, e-defense needs huge reserves of pressure\n That's why there's a whole section of the warehouse with massive high-pressure storage tanks full of nitrogen. We have 20 of these red spherical shape accumulators. So we accumulate\n To pressurize these tanks, liquid nitrogen is pumped in from a large storage tank outside, and as that liquid warms up, it turns into a gas and expands 694 times its original volume. It's relatively easy to\n easy to obtain very high pressures with nitrogen. Then, when the pressure is needed, it's transferred to the oil using a bunch of pistons. As the test runs, the oil is pumped to the actuators by these giant engines, but even they can't sustain the pressure\n to operate the shake table for very long, and so the nitrogen pressure reserves mean that the shake table can deliver a consistent amount of force from the start of the test right to the end. While a test is run, the pressurized oil needs to be pumped\n to the actuators by the engines. The flow to each actuator is controlled by electronic servo valves, meaning precisely timed and measured forces can be applied to the table to match any earthquake. Now, because the actuators can only move in one dimension,\n Then, if they were fixed directly to the table, there would be no flexibility and they would break. And so the engineers at E-Defense designed bespoke 7 meter long universal joints to transfer the force from the actuators to the shake table.\n To simulate real earthquakes, the shaking can't be random. Each earthquake has its own characteristic pattern of movement, which can be recorded using a seismometer. Early seismometers were basically just a pen attached to some springs, drawing a line\n over a moving roll of paper and when there was an earthquake the pen would shake and draw out the pattern of acceleration of that earthquake. The trace that was seen on the paper is known as a seismograph. Nowadays we use geophones. A geophone is a\n made from a coil of wire suspended around a magnet, all held together by springs. When the ground shakes, the springs shake, causing the wire to move up and down over the magnet, which generates a current. This current is recorded to produce a seismograph. To get the full picture\n of how the Earth's surface moves in all three dimensions, three geophones are needed, one oriented in each orthogonal direction. The strength of an earthquake is measured on the magnitude scale. The smallest earthquake that humans can feel is about a billion\n times less powerful than the biggest earthquake ever recorded. Because of this, the magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of 1 on the magnitude scale represents a tenfold increase in the force of the earthquake. An earthquake under\n Earthquakes higher than 6 on the magnitude scale can damage buildings, but occur far less frequently. Only a few hundred\n The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the Great Chilean earthquake of 1960, which measured 9.5 on the magnitude scale. It killed somewhere between 1 and 6,000 people and caused more than\n 400 million US dollars worth of damage. But how destructive an earthquake is isn't just determined by the magnitude, it also matters how close the epicenter is. Behind me is what was until 2022 the world's\n The Akashi-kaikyo bridge connects Honshu, the main island of Japan, to Awaji Island, nearly 4 km away. The center span, the distance between the two towers, is 1,990 m.\n 90 meters and 80 centimeters. I'm here because a few kilometers that way and 16 kilometers underground was the epicenter for the great Hanshin earthquake of 1995. As the earthquake struck,\n the bridge was still under construction, and despite being right above the epicenter, there was no major damage to the structure. But the earth underneath the bridge had moved, and the original plans would no longer work.\n plans would need to be modified. So that's how the world's longest suspension bridge became 80 centimeters longer. After e-Defense opened in 2005, one\n One of their first tests was a comparison between two traditional Japanese wooden houses. The houses were transported from the nearby city of Akashi. They were rebuilt on the table and shaken at the magnitude of the Kobe earthquake.\n The house that stayed up had been retrofitted with wooden braces, beams, and metal joints, making it more earthquake resistant. The other was unmodified.\n This test demonstrated that older Japanese houses are not able to withstand powerful earthquakes. It also presented a solution. Some relatively simple and inexpensive structural reinforcement can significantly\n increase earthquake resistance.\n beams, of the buildings that were built post-1981 in Kobe, 0.3% of them collapsed during this earthquake. Of the ones that didn't, 8.4%\n 4%\n you know, watching like the shake table work and I'm just kind of like looking around this entire like this giant warehouse and I see this section where it's just like what looks like IKEA furniture. Can you tell me what this is for? To see\n A lot of the injuries that happen in earthquakes is from stuff falling on top of you.\n A cabinet falling over and hitting your head or you being crushed by a fridge or something like that. Half of the injuries that were sustained indoors in Kobe were from furniture falling.\n on top of people. So one of the things that e-defense does is like how do you make sure buildings don't collapse but it's also how do you make sure that the insides of the buildings are also safe. This part of the video\n This video is brought to you by Shopify. You know, back in 2015, I came up with Snatums, a better way of modeling molecules, and I've been using Shopify to sell Snatums ever since. And over those last eight years, I've found Shopify really easy to work with.\n an all-in-one commerce platform that anyone can use to sell products, manage inventory, or grow their business. One of my favorite things about Shopify is the depth of data that they provide. You can see real-time data on how many people are on your site at any given time.\n time, and how many are checking out. Plus, from the analytics, I can learn which products are selling and when. There are more than 8,000 easy-to-use apps which help with ad tracking, integrating your shop with TikTok or Pinterest, or automatically\n recommending frequently bought products. Despite it being so powerful, Shopify is incredibly easy to use. So if you're just starting out your business or side hustle, or if you want to make the sales process more efficient, you really should be using Shopify. They power\n more entrepreneurs than any other platform with millions of businesses in 175 countries. Seriously, Shopify is great. And for a free trial, you can go to Shopify.com slash Veritasium or just scan this QR code.\n And if you want to buy a Snadam's kit, there is a link for that in the description too. So I want to thank Shopify for sponsoring this part of the video and now back to earthquakes. So for this next test, they're going to feed in the seismic signal.\n from the Great Hanshin earthquake, which is also known as the Kobe earthquake. It only lasted for about 20 seconds, but it had a magnitude of 6.9, and the maximum acceleration was about 0.9g, which is, you know, kind of crazy to see.\n think about for an earthquake. Oh boy.\n like that rumble oh man oh the whole building is oh my god\n How short that was and how powerful that was? Boy.\n Earthquakes are no joke. That's a nice way to observe an earthquake. Like how else can you observe an earthquake without being subject to that shaking, right? No one has got to experience the Kobe earthquake from like just right beside it but not shaking.\n\u30b3\u30fc\u30d9\u30a2\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30012011\u5e74\u306e\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u30a2\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9577\u3044\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30025\u5206\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002\n How do you predict what kind of earthquake you're going to get? Ask seismologist.\n Seismologists give a 70% chance that a magnitude 8 earthquake will occur somewhere near the Tokai region, home to more than 15 million people within the next 30 years. The Nankai trough\n Located off the southeast coast of Japan is where the Eurasian Plate pushes against the Philippine Plate and produces a massive earthquake every 100 years or so. But the Tokai region hasn't experienced such an earthquake in over 160 years.\n The government estimates that more than 320,000 people could lose their lives. Most fatalities will likely be caused by the 30-meter tsunami, but a quarter, around 82,000, could result from building collapse. This is why earthquake preparedness\n This is such a big deal.\n Except in extreme cases, most new buildings in Japan can survive most large earthquakes. So the next challenge is to keep them functional. Currently, even when buildings don't\n water pipes often burst, leaving people without water and electricity. And so they still have to leave their homes. This is the next challenge they're trying to solve at Edafense.\n how to prevent this kind of functional loss. You guys are now at the step that's beyond what I was thinking, right? My step was like, how do we make sure that houses don't fall down? And you guys are like, yeah, no, we figured that out. We can make sure that houses don't fall down.\n What I love about the story of E-Defense is that Japan didn't simply\n wait for more earthquakes to happen and just hope for the best. They spent billions in research to prevent people suffering from these disasters. They realized that while they can't predict the next big earthquake, they can make sure that they are prepared when it does.\n does happen.\n you"

            "transcription": "Engineers are turning to origami for inspiration for all types of applications, from medical devices to space applications and even stopping bullets.\n But why is it that this ancient art of paper folding is so useful for modern engineering? Origami, literally folding paper, dates back at least 400 years in Japan, but the number of designs was limited.\n There were only a handful of patterns, maybe 100, 200 total in Japan. Nowadays, there are tens of thousands that have been documented, and most of that change happened in the 20th century.\n There were a handful of Japanese origami masters and by far the most successful of them was a man named Akira Yoshizawa who created thousands of new designs and wrote many, many books of his works.\n and his work inspired a worldwide renaissance of origami creativity. Well, I wanted to fold a cactus. The first thing one needed to do is figure out how do I get spines on a cactus.\n Imagine if I can make two spines here, I could do the same thing to make a whole row. Then I can go back and do a complete design. That's what this is.\n And this is actually the cactus and the pot are from a single sheet of paper. The paper is green on one side, red on the other. That whole thing is a single sheet of paper. This is one uncut square of paper.\n was that piece of paper? And this is about a one meter square. So there is a huge amount of size reduction to go from a meter down to here, but you need that to get all of the spines. And how long did that take to make?\n That took about seven years from start to finish. Wow. Why is origami this thing that was created for aesthetics mainly? Why is it so useful, I guess, is the question for like,\n know, structural things that were for mechanical engineering or for space applications, like why does it find itself in so many of these applications? Why is it so useful? Well, the thing that makes origami useful is it is\n a way of transforming a flat sheet into some other shape with relatively little processing. This is a folded pattern. It's called a triangulated cylinder. It is bistable, meaning it's\n It's stable in two positions. This is one, and then if I give it a twist, this is the other. This really has a bunch of bistable mechanisms in it because I can, you can see how it sort of pops into place.\n But if you combine the two mechanisms going in different directions, then you get the sort of magical color change effect. Yeah, that's impressive. So you look at this and you say, okay, that is a cute paper toy. Is it anything more than that? And the answer is yes.\n Does that turn into that? That turns into that, yep. We're working with a company called Tuiket Surgical that does the Da Vinci surgical robot where they wanted to be able to insert a flexible catheter with\n with the robot but the flexible catheters tend to buckle and stuff. So we had developed these origami bellows that if you look down there there's a hole that no matter how far we move this that\n that stays the same size on the inside and what that means is we can put the catheter in there and as the catheter moves and is getting inserted into the body it still has supports along the way. Or if\n for another example, here I have a foldable bulletproof collapsible wall. It's based on the Yoshimura crease pattern.\n out of a bulletproof material can be very compact, be in a police officer's car and deploy out and be bulletproof. But would it actually work? Well, they've put it to the test.\n Using 12 layers of Kevlar it can stop bullets from a handgun and a new design featuring interchangeable panels should be able to stop rifle rounds.\n in that vial that is those are actually bullets that have been stopped by origami. An intrinsic benefit of origami is that the simple act of folding a material can make it more rigid. I was gonna ask you about this\n But for engineering applications, the more common challenge is how to fold thick\n rigid materials.\n things, surrogate folds we can use to replace the creases and then also that poly piece of polypropylene folds up and it also accommodates the thickness. By cutting or scoring materials and\n adding hinges as necessary, thick rigid materials can in effect be folded. This is useful for example in deploying solar panels. This pattern is perhaps the granddaddy of deployable structures. It's called the Miura\n It's been used for solar arrays. In fact, it was one of the first patterns that flew on a space mission back in 1995. It was called the Space Flyer Mission. As you see here, it all opens and closes in a single motion.\n Even when it flattens, it's very thin and compact. It's a fun pattern called the origami flasher and you get this kind of interesting flasher motion. This has been proposed as a design for a\n satellite solar arrays, increasing compactness for launch, and reliability in deployment. A new area for origami research is in improving the aerodynamics of freight locomotives.\n is you know they're just like bricks going down the tracks so their aerodynamics are horrible. Ideally I'd like to have a nose cone on the front of a freight locomotive to improve the aerodynamics but you can't because they're like Lego blocks they're hooked up anywhere along the train you'd\n know if it's the first one or the second one or the third one. Here's a scaled prototype showing a pattern that we demonstrated on a freight locomotive. It folds up to be very flat but then deploys out\n And it turns out our computer models and wind tunnel testing show that this will save this one company multiple millions of dollars a year of diesel.\n This is a violinist. He was one of my favorite mechanism designs because he fiddles if you pull his hat. Fantastic.\n The new motions of origami are inspiring new designs for devices, like compliant mechanisms that can complete full 360 degree rotations. Unlike traditional mechanisms with bearings or hinges, I can hook on a motor and I can get continuous rotation.\n I couldn't do that with a compliant mechanism. But it turns out no one bothered to tell the paper folder set and created a\n continuously revolving compliant mechanism, which is called a collidacycle. Origami motions are also being used in medical devices. These would be the creases in the paper and we\n have here now forceps. And so what's nice about this is we could put this at a smaller scale, right, on the medical instrument that go into the body but then can morph and become the grippers. It would be a very small incision but then\n go ahead and do some more complex tasks inside the body. A variant of this mini gripper is now being used in robotic surgeries, replacing the previous mechanism and reducing the number of parts by 75%. The origami inspired\n Our device is smaller but with a wider range of motion. And functional origami can be miniaturized even further. This is the world's smallest origami flapping bird. That sounds cool.\n devoted to developing techniques to make microscopic self-folding origami. And what you see here is a microscope photo of the finished bird, but what the bird actually looks like\n Well, I'll need my macro lens. You'll probably need not just your macro lens, you'll need your microscope because it's smaller than a grain of salt. So it started out, it was a bit less than a millimeter square.\n But when it's folded, it's much much smaller. Wow. Now, you might ask yourself, what would anyone ever use a microscopic flapping bird for? And the answer is, well, nothing.\n for a flapping bird. But there are medical devices, medical applications, implants that are microscopic, where you might want a little machine. This is a nano-injector, used in gene therapy to deliver\n DNA to cells. It's only four micrometers thick. So 400 of them can fit onto a one centimeter wide computer chip. There's some things down there that kind of look a bit Star Wars to me. Yeah.\n This is art called elliptic infinity and we wanted to do that in a material other than paper. You see this from flat into that elliptic infinity shape. This is actually a lamp.\n that's made from a single sheet so it comes in an envelope like this. Put this cable in, fold it, add a clip. Now this relies on a lot of math. The current\n The curvature of these lines affects links, the bending and curvature here to here to here. All of these are coupled and pretty much the only way to design them and get all the folds to play together is by following mathematical methods.\n My professional background is mathematics and physics. I did laser physics for 15 years as a profession. I got my PhD in applied physics. And my job in many cases was to figure out how to describe\n lasers mathematically. And if I could put my problem into mathematical language, then I could rely on the tools of mathematics to solve those problems and to accomplish the goals. But I also felt like\n like origami would be amenable to that same approach. So I started trying to figure out how to describe origami using the tools of mathematics and that worked. I'm sort of fascinated about the\n math here. Like, it's hard for me to conceive of like, what does that math look like? The math comes down to a way of representing a design called a crease pattern. Let me grab a couple of crease patterns. Okay.\n So this is an origami crease pattern. It's a plan for how to fold, in this case how to fold a scorpion. A really good way of designing something like this is to represent every feature\n claw, leg, tail, by a circular shape. It's not circular folds, it's an abstract concept that you represent the pattern by a circle, but then you find on a\n arrangement of those circles on the square like packing balls into a box. So for the scorpion you've got a long tail. Imagine a big circle like a big tin can and the legs are\n smaller circles or circles of different sizes. So you've got different smaller cans and the claws are a couple more circles and you're going to put them into a square box in such a way that they all fit. So you pack the circles in\n of the box and the arrangement of those circles tells you the skeleton of the crease pattern. And from that you can geometrically construct all the crease patterns. You follow rules. Put a line between the center of every pair of circles\n circles. And then whenever any two lines meet in a V, you add a fold halfway in between. It's called a ridge fold. And there's similar, more complicated rules for adding more and more lines, but the thing is it's\n all step by step. It says if you find this geometric pattern that tells you where to add the next line and you go through that process until you've constructed all the lines. And when you're done you can take away the circles, they were the\n scaffolding for your pattern. And the pattern of lines that's left are the folds you need to create the shape. And that's what's shown here. And this was probably the biggest revolution in the world of origami design.\n was if you followed that systematic process, the fold pattern would give you the exact shape that you set out to fold to begin with. The circle packing method that I described, this works for anything that can be represented\n as a stick figure. Like a scorpion you could draw this as a stick figure with a line for the body and tail, lines for each of the legs, lines for the claws. And from that stick figure, from any stick figure, you can use circle packing and get\n But suppose the thing you're folding is not a stick figure. Suppose it's something that's more like a surface, like a sphere, or a cloud, or just in animal terms, a big blobby body like an elephant.\n Stick figure algorithms are not going to work, but there are other algorithms for that. About 10 years ago, a Japanese mathematician named Tomohiro Tachi developed an algorithm that works for any\n surface. You give it a triangulated surface as a mathematical description and he will give you or his algorithm will give you the folding pattern that folds into that surface. It's now quite famous and it's called origamizer and that is a way you could\n make a sheet of anything and take on any three-dimensional shape. So origami is useful in engineering because it provides a method of taking a flat sheet of material and forming it into virtually any shape by folding.\n or if the end product is flat, origami offers a way to reduce its dimensions while still deploying easily. The simple act of folding can increase rigidity, or origami can take advantage of\n flexibility of materials to create specific motions, and its principles are scalable, enabling the miniaturization of devices. Perhaps most of all, origami allows engineers to piggyback on the bright ideas people have had of\n over the centuries while experimenting with folding paper. But translating these ideas into practical solutions requires a lot of math, modeling, and experimentation.\n Hey, this episode of Erotassium was supported by viewers like you on Patreon and by Audible.

You come to my house to watch the tennis and you're not even gonna get me another Coke. Yeah, but it's a tiebreaker. Relax.\n You know what I wish we had? Like a really long straw so we don't have to go downstairs to the kitchen. That would be pretty good. Yeah. Right. How long of a straw could we actually make that you could use? Downstairs would be a bit of a stretch I reckon. Yeah. Yeah.\n Is that like three, four minutes? Yeah, I reckon we could do it. We need a lot of straws though. I got a pack here. Oh, okay. Now our first test, just to see that Nigel can use a straw properly, we've got about a one meter length of straw here.\n you think you can suck through that? I don't know, that's going to be alright. So we just take these drinking straws together and hopefully... yeah that's alright. Well there's a lot of air coming through I think from the\n the joints in the straws. We've got to come up with some better way to test this out. I happen to have 6 meters of plastic tubing here. Non-toxic? That's what they say at the hardware store. Alright, we're preparing the preliminary test. Nigel\n is lowering some tubing off the balcony. He actually thinks he's got a shot at sucking through six meters worth of tubing. I think he's got no chance and it's going to be nowhere close, but this will hopefully allow us to establish how much Nigel actually\n Sucks. He's getting ready up there. He knows there's a lot riding on it. When you ready. Whoa, look at that. Look at that. Oh, he shoots up. He's got two meters. He's got three meters.\n Look at that guy go, he's getting four meters, four meters, five, five meters, six. Yeah! Now I'm gonna try to do the same thing, but the tube I'm using has a thicker diameter.\n Mine is about 5 mil, whereas Nigel's was 3 mil. So we're going to see if this makes any difference.\n Now, I guess the obvious question is, can Nigel do it?\n I don't think that's the obvious answer, but I'm pretty sure he's going to fail. But maybe what we're talking about is how straw works in the first place. How does it work? Yeah, because this is really just a big bendy straw. If we look at a smaller\n version of a straw here. We should all be familiar with how this works, or should we? I don't know, I think most people just think you're sucking the liquid in and swallowing it. But you kind of have to think about air pressure. Yeah, because what is actually happening is that air pressure is what's\n causing the coke in this case to go up the straw.\n pressure and the pressure inside you which gets that liquid flowing into you. It's a bit like high jump and like someone has failed at the five millimeter diameter and then you're the next guy to take it on. You ready for this? I am ready. He's been practicing his whole life for this.\n Yeah, you can see it's a strong start strong strong start from one. You've got it always He's going big right here. You can see there's a lot of determination Getting close look at this\n Look at this, can he do it? Can he do it? Oh, good, he's done it! Cut! Ah, that was disgusting. Yeah, I definitely felt like my tongue while I was trying to suck it up was being pulled out.\n into the straw. I felt the same thing. And it was tough fight, definitely tough fight. Well done sir. Thank you, it means a lot. For his next challenge, we're going to try to get him to suck through 10.3 meters, which is the theoretical maximum\n size of straw. How are you feeling? Well, that theoretical maximum kind of relies on being able to get a perfect vacuum in. Although I am perfect in a lot of ways, I don't know that I can create a perfect vacuum. I've often thought that there's actually a perfect vacuum inside Nigel's head.\n Today we're gonna really find out won't we? Yeah. Okay, we've got the setup here. We're down at Tamarama Beach and we have ten and a half meters worth of tubing which goes all the way up to Nigel at the very top there. So we're gonna see if I can\n relive some of my former glory and get the red liquid up this height. Three, two, one. There you have it, Nydril is starting to suck on that\n draw. There he goes. Looking strong. Create that vacuum. Approaching the edge of a cliff there. Go, Nigel, go! Come on, Nigel! Doesn't seem to be going anywhere.\n We see him a bit stuck. At that point right there, you can see the determination, the focus. Trying to see how high that is. He's done well, but it just doesn't look like it's gonna happen.\n Alright, so Nigel did pretty well there. We saw that he could get the liquid up that tube about seven meters. Not the theoretical maximum of ten meters. Still more than you. That's a good point. That's a good point.\n If Nigel could have created a perfect vacuum, then the water would have gone up to 10.3 meters by our calculations. This is kind of similar to how they used to measure atmospheric pressure in the old days by millimeters of mercury. So atmospheric pressure would push mercury\n up a tube with a vacuum at the other end. 760 millimeters. 760 millimeters so about 0.76 of a meter. So you can see why they would have used mercury and not water because if you were doing this with water you'd need a cliff. Yeah you'd need a 10 meter long\n barometer. So yeah, much better to do it with millimeters of mercury. And of course nowadays we measure it in kilopascals. Anyway, well done Nigel. You really suck.\n Now we work out the maximum length of straw that you could suck through vertically. Think about this, you place the straw into the liquid and you start sucking from the top. That decreases the pressure at the top and the difference in pressure between your mouth and atmosphere\n pressure creates a force that pushes the liquid upwards. Now that liquid which is in the straw has a weight which is equal to the volume of the liquid times its density times the gravitational field strength. So if we set these two forces\n equal to each other, you see that the pressure difference must be equal to the density of fluid times its height times the gravitational field strength. And if we sub in the numbers, we find that the maximum height of liquid that anyone could theoretically lift even if they created a perfect\n inside their mouth would be about 10.3 meters."

            "transcription": "This is the world's largest earthquake simulator. It's called EdaFence. Its huge shake table can support a ten-story building, and then move it in all directions with the force of the world's most destructive earthquakes.\n E-Defense has conducted more than a hundred tests subjecting all kinds of buildings to different simulated earthquakes. All to learn how to make buildings more earthquake resistant.\n Part of this video was brought to you by Shopify. More about them later in the video. On the 17th of January 1995 at 546 in the morning an earthquake struck\n the city of Kobe, Japan. It took everyone by surprise. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. It sits on the boundary of full\n tectonic plates, and 90% of all earthquakes, and almost all of the powerful ones, happen at tectonic plate boundaries. But Kobe isn't near one. This earthquake was caused by an intraplate fault.\n essentially a crack in the Earth's surface that isn't at the boundary of a tectonic plate. This fault hadn't produced any earthquakes for around a thousand years. So the city was completely unprepared.\n The quake measured a magnitude 6.9, just under the definition of a major earthquake. Despite this, the earthquake killed more than 6,000 people and left another 300,000\n homeless. More than 80% of the fatalities were caused by the collapse of buildings. The total economic cost was estimated at $80 billion. In response, the government gathered scientists for a conference on\n earthquake disaster prevention and there they agreed to build the largest earthquake simulator the world had ever seen. So I sent Peter to Japan for an exclusive look inside this facility. So we're entering the world's\n biggest earthquake simulator as they're about to do an experiment. So let's go. Right now there's eight concrete walls that they're gonna feed seismic signals into the shake table and they're gonna see which ones are the most sturdy. So the\n The seismic data that they're going to feed in is from the El Centro earthquake, which was an earthquake that happened on the 18th of May, 1940. It was a 6.9 magnitude earthquake, and it's one of the first ones that we actually have seismic data from. Whoa.\n Okay, things are move wow wow wow wow wow wow Wow oh Okay, it's just really cool to see such a big structure\n kind of moving that far and that fast. Wow. The first test that I actually saw it was on the schedule and it said white noise. So the white noise is just all different frequencies lower\n Frequencies, high frequencies, everything in between. They make this big deal. They're like a one minute like and then they do like the 10 second countdown.\n And then it's just like functionally nothing. We flew all the way to Japan to see this, so let's hope at least one wall falls down. And I couldn't figure out why.\n why for a long time.\n of frequency so we can find natural frequency of building. So first we can put white noise first and after that input earthquake motion and then we usually input another white noise.\n So we can find change of natural frequency. At the center of Iida Fence is a 20-meter by 15-meter shake table, which weighs 800 tons. On each side there are five hydraulic actuators, which push the table side\n side to side, and the whole thing is supported by another 14 actuators at the bottom which move the table up and down. The whole facility is massive. There is one warehouse where the shake table is housed, but it's in such high demand that\n All the buildings are constructed in a separate warehouse and then transferred across. Then there is a whole area full of giant engines and nitrogen storage tanks just to power the shake table. Oh my god, this is a huge engine. Using this setup, the\n scientists can perfectly simulate past earthquakes and determine their effects on different buildings. The shake table can hold masses up to 1200 tons and jolt them with accelerations up to 15 meters per second squared. That's over one and a half\n Now, I know jet fighters can pull like 10 G's as they turn, but it's another story if you're in your house and the floor starts accelerating faster than a falling object.\n The goal of the Shake Table is to realistically simulate earthquakes. To do this, you need two things. A way of being able to apply enough force in a precise and controlled way, and the signal data from real earthquakes. This is how they do it.\n The actuators themselves are hydraulic. Inside each one there's a 30 ton piston driven by high\n pressure oil. But to generate the pressure needed to operate the shake table and sustain it for minutes at a time, e-defense needs huge reserves of pressure\n That's why there's a whole section of the warehouse with massive high-pressure storage tanks full of nitrogen. We have 20 of these red spherical shape accumulators. So we accumulate\n To pressurize these tanks, liquid nitrogen is pumped in from a large storage tank outside, and as that liquid warms up, it turns into a gas and expands 694 times its original volume. It's relatively easy to\n easy to obtain very high pressures with nitrogen. Then, when the pressure is needed, it's transferred to the oil using a bunch of pistons. As the test runs, the oil is pumped to the actuators by these giant engines, but even they can't sustain the pressure\n to operate the shake table for very long, and so the nitrogen pressure reserves mean that the shake table can deliver a consistent amount of force from the start of the test right to the end. While a test is run, the pressurized oil needs to be pumped\n to the actuators by the engines. The flow to each actuator is controlled by electronic servo valves, meaning precisely timed and measured forces can be applied to the table to match any earthquake. Now, because the actuators can only move in one dimension,\n Then, if they were fixed directly to the table, there would be no flexibility and they would break. And so the engineers at E-Defense designed bespoke 7 meter long universal joints to transfer the force from the actuators to the shake table.\n To simulate real earthquakes, the shaking can't be random. Each earthquake has its own characteristic pattern of movement, which can be recorded using a seismometer. Early seismometers were basically just a pen attached to some springs, drawing a line\n over a moving roll of paper and when there was an earthquake the pen would shake and draw out the pattern of acceleration of that earthquake. The trace that was seen on the paper is known as a seismograph. Nowadays we use geophones. A geophone is a\n made from a coil of wire suspended around a magnet, all held together by springs. When the ground shakes, the springs shake, causing the wire to move up and down over the magnet, which generates a current. This current is recorded to produce a seismograph. To get the full picture\n of how the Earth's surface moves in all three dimensions, three geophones are needed, one oriented in each orthogonal direction. The strength of an earthquake is measured on the magnitude scale. The smallest earthquake that humans can feel is about a billion\n times less powerful than the biggest earthquake ever recorded. Because of this, the magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of 1 on the magnitude scale represents a tenfold increase in the force of the earthquake. An earthquake under\n Earthquakes higher than 6 on the magnitude scale can damage buildings, but occur far less frequently. Only a few hundred\n The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the Great Chilean earthquake of 1960, which measured 9.5 on the magnitude scale. It killed somewhere between 1 and 6,000 people and caused more than\n 400 million US dollars worth of damage. But how destructive an earthquake is isn't just determined by the magnitude, it also matters how close the epicenter is. Behind me is what was until 2022 the world's\n The Akashi-kaikyo bridge connects Honshu, the main island of Japan, to Awaji Island, nearly 4 km away. The center span, the distance between the two towers, is 1,990 m.\n 90 meters and 80 centimeters. I'm here because a few kilometers that way and 16 kilometers underground was the epicenter for the great Hanshin earthquake of 1995. As the earthquake struck,\n the bridge was still under construction, and despite being right above the epicenter, there was no major damage to the structure. But the earth underneath the bridge had moved, and the original plans would no longer work.\n plans would need to be modified. So that's how the world's longest suspension bridge became 80 centimeters longer. After e-Defense opened in 2005, one\n One of their first tests was a comparison between two traditional Japanese wooden houses. The houses were transported from the nearby city of Akashi. They were rebuilt on the table and shaken at the magnitude of the Kobe earthquake.\n The house that stayed up had been retrofitted with wooden braces, beams, and metal joints, making it more earthquake resistant. The other was unmodified.\n This test demonstrated that older Japanese houses are not able to withstand powerful earthquakes. It also presented a solution. Some relatively simple and inexpensive structural reinforcement can significantly\n increase earthquake resistance.\n beams, of the buildings that were built post-1981 in Kobe, 0.3% of them collapsed during this earthquake. Of the ones that didn't, 8.4%\n 4%\n you know, watching like the shake table work and I'm just kind of like looking around this entire like this giant warehouse and I see this section where it's just like what looks like IKEA furniture. Can you tell me what this is for? To see\n A lot of the injuries that happen in earthquakes is from stuff falling on top of you.\n A cabinet falling over and hitting your head or you being crushed by a fridge or something like that. Half of the injuries that were sustained indoors in Kobe were from furniture falling.\n on top of people. So one of the things that e-defense does is like how do you make sure buildings don't collapse but it's also how do you make sure that the insides of the buildings are also safe. This part of the video\n This video is brought to you by Shopify. You know, back in 2015, I came up with Snatums, a better way of modeling molecules, and I've been using Shopify to sell Snatums ever since. And over those last eight years, I've found Shopify really easy to work with.\n an all-in-one commerce platform that anyone can use to sell products, manage inventory, or grow their business. One of my favorite things about Shopify is the depth of data that they provide. You can see real-time data on how many people are on your site at any given time.\n time, and how many are checking out. Plus, from the analytics, I can learn which products are selling and when. There are more than 8,000 easy-to-use apps which help with ad tracking, integrating your shop with TikTok or Pinterest, or automatically\n recommending frequently bought products. Despite it being so powerful, Shopify is incredibly easy to use. So if you're just starting out your business or side hustle, or if you want to make the sales process more efficient, you really should be using Shopify. They power\n more entrepreneurs than any other platform with millions of businesses in 175 countries. Seriously, Shopify is great. And for a free trial, you can go to Shopify.com slash Veritasium or just scan this QR code.\n And if you want to buy a Snadam's kit, there is a link for that in the description too. So I want to thank Shopify for sponsoring this part of the video and now back to earthquakes. So for this next test, they're going to feed in the seismic signal.\n from the Great Hanshin earthquake, which is also known as the Kobe earthquake. It only lasted for about 20 seconds, but it had a magnitude of 6.9, and the maximum acceleration was about 0.9g, which is, you know, kind of crazy to see.\n think about for an earthquake. Oh boy.\n like that rumble oh man oh the whole building is oh my god\n How short that was and how powerful that was? Boy.\n Earthquakes are no joke. That's a nice way to observe an earthquake. Like how else can you observe an earthquake without being subject to that shaking, right? No one has got to experience the Kobe earthquake from like just right beside it but not shaking.\n\u30b3\u30fc\u30d9\u30a2\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u5927\u304d\u306a\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u30012011\u5e74\u306e\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u30a2\u30fc\u30b9\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30af\u3067\u306f\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u9577\u3044\u52d5\u304d\u3092\u64ae\u5f71\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u30025\u5206\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002\n How do you predict what kind of earthquake you're going to get? Ask seismologist.\n Seismologists give a 70% chance that a magnitude 8 earthquake will occur somewhere near the Tokai region, home to more than 15 million people within the next 30 years. The Nankai trough\n Located off the southeast coast of Japan is where the Eurasian Plate pushes against the Philippine Plate and produces a massive earthquake every 100 years or so. But the Tokai region hasn't experienced such an earthquake in over 160 years.\n The government estimates that more than 320,000 people could lose their lives. Most fatalities will likely be caused by the 30-meter tsunami, but a quarter, around 82,000, could result from building collapse. This is why earthquake preparedness\n This is such a big deal.\n Except in extreme cases, most new buildings in Japan can survive most large earthquakes. So the next challenge is to keep them functional. Currently, even when buildings don't\n water pipes often burst, leaving people without water and electricity. And so they still have to leave their homes. This is the next challenge they're trying to solve at Edafense.\n how to prevent this kind of functional loss. You guys are now at the step that's beyond what I was thinking, right? My step was like, how do we make sure that houses don't fall down? And you guys are like, yeah, no, we figured that out. We can make sure that houses don't fall down.\n What I love about the story of E-Defense is that Japan didn't simply\n wait for more earthquakes to happen and just hope for the best. They spent billions in research to prevent people suffering from these disasters. They realized that while they can't predict the next big earthquake, they can make sure that they are prepared when it does.\n does happen.\n you"

            "transcription": "This is the biggest, most ambitious, most expensive video I've ever made and it's also going to be terrifying. We are strapping these giant metal weights to the belly of that helicopter, flying it up several kilometers in the sky and then dropping these weights\n Honey Sand Castle City. I mean we need luck.\n And it is all for a very good reason. So let's do it. Come on. In the late 1950s, the United States had a problem.\n The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, into orbit around the Earth on the 4th of October 1957. But less well known is that just over a month earlier, they successfully tested the first intercontinental satellite,\n It could deliver a nuclear warhead from the Soviet Union to cities on the US East Coast in around 30 minutes. Facing this threat, a researcher at the Institute of Nuclear Research at the University of Washington\n at Boeing named Jerry Purnell came up with an idea for a space weapon. It could hit any location on Earth in half that time, just 15 minutes. It could destroy targets buried 30 meters underground, like the silos where the Soviet nukes were kept.\n and theoretically it could intercept ICBM's mid-flight. His concept was to put telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten in space.\n in orbit. So that these pieces of tungsten could drop on a target basically at any time. The idea was within a 15-minute window you would be able to release one of these tungsten rods and have a\n re-enter the atmosphere and strike a target in minutes. And it would come in so fast. You know, in orbit, things go about 8 kilometers per second. And as it enters the atmosphere, it's going to slow down due to the atmospheric drag.\n But still on impact it's still gonna be going like 10 times the speed of sound Mach 10 or about 3 kilometers per second This is Moab which stands for\n massive ordnance air blast, but it's more commonly referred to by its nickname, the mother of all bombs. It is one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosives on the planet. When it detonated, it released the equivalent of 11\n tons of TNT. Now just one of these tungsten rods coming in would have the same energy as the largest conventional explosive ever detonated. They are not bombs. They contain no\n But the amount of energy that they're carrying in their kinetic energy because they are so heavy and they're going so fast, it is as big as any conventional bomb ever detonated.\n Purnell called his weapon Project Thor after the Norse god who threw lightning bolts from the heavens. In the 1980s, the kinetic missile interceptor idea was seriously considered by the Reagan administration. It was codenamed Brilliant\n In 2003, it was resurrected by the Air Force Transformation Plan, which referred to this weapon as hypervelocity rod bundles. But colloquially, the weapon is known as rods.\n from God. The kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to its mass and its velocity squared. So increasing the object's mass ten times increases its kinetic energy ten times.\n But if you increase the velocity by a factor of 10, the kinetic energy grows by a factor of 100. This is why even very light objects can carry lots of kinetic energy. This is what a 15 gram piece of plastic does to a block of\n aluminum when traveling at 6 km per second. And this is a real problem for satellites. Because of the massive speeds on orbit, micrometeorites, small bolts, or even flecks of paint are serious risk\n for the astronauts living on board the International Space Station. This chip in the window of the ISS was caused by a tiny speck of dust, and a small piece of space junk punctured a hole in the robotic arm.\n Imagine something that weighs 10 tons traveling that fast. Kinetic energy weapons appear in fiction, including dozens of movies, video games, and books. But how realistic are they? Could this weapon ever become a weapon?\n come a reality? Well that's why we're here in the middle of the desert. We want to see how damaging a rod from God could be. And we really pulled out all the stops, even hiring a team of professional sandcastle builders to construct a city\n onto which we'll drop the rods. I have all the respect in the world for these sandcastle builders.\n We are seven-time US Open St. Castle champions. That's so cool. It'll endure the test of the highest weight at the highest drop with very little damage. I'm really convinced of that.\n The U.S. Capitol was great. Yeah, isn't that great? Yeah. It's one of our favorites. I love all the buildings there. Who did the pickle? The gherkin? Yeah, the gherkin right here. Very nice. This is beautiful. I mean, I feel bad for trying to...\n Trying to hit it. I am just very concerned about aiming. The city is not that big. So before we get to that drop, we're going to try to hit this swimming pool.\n with a 100 kilogram or a 220 pound mass probably go up about 500 meters try to drop a weight right into this pool. I don't think it's gonna work. I don't think we're gonna hit it. In fact my main concern for the whole day is that we're just not gonna\n to be able to hit anything and then what was the point in coming out here in the first place. These are going to be the questions that I asked myself. So the way we're targeting is with GPS we're going to take a GPS mark from like the center of the pool. Oh boy.\n We've also got GPS in the helicopter. We're going to use that to try to line up square over the middle of the pool. So if we're able to hit this pool from 500 meters, then I think we've got a shot.\n Where's your GPS? My GPS is my phone. And I have the coordinates written on my arm. We're ready to go. We're professionals.\n First drop. Man, it's feeling shaky, I gotta tell ya.\n We've got another 700 feet to be at 1500. Okay.\n I just don't know like why they're circling up that high. Is that 500 meters? That seems really high. 500 meters.\n 1500 feet that seems higher than 1500 feet that is freaking crazy, okay It's swinging around like crazy up here\n there. Yeah does it have fins on it? Jesus no no fins. Why didn't we have this conversation a week ago? Oh geez. That does not look\n like they're in position right are you kidding me oh my what what is that gonna hit oh it is going sideways\n What did it hit? Oh jeez. That was way more off than I thought. Yeah, we were right on it.\n It didn't look like you guys were moving, but... Yeah, he's telling me our horizontal velocity was zero.\n you were in the right spot. We were exactly in the right spot. Oh wow. Oh wow. Look at that. Oh wow. Totally, totally buried. Falling from 500 meters, the rod\n accelerated for 10 seconds, and even accounting for air resistance, it hit the ground going about 350 km per hour. At that speed, with a mass of 100 kg, it was carrying nearly half a million joules of\n Our plan for the day is to drop something twice as heavy from six times higher. Then its energy on impact will be greater than the explosion of a kilogram of TNT. Kinetic impacts are explosive.\n If you look at the craters on the moon and you look really closely, you're going to see that they're basically all circles. I think no one stops to ask, why are they circular? If you imagine when the moon gets hit,\n by asteroids, they're going to come in from all different directions. So shouldn't you get these sort of oblong shapes where the asteroid comes in? Well, the truth is the asteroids come in with such incredible speed that it's not like they're pushing\n dirt out of the way and that's what creates the crater. No, they're coming in so fast that when they collide their kinetic energy is explosive. It heats up the ground, turns things into liquid and gas, they all get super hot and they spray\n outwards in a giant explosion and this explosion is symmetric it doesn't matter which angle or how shallow the asteroid was coming in it's gonna blow out everything radially because it is explosive kinetic energy is explosive\n And I think for me that's just the really surprising thing. It would be the exact same thing with dropping these rods going Mach 10 when they hit a target. They're going to create an explosion as though they are the largest conventional weapon ever launched.\n And because it's going so fast, it can penetrate around 30 meters of soil, enough to bust bunkers or silos. And the explosion is therefore more localized so it can be used for precise surgical strikes. Plus, unlike a new\n nuclear weapon, there's no radioactive fallout to worry about, or international laws. Do these ideas contravene any current laws or treaties?\n space is about nuclear weapons. The only real prohibition is about putting nuclear weapons in space. Man, like I thought targets would be hard to hit. Now I'm like super convinced they're impossible to hit.\n What we're gonna do now we're gonna do much lower altitude and we're gonna do it visually. Yeah, so we're gonna do it, you know, 300 feet visually. I'm gonna do a cube drop. Cube drop is interesting because I was like we shouldn't do a cube drop. We're here talking about rods of God, they're cylinders, right? Now I'm so thankful\n I'm thankful we have the cubes because the cylinders, as Adam Savage told me, who would have thought? I would have thought like, you know, a pencil type thing. It would tend to aim straight\n down. That still looks high. Is that a hundred meters? 30 second call? It doesn't look like they're over the pool. It's totally\n Blowing around in the wind. It's totally swinging. GPS is spot on and I see it right below. It still feels high. We're on it! We're on it! Here we go!\n All right, that wasn't far off. We're off by 60 feet.\n Oh wow, geez, did you look like we were right above it? Look like it, yeah. Wow. Because I showed yours were right on it as well. That's something from a hundred\n I'll take it. Okay we're setting up to drop this mass 200 kilograms 440 pounds what do you think? Are we gonna hit it this time? I hope so.\n This is the moment of truth. We've had two misses so far. So we're going 50 meters or 150 feet above the pool, which for me,\n It's pretty disappointing, but at this point I just want to hit something Oh boy\n The weight is swinging around on there. It's getting blown around by the wind. I mean, we need luck.\n There it goes, there it goes, there it goes. I'm tracking, tracking. We got a head on the pool!\n It hit something! Yes! It was like right on the edge. Right on the edge. This morning I was so worried that we weren't gonna hit anything.\n And like I think the footage is so shaky because I'm so excited but like seeing that from above was amazing Wow it ripped right through the pool Unbelievable\n In all the different incarnations\n of rods from God. The rods are made out of tungsten. And there are two reasons for this. The first is that tungsten is really, really dense. A cubic meter of tungsten weighs 19 tons. That's over twice the density of\n steel, which is what we're using here, just because it's a lot cheaper. But that means for a given amount of mass, tungsten rods could be less than half the volume of steel and therefore encounter less resistance as they pass through the atmosphere. And importantly,\n reentry, tungsten also has an incredibly high melting point, the highest of any metal, at almost 3,500 degrees celsius. This is important because as the rod decelerates through the atmosphere, a lot of heat builds up all around it.\n and tungsten's high melting point means the rods require much less shielding to prevent them from melting. The shape is also important. The goal is to hit the target with as much speed as possible, so a sleek aerodynamic shape is best.\n and rods are a great shape for that. Aerodynamics is why arrows and bullets and ballistic missiles all look the way they do. It's to minimize drag. Honestly, one of the big mistakes we made was not welding fins onto our rods.\n We're going up to about 100 meters or 300 feet before we drop. We're going to hit the Sandcastle City, that's the goal. Any minute, any second.\n There it goes, there it goes, there it goes, it's going. Did it hit in front? Just in front. Just in front? We just missed it. We were close. We were really close.\n So the tractor's gonna dig the weight out right now, just pick it up. Go! That's how it landed. So close to taking out the Capitol. Yeah, look at that. 30 seconds to drop.\n 20 seconds that wind is brutal oh boy oh boy oh boy hit something\n Something on the left, but I don't think it was the city. Seeing all the challenges we're going through reminds me just how difficult it is to aim a kinetic projectile.\n 10 seconds! 3, 2, 1 and drop. There it goes. Did they hit a building?\n What? What? What? I cannot believe it. Direct hit on the building, but it only took down that side. I find it unbelievable.\n Look at the cracks in the back. And like it created cracks but it didn't destroy the whole building. This is not what you would use if you wanted to cause mass devastation. This is like if you wanted to pinpoint a target.\n Now if I'm honest we did not manage to make a fair test of Rods from God even on a small scale. I wanted to drop 200 kilograms from three kilometers but aiming was so hard that we got nowhere near that so we didn't get to\n see the explosive power of kinetic energy. When we made one last-ditch attempt to drop again from 500 meters, I was just terrified that we were gonna hit something or someone. Look out, look out, look out.\n Look out look out I Was just happy to finish the day with everyone safe I didn't shoot that because I was so\n But given the amount of time and money we spent on this video, I would say it is my biggest failure of all time.\n Which as it turns out is also something you could say about the actual weapon, rods from God. I mean just start with aiming. Steering a rod from God is in theory possible. You could use thrusters or adjustable fins or change the rods center of mass.\n mass, but in practice, it's incredibly difficult to aim an object traveling at hypersonic speeds. Not only that, communicating with the rod from the ground or from space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it.\n There are other problems. Say you want to hit a target within 15 minutes. You'd think the simplest thing would be to put a rod right above the target in geostationary orbit. But geostationary orbit is over 35,000 kilometers away. That's almost\n a tenth the distance to the moon. So from there, a rod would take several hours to fall to the Earth. And if you put it in low Earth orbit, say around 350 kilometers above the Earth, the rod will move relative to the ground, doing a revolution around the\n Earth every 90 minutes. So between ordering a strike and the rod hitting the target, that could take anywhere up to an hour and a half. You might think that you could get that time down to about 30 minutes by placing say 10 satellites in that orbit, but remember the\n Earth rotates so orbits drift, you would actually need hundreds of satellites to make sure there's always a rod close by the target. So let's say you want to put a hundred rods into space, well the cost of launching them will be\n billions of dollars and over time the thrusters will break down and malfunction so there are going to be ongoing maintenance costs. But what if you just want to use it for missile defense? Well then you don't need something that weighs 10 tons.\n a smaller rod would do. But even then, it's really, really tricky. And to successfully intercept an ICBM, you've got to hit it during the boost phase. Modern ICBMs split into a number of payloads after the boost. Some of\n of which are decoys to overwhelm anti-ICBM defense missiles. To stop North Korean ICBM launches, for example, the U.S. would need around 400 rods spread among eight orbits to be able to intercept missiles in time.\n A global defense system would require at least a few times that amount. And it's been calculated that even a very limited system would cost around $300 billion, which is nearly half of the US military annual budget. And even that...\n wouldn't work, because enemies could evade the defense by launching several missiles at the same time. Since there's only one rod in the right location at any time, a rod could intercept one of the missiles, but the rest would pass through. So, Rods from God turns\n to be unfeasible to execute in reality. After his stint at Boeing, Jerry Purnell, who came up with the idea, became a science fiction writer. And in his 1985 New York Times bestselling book, Footfall, an alien race uses kinetic weapons\n to invade the earth. And honestly, I'm pretty glad that this weapon is feasible only in science fiction.\n Engineering is all about trying, failing, and sometimes blowing stuff up. And if you can't drop giant steel rods in the desert, well then the next best thing is Brilliant, the sponsor of this video.

            "transcription": "This is the world's largest 3D metal printer. It was built by Relativity Space, a startup that aims to print an entire rocket, including fuel tanks and rocket engines in just 60 days.\n This video is sponsored by Omaze, offering you the chance to win a trip to space. More about that at the end of the show.\n You can film it, but don't look directly at it. You get sunburned fast So it's like you're sitting up to go in a volcano. All right, we're gonna go in to the 3d printer and see how it works All right, see how it works\n Yep, just hold this up, don't look at it. We are in the printer. I can see it over there. If we walk around here we can get up close.\n So that's the wire melting and the print head moving around. So that's the plasma discharge and it's hard to tell but it's doing things at every couple of milliseconds it's actually changing\n The melting point of aluminum is 660 degrees\n Celsius so the whole body of the rocket is effectively melted together one tiny bit at a time All the raw metal for the whole the whole rocket that's printed is this it's a you know, we kind of joke it's like Charlotte's\n web like a spider silk but this is an aluminum alloy that's on a wire spool. We actually print about 10 inches a second so this wire is really going super fast and then the combination of laser\n The lasers and plasma arc discharge are working to melt both of them together at the same time. So where does the wire come out? So it's right there. And then the electric arc discharge happens right at the tip of the wire too.\n This is a camera? Yeah, that's a camera. But why would you want to 3D print a rocket? Is it just because we can? It's funny to me that you had this experience with 3D printing where you're like, oh, 3D printing is clearly the future. Whereas I feel like a lot of people's experience with\n 3D printers as mine has been. It's like incredibly frustrating. I feel like 3D printing is that thing that seems like it should be great and yet whenever I try it I don't get a result that I'm happy with. Yeah I know I can tell you we had plenty of experiences the first\n couple years where we ended up with a pile of metal and it didn't work. But there are actually good reasons to 3D print a rocket. A rocket has four major systems payload, guidance, structural and propulsion. The bulk of the\n The rocket is made up of the propulsion system, including the propellant tanks and the rocket engines. Cryogenic fuel and oxidizer are pumped through an injector into the combustion chamber where they react, releasing an enormous amount of heat. This causes the exhaust\n gases to expand, exiting the rocket nozzle at high velocity. The faster this exit velocity and the higher the mass flow rate, the more thrust that can be generated. So rockets are huge complex engineering projects, which up to this\n point have largely been manufactured using traditional techniques. That means before you can build the rocket, you first have to build the tools to build the rocket. For example, to build NASA's next huge rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS, they first needed to construct\n the Vertical Assembly Center, or VAC. This is a 170-foot tall tool for welding together the domes, rings, and barrel sections of the rocket's fuel tanks.\n In contrast, Relativity Space the company is just 5 and a half years\n old, and they plan to launch their first rocket this year.\n I've always done that with software, these guys are doing it with aerospace hardware.\n This will go to space and it's by far the largest 3D printed product really of any type ever made that's gonna fly. I think maybe of any type in the world. But it still looks 3D printed like you can still see the layers. Yeah, you can still see the layers.\n It only adds an extra 5 to 10 percent of the mass with the roughness. When you actually cross section the material and look at the machined parts of it, it looks like normal metal. Like actually at this end, this is printed as well, we just machined\n it afterwards so it looks like normal metal in the joint sections. Does the surface roughness cause any aerodynamic problems? No, none at all. Yeah, it's actually the exact same aerodynamically. This whole thing we simulate the print before printing.\n Because if you just printed the 3D file and said press print, you would end up with a printer that's warped and material falling all over the place. It wouldn't actually work. So we've invented software that reverse warps the whole part.\n printing it. So the robots are actually doing this really wobbly weird shape but then it is actually perfectly straight within a human hair. As it cools. The warpy thing turns into\n And we simulate all of that. So it's a big computational solver that simulates it. And there's many, many other problems we've had to solve to actually get printing a rocket to work. But it's all these little pieces over the last couple years.\n And we really started to hit some breakthroughs, which is also why now you see a whole rocket. Yeah, you can step up here actually if you want. Can I? Yeah, yeah. Hello!\n looking inside a 3D printed rocket that is actually gonna go to space. Yes. This giant hunk of metal. It's unbelievable. Yeah. There's like rings inside. Those are printed in stiffeners and so those help prevent\n the rocket from buckling and crumpling. So if you had a Coke can and didn't pop the tab, if you try to step on it, it's almost impossible because there's pressure inside that that keeps it from buckling. But then when you pop the tab there's no pressure and you can\n So if you crunch it, super easy, it's not hard at all. So rockets are the same, the 50 psi pressure which is about the same as a car tire keeps it inflated and keeps it from crumpling, but then those stiffeners also help keep it rigid.\n So believe it or not, a rocket tank is thinner versus its diameter than a Coke can. So when you look at a Coke can, you know, how big it is and then how thin it is, a rocket tank is actually thinner than that. So yeah, it's pretty light. It has to be very light. Sure.\n Aerospace companies started using metal 3D printing over a decade ago to construct small complex parts, for example the injector. That is the most important part of any rocket engine where you're basically going to take the liquid propellant and turn it into a fine mist.\n that mixes really rapidly and those have actually been transitioned to 3D printing all over the industry. Traditionally something like this is a rocket engine injector so it mixes liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants together and then\n This is what actually produces all the fire and flame that is in a rocket engine. Traditionally it would be over a thousand individual pieces and it would take nine months, but here we're 3D printing the whole thing in one piece. It takes two weeks and it costs ten times\n One of the big benefits of 3D printing is reducing the number of parts. Have you ever thought about how inside a rocket's combustion chamber, it gets really hot, up to 3500 Kelvin? That's hot enough to melt virtually any metal.\n So how do the combustion chamber and rocket nozzle not melt? Well the answer is they're cooled by passing the cryogenic propellants over them.\n boil iron. On the outside you can freeze stuff to the exterior of this because you're running liquid hydrogen through these things. But to make those you basically had to take thousands of very small pipes\n pipes, and then you would form them into the shape of the combustion chamber and the nozzle, and then you would braze weld them together. And this was a ridiculously labour-intensive task. You would have 1,080 individual pipes running up the side, all\n This is a rocket nozzle being 3D printed, and you can see the channels for the cryogenic propellants being printed\n right into the single part instead of having to add a thousand pipes on the outside. Smaller parts like these are typically 3D printed using metal powder and lasers. So you can see the cooling channels are all being built as the one piece.\n So this is a nozzle. It really just lays down a layer of powder that's about a 20th the thickness of a human hair. So it's really really fine layers just over and over and over and over relentlessly for probably about a week or so.\n and then out comes a rocket nozzle. All printed as one piece. It's way cheaper than traditional. And this has four lasers going at once. That's amazing. I get asked a lot, aren't 3D printed metals not very strong or how can it actually work?\n work, but the printed materials are stronger than they would be built traditionally. Actually, it's counterintuitive. It is. Because we develop our own custom alloys in-house. We have a whole material science team just developing our own alloys for 3D printing.\n And the fact that it melts and then cools and solidifies very, very quickly, you can take advantage of that physics principle to get really strong alloys. Another major benefit of 3D printing is that it allows for rapid iteration. You can build a part\n quickly, test it, and then redesign rapidly and print again.\n we build, we can iterate and make better. So that's the other, you know, and we say software driven manufacturing, that's really what it is. Since you don't have fixed tooling, all the part geometries are just controlled via the CAD model and then the printers just print, you know, direct\n from file essentially. It means you can actually change the design extremely fast. So building a whole engine only takes us about a month. So then a month later you can do a better version and a month later a better version than that. So this particular one will actually be\n I believe one of the first flight engines that's actually launching to orbit on our first rocket. So this tubing not 3D printed right? Not today. Okay. And the future versions we're actually you know integrating that\n into the printed housings and we're going to have a way that that's all printed too.\" Perhaps the biggest impact of the 3D printing approach could be to totally transform what a rocket looks like. With 3D printing, engineers can build parts that would be impractical or impossible with traditional\n techniques. Smooth, curvy, bio-inspired designs are just as easy to print as ordinary structures.\n It's almost done printing, it's going to go out about to here, so it's 16 foot diameter. It's almost like a shell. I was going to say, this reminds me of suddenly we're in The Little Mermaid or something. Yeah, it's just for stiffness though.\n It's not that you plan to make it bio-inspired, it's that structure is actually the optimal structure. We're actually designing many features in the rocket that could not be manufactured unless it was 3D printed, which is one of the secret sauces of\n why you had to build a whole company around it is because our rocket actually looks entirely different 3D printed than it does traditionally. Like in my mind it's been more akin to like gas internal combustion engine to electric, you know, really people are trying to put\n batteries and electric motors into existing products for decades. Like everyone knew electric vehicles were the future, but Nissan and Ford had really not compelling products for a long time. It wasn't until a company came along, you know, called Tesla,\n that decided, well actually the shift to electrification means the batteries, the electric motors, the factory, the design of the product, how we're actually going to scale the company, the supply chain, all of it's different because of electrification. I mean that's in some ways the dirty\n secret of electric cars and why they're able to be automated in production because the part count is so much lower. So for a fully 3D printed rocket we have a hundred times fewer parts which is what we're guiding to. There's no fixed tooling in our factory at all.\n unlike the rest of aerospace that's still really 60 years later, even since Apollo, building products one at a time by hand with hundreds of thousands to millions of individual parts and no one's really changed that paradigm of how an aerospace factory actually works.\n fundamentally works.\n Definitely a big A. Yeah, so our rocket is named Terran 1 and Terran R and then our 3D printer Stargate. So all the things that are relativity are named after Starcraft. So yeah, of course the Stargate printer was\n That's what the Protoss used to warp in space ships, and so that's what's warping in space ships at Relativity. We have a system in our avionics called a pylon that we have to build a lot of, so we always joke we have to construct additional pylons.\n Some people don't know how rockets are built traditionally at all anyway. And I think a lot of people assume it's rockets, so shouldn't it be already very advanced and robots everywhere and, you know, Elon's got SpaceX and Tesla, so it doesn't\n SpaceX just look like Tesla with all these robots and automation, but that's really not true. I mean, aerospace hasn't adopted automation at all. One of the issues, right, is that you're not making a lot of rockets. Right. So there's no incentive to like\n like figure out how to tool up a factory to like pump out rockets like 100 a day or something. Exactly. Like you would for cars. Exactly. You're not making a lot. Even with commercial aircraft, you're not making nearly as many. And there's orders of magnitude more parts and complexity. Commercial aircraft\n has several million individual parts. So to have robots assemble several million parts when a automobile has tens of thousands is completely different. It's a much harder problem. So that's where 3D printing is automation.\n for aerospace because you're not assembling all those parts with robots like you would with a car, you're assembling them in the 3D file and then the printer just prints them assembled. The plan for relativity space, is it\n low-earth orbit or is it going further than that? So for Terran 1 it's mostly low-earth orbit, the first rocket. Terran R can actually send payload to the moon, to Mars, I mean it's pretty, pretty huge. I founded the company because I really thought that there needed to be\n you know, dozens of hundreds of companies making Mars happen. We're focused on taking this 3D printing tech and what we call the factory of the future and one day shrinking it down to something we'll actually launch to Mars and build an industrial base. So that's the long-term vision of the company is build the\n I don't know that in 10, 20 years that you will be 3D printing rockets all the time.\n because if you are flying lots of rockets it becomes cheaper to have a dedicated machine for it. I do think that as a company they are well placed because even if Terran fails to capitalise on the market, even if nobody wants to use it as a launch\n launch vehicle, they are clearly now the world experts on 3D printing rocket hardware because they've done everything, right? They've tried to apply 3D printing to places where a lot of people dismissed it. So I think they're sort of secure as a company, whether we will\n see rockets being 3D printed all the time, that's a good question.\n me to go to space? Yes, I mean certainly what we're doing is lowering the cost so our rockets are costing about five times to you know I believe we can get to ten or even a hundred times cheaper with a fully reusable rocket.\n rocket than what we have today. So it can definitely climb down the cost curve. But I also think, you know, going to Mars and the first people that are going, it really is about what is the point of being a human being. Like for me, why go to Mars?\n if we were having this conversation and a million people were living on another planet, I think it would expand the possibilities of human experience and what it means to be a person. Like we'd have YouTube channels on Mars and people sharing what life on Mars is like.\n versus Earth and there'd be long-distance Amelie, like love story, like I think there's just a lot of richness in what human culture and society can be about. Yes, I think there's criticism about, you know, billionaires going to space and I\n I don't agree with all of the projects need to actually add up to some vision. That is meaningful. I think that's really important. But I do think going to Mars is really just about, you know, we've lived for generations on Earth, so what's it all about?\n Why do we want to keep improving and getting better and furthering society on earth? So for me it's pretty existential what it means to be a human being.\n Hey, this video is sponsored by Omaze, offering you the chance to win a trip to space.

            "transcription": "These are magnetic micro-robots, just millimeters in size. They bend and move in response to applied magnetic fields.\n And with these magnetic fields controlled by a gaming controller, the micro robots can be driven carefully and precisely. They can turn\n by changing the direction of the magnetic field, roll in a rotating field, and even grasp and jump.\n It often feels like you're playing a video game. In some previous work I did, as a demonstration, I was pushing blocks of material around and using a micro-robot like a bulldozer. And the demonstration I did was playing Tetris.\n The idea is this technique could be used to assemble human organ tissues by arranging blocks of different types of cells in particular patterns.\n The way these scientists actually fabricate the micro-robots is pretty ingenious. Tiny rare earth magnets are magnetized in a strong magnetic field. Then they're mixed into a UV resin that will harden when exposed to UV light. The mixture is poured\n into a mold and placed on a stage below which is a rotatable permanent magnet. This creates an adjustable magnetic field to which all the tiny magnets in the resin align. When the desired orientation is reached UV light cures the resin\n in one particular spot, locking those magnets in place. Then the magnetic field can be adjusted and the next section cured. Ultimately, the result is a flexible device with embedded magnets that have different orientations depending on where they are.\n This pattern of orientations is what gives these micro robots their unique behavior in response to magnetic fields.\n With the right magnetic fields, the results can be pretty sophisticated. Watch this micro-robot pick up a block and then roll with it over to a ramp.\n It rolls up the ramp, deposits the block at the top, and then returns to its original position. The idea is that devices like this could be used in medical applications.\n So this could be sending a device into fluid areas in your body or into your gastrointestinal tract, for example, a capsule that you could swallow, which will go passively through your GI tract, have no wires attached, and at the right moment we can activate\n But grippers like these may not be the only magnetic micro-robots invading\n your body. A different research group has pioneered these even smaller peanut-shaped magnetic particles, and under the right magnetic field conditions, they form swarms. The swarm can take on different configurations\n the vortex, where many particles travel together like a school of fish, the chain, where particles line up and travel single file, and the ribbon, where motion is perpendicular to the line of particles. One potential application of\n micro robotic swarms is drug delivery. Each magnetic particle could carry a small amount of drug and be guided toward the intended drug delivery site. So to make a swarm useful for potential biomedical application,\n You'd like to keep the swarm aggregated. You probably will not be able to see single micrometer size particles, but you could see the entire swarm. So you'd like to keep it aggregated so you can move it and keep track. But then going through tight environments, for example,\n And who knows, one day you might\n have swarms of magnetic micro-robots cleaning your teeth. Another group of researchers has used tiny magnetic robots to clear biofilms. Those are communities of bacteria and the protective sugar polymers around them. They typically build\n on medical devices, the insides of pipes, and on teeth. Can I ask, does this idea of magnetic control of micro robots, does it supplant previous concepts? Like I'm trying to conceptualize\n the\n is that it's a very scalable technique. So we can make magnetic micro robots that are single cell size and we can make them that are centimeters in size and the principles behave similarly. It pulls off a lot of the functionality\n to off-board magnetic coils. We can have a big computer sitting there and power supply. So a lot of the hard aspects of driving a robot we can do as traditional science. We can have a big computer, we can have medical imaging hooked up and do all these things\n things off board and then on board we're just transmitting the magnetic field directly to the device and so that's our micro robot is basically then just like the mechanical hand of the robot and the rest of the robot is really sitting on the table beside the patient.\n Hey, this episode of Veritasium is supported by viewers like you on Patreon and by Audible.

The balance tips\n towards the right, towards the hanging heavier ball. But why does this happen? Well, the best way I can think of to explain this is that both balls displace the same amount of water. So they both experience the same upward\n buoyant force which is equal to the weight of the water they displace. That's just Archimedes' principle. But by Newton's third law that means there must be equal and opposite forces down on the water in both beakers. So you would think that both beakers would get\n heavier by this same amount. Now for the hanging ball, the beaker does get heavier by this amount because the buoyant force is now supporting some of the weight that used to be supported by this tension in the string. But it's now reduced and so the beaker actually has more\n weight. But for the ping-pong ball, the downward force on the water is almost entirely counteracted by the upward force of the tension in that string on the bottom of the beaker. And therefore the weight of this beaker only increases by the weight of the ping-pong ball\n itself, whereas for the hanging ball the weight increases by the weight of water it displaces. So obviously this beaker is going to end up being heavier. Now I want to propose an additional experiment. What if instead of tethering the ping-pong ball to the\n of this beaker, I just got a free ping pong ball and submerged it with my finger just barely under the surface of the water. In that case, what do you think would happen when the scale was allowed to rotate? Would it tilt down A, towards the hanging\n acrylic ball or B, down towards the ping pong ball which is now just barely submerged under the water or C, would the balance remain perfectly balanced? So I want you to make your selection, make your prediction by\n leaving a comment starting with either A, B, or C and then giving me your explanation and I'll tally up the votes and let you know the answer next time.\n you"

This is the Hilbert Hotel, and you are the manager.\n Now, it might seem like you could accommodate anyone who ever shows up, but there is a limit. A way to exceed even the infinity of rooms at the Hilbert Hotel. To start, let's say only one person is allowed an\n each room, and all the rooms are full. There are an infinite number of people in an infinite number of rooms. Then someone new shows up, and they want a room. But all the rooms are occupied, so what should you do? Well, let's\n manager might turn them away, but you know about infinity, so you get on the PA and you tell all the guests to move down a room. So the person in room 1 moves to room 2, the one in room 2 moves to room 3, and so on down the line. And now you can put the new guest in\n in room one. If a bus shows up with a hundred people, you know exactly what to do. Just move everyone down a hundred rooms and put the new guests in their vacated rooms. But now say a bus shows up that is infinitely long and it's carrying infinitely many\n You knew what to do with a finite number of people, but what do you do with infinite people? You think about it for a minute and then come up with a plan. You tell each of your existing guests to move to the room with double their room number.\n So the person in room 1 moves to room 2, room 2 moves to room 4, room 3 to room 6, and so on. And now all of the odd numbered rooms are available. And you know there are an infinite number of odd numbers, so you can\n give each person on the infinite bus a unique odd-numbered room. This hotel is really starting to feel like it can fit everybody and that's the beauty of infinity it goes on forever. And then all of a sudden more infinite buses\n buses show up. Not just one or two, but an infinite number of infinite buses. So what can you do? Well, you pull out an infinite spreadsheet, of course. You make a row for each bus, bus 1, bus 2, bus 3, and\n so on, and a row at the top for all the people who are already in the hotel. The columns are for the position each person occupies. So you've got hotel room 1, hotel room 2, hotel room 3, etc. And then bus 1 seat 1, bus 1 seat\n 2, bus 1 seat 3, and so on. So each person gets a unique identifier, which is a combination of their vehicle and their position in it. So how do you assign the rooms? We'll start in the top left corner and draw a line that\n zigzags back and forth across the spreadsheet, going over each unique ID exactly once. Then, imagine you pull on the opposite ends of this line, straightening it out. So we've gone from an infinite-by-infinite\n grid to a single infinite line. It's then pretty simple, just to line up each person on that line with a unique room in the hotel. So everyone fits, no problem. But now, a big bus pulls up.\n infinite party bus with no seats. Instead everyone on board is identified by their unique name, which is kind of strange. So their names all consist of only two letters, A and B, but each name is infinitely\n long. Someone is named ABBAAAAAA and so on forever. Someone else is named ABABABABAB, etc. On this bus, there's a person with every possible infinite sequence of these two\n letters. Now, ABBAAAA, I'll call him ABBA for short, he comes into the hotel to arrange the rooms. But you tell him, sorry, there's no way we can fit all of you in the hotel. And he's like,\n What do you mean? There's an infinite number of us and you have an infinite number of rooms. Why won't this work? So you show them you pull out your infinite spreadsheet again and start assigning rooms to people on the bus so you have room one assign it to ABBA and\n And then room 2 to abababab repeating, and you keep going, putting a different string of As and Bs beside each room number. Now here's the problem, you tell ABBA, let's say we have a complete infinite list. I can still write\n down the name of a person who doesn't yet have a room. The way you do it is you take the first letter of the first name and flip it from an A to a B, then take the second letter of the second name and flip it from a B to an A. And you keep doing this all the way\n down the list, and the name you write down is guaranteed to appear nowhere on that list. Because it won't match the first letter of the first name, or the second letter of the second name, or the third letter of the third name, it will be different from every name\n on the list by at least one character, the letter on the diagonal. The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is infinite, sure, but it is countably infinite, meaning there are as many rooms as there are positive integers\n integers 1 to infinity. By contrast, the number of people on the bus is uncountably infinite. If you try to match up each one with an integer, you will still have people left over. Some infinities are bigger\n than others. So there's a limit to the people that you can fit in the Hilbert Hotel. This is mind-blowing enough, but what's even crazier is that the discovery of different sized infinities sparked a line of\n inquiry that led directly to the invention of the device you're watching this on right now. But that's a story for another time.\n you"

Well consider the case of Israeli fighter pilot training because instructors there found that negative feedback was far superior to positive feedback. If a cadet performed a particular\n So naturally, they concluded that\n positive feedback is ineffective or even detrimental, whereas negative feedback is what works. The problem is, this seems to contradict a body of research that shows positive feedback is actually more effective than negative feedback. For example, in studies involving\n In another study, rugby players were given a video feedback session following a game.\n half of them were shown their highlights and they were praised for what they had done and the other half were shown their biggest blunders, their mistakes and they were scolded for doing things incorrectly. Now a week later at the next game it was the players who had received the positive reinforcement\n who performed the best. And in fact, the difference was not just psychological. Blood tests revealed that the players who received positive feedback actually had higher levels of testosterone than players who had received the negative feedback. I think that's quite remarkable that even a\n week post feedback you could still see a physiological difference between the two types of feedback. Wow. Well, so why didn't this work for the Israeli fighter pilots? Well, maybe there are cultural differences and in some cultures negative feedback\n back\n regardless of the feedback they received. Go with me on this.\n we know that the resulting distribution of scores will have an average of around 50. But just by chance, some students will have scored significantly better or worse than the average. If you select the top 10 students whose scores were all above\n 50 and gave them a second very similar test, you would find that the average of their scores would drop back to around 50. Similarly, if you selected the bottom 10 students, their score on a subsequent test would rise to 50. This is just\n regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is the reason why if you have a really good round of golf today, your round tomorrow will not be as good. Yes! That is because random chance plays a role in virtually everything that we do. So the outcomes of\n of events are influenced by both our skill and a little bit of luck. So if you have especially good luck on one day, chances are your level of luck will not be as good the next day. Now that sounds a little bit like the gambler's fallacy, which\n states that past events influence future probabilities. For example, if you flip a coin and it comes up tails a couple times, the gambler's fallacy is to expect the probability of heads to increase for the next flip. In reality, it doesn't. It's still 50-50. The idea with the gambler's\n fallacy is that probabilities change so that overall things even out in the long run. That's the idea. With regression to the mean, it's not that things are evening out, it's just that extreme events are becoming diluted by the average events which happen much more commonly.\n Now, with these students, they were completely guessing on every question. But even when you know something about the subject, there's still going to be that element of chance. And so regression to the mean always occurs, just to a lesser extent. This is really important to consider in research.\n Imagine you're trialing a new drug to help prevent heart disease. So from a sample of patients, you select those in the bottom 10% of heart health indicators, people with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, that sort of thing. Now after a month of being on the drug, you test them again to find that their scores have\n improved. Well great, the drug is working right? Well maybe not. See the trouble is that although blood pressure and cholesterol are more stable than say your score on a random true or false test, there is still some inherent variability caused by say your level of stress\n on the day, or your recent diet, or even the uncertainties introduced by the measuring apparatus. So the people who ended up in the bottom 10% on the first test likely had these factors all count against them. They were particularly unlucky. But you should not expect them to be as unlucky when\n you test them a second time, so their scores should improve just based on random chance. That is why it is so important that clinical trials use control groups drawn from exactly the same population so that you can see whether the drug improves scores more than random\n chance alone would. Or what about assessing the impact of speed cameras? When they're first installed, they're normally put in locations that have had a high volume of accidents in the previous year or two. Makes sense. Now those accidents are likely due at least in part to bad road design\n but also due at least in part to bad luck. And so you shouldn't be surprised that after a speed camera is installed, the number of accidents goes down. It would go down anyway simply due to regression to the mean.\n somewhere else that previously had a small number of accidents, we'll likely have more. So the overall accident rate may not change, and yet we will feel as though our investment in road safety has paid off. But perhaps what's most troubling about regression\n to the main is how it influences our perception of feedback. For example, with the fighter pilots, after they execute a maneuver particularly poorly, chances are the next attempt is going to be better, regardless of the feedback they receive. Similarly, after\n in a specially successful display, chances are the next attempt is not going to be as good. And that has nothing to do with the feedback and everything to do with the statistical nature of our universe. But we are hardwired to see patterns and causality everywhere.\n Which is why the instructors felt that positive feedback was detrimental and negative feedback is what works. And this is really unfortunate because that is the exact opposite of what well controlled psychological studies show. You know, I think it's really unfortunate that if you\n If you give negative feedback, chances are you'll be rewarded. They will do better. And if you give positive feedback, chances are you'll be disappointed because it's difficult to maintain that level of luck. But that's the way our world is.\n So think about that next time before you tell someone off if you stay positive It may just work out for the best in the long run This video was inspired by the book thinking fast and slow by\n Nobel Prize winning economist Daniel Kahneman. So that was the first time I heard of the Israeli fighter pilot training and really started thinking about regression to the mean. It was pretty awesome and I downloaded this book from Audible so I was listening to it on my travels. I'm currently at the Perumal\n Perimeter Institute, which you can see, has some beautiful blackboards.

            "transcription": "I want you to consider this bet. Here's ten dollars. This could be yours. If I flip this coin in the air, you guys call it in the air. If you're right, I give you the ten dollars. If you're wrong, you give me ten dollars. I saw that coming.\n That's not a good bet for me. I guess in principle I don't agree with the idea of betting. Okay, okay, but what if we just use this as like an allegory for life? You know, it's...\n It's not really about money and betting on a coin. It's more about our approach to risk. Okay, and my approach to risk is obviously a lot less than yours. You wouldn't do this bet. No, no. No, I don't have ten bucks. My gut says don't bet. Why is that?\n Because at the moment I have ten dollars and later I might not. So people are passing up the opportunity to win ten dollars of my money But it kind of makes sense because they have to risk ten dollars of their money, and it's a 50-50 chance So really the bet has been\n zero value.\n leaving it as it is. I'm gonna offer you $15. You only have to put up 10. I'm putting up 15. I'm offering you an extra $5. Why not? I'm not giving my $10 away. What about 20? Is this high?\n I'm going today. $20 that is the top. It's two to one. I just don't like taking that much risk. You don't like risking ten bucks? Sure. I'm valuing my ten dollars, I am. But why don't you value my $20 which you got a 50% chance of right here if you\n accept the bet? Now this doesn't make sense. I've offered people up to $20,\n they're still refusing to take the bet. The bet is objectively in their favor. I mean a 50% chance of winning 20 plus a 50% chance of losing 10 still gives the bet an overall value of $5. Why is it that you won't you won't go\n for this bet? I don't know because I don't want to lose ten dollars just because of that easily. I know but you could win twenty dollars think about the game. I don't know I'm thinking more about what I lose than what I win I think.\n I think that's exactly the point because we feel losses more than we feel gains There's an asymmetry in the way people perceive gains and losses losses are felt much more intensely in fact psychologically most people weight a loss around twice\n prices heavily as a gain. But this varies from person to person.\n This is known as loss aversion. To avoid risking a loss, people will pass up even very favorable bets. But is there a way to overcome our over-sensitivity to losses?\n Let me ask you this, what if I offered to do this 10 times in a row? Same deal, $20 for your 10, flipping this coin. But then I'd be losing $10 each time, wouldn't I? You might be. You'd be risking $10 each time, but you know this is 50-50, and you know that I'm giving you 10 chances.\n Is that a better deal to do it repeatedly? I don't think so. What about a hundred times? It doesn't get better? No. If we played enough and I had enough, you know, of a stake of ten dollars then eventually yes, I would make more money. Yes. Why does repeating the same bat change\n I don't think there's a rational thought behind it. It's just a feeling that one gets when presented with the opportunity. I don't know. I think there is a rational reason behind it. Is it? Yeah. Because the coin is going to be 50-50. You don't know\n know\n it goes your way, you win twice as much as you lose when it goes my way. So the point is, doing it a hundred times, you're basically guaranteed to win money. No, no, no. It's not more chances of winning. It is you are guaranteed to win money. In fact, the expected value of a hundred\n 100 of these bets is a win of $500, and there's only a 1 in 2,300 chance of losing any money at all. So even if you weight losses twice as much as gains, 100 bets is indisputably favorable.\n Here's the thing, how do you accept a hundred of these bets if you won't first accept one of those bets? This experiment is not about gambling. It's not to encourage you to go to the casino where the odds are definitely stacked against you.\n Instead it is a metaphor for all the little risks and opportunities that come our way in our lives. I mean if you view each one as an independent event, you will often say no to even very good bets because you're afraid of the loss.\n So if instead you can see each little bet as one of a series of bets, then you realize that if you take that bet every time, you may win and you may lose, but overall on the aggregate,\n You will come out ahead. Heads. Heads it is. He's just won himself 12 bucks. Woohoo! Tails. The 10 bucks is yours, sir. Thank you, sir. Heads. Thank you very much. The man has won 20 bucks.\n See it pays to take the risk Yes, this is unbelievable my stroke of luck today has been terrible everyone's one-off I'm funding myself. Okay, that's honestly my money. Really? Yeah this video\n is in fact a bit of a risk for me. Because I'm giving out all this money and it's only going to make money on YouTube if like half a million people see it. So if you like this video then you should share it with your friends so that this actually turns out to be a positive bet for me.\n Okay, I'll do that. Share it with your friends. It's Veritasium.

            "transcription": "There is a riddle that is so counterintuitive, it still seems wrong even if you know the answer.\n There are a bunch of YouTube videos about it, but I find all of them either incorrect or incomplete. So in this video, I'm going to dive deeper and explain it fully. Here is the setup.\n Say there are 100 prisoners numbered 1 to 100. Slips of paper containing each of their numbers are randomly placed in 100 boxes in a sealed box.\n room. One at a time, each prisoner is allowed to enter the room and open any 50 of the 100 boxes, searching for their number. Afterwards, they must leave the room exactly as they found it, and they can't communicate in any way with\n the other prisoners. If all 100 prisoners find their own number during their turn in the room, they will all be freed. But if even one of them fails to find their number, they will all be executed. The prisoners are\n allowed to strategize before any of them goes into the room. So what is their best strategy? If they each search for their own number randomly, then each prisoner has a 50% chance of finding it. So the probability that all 100\n prisoners find their numbers is 1 half times 1 half times 1 half 100 times or 1 half to the power of 100. This is equal to point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero 30 zeros and then\n and 8. To put this probability into perspective, two people have a better chance of picking out the same grain of sand from all the beaches and deserts on Earth than by escaping this way.\n But what if I told you that with the right strategy, there's a way to raise their chances to nearly 1 in 3? It improves their odds over random chance by nearly 30 orders of magnitude. That's like taking a millimeter and scaling it up to the diameter of a\n But they can only coordinate this strategy beforehand. Correct. Is this true? Yes. Teach me.\n This is not a trick question. The solution just involves an incredible feature of math. So what is this mathematical strategy? Well, if you don't already know the answer, feel free to pause the video here and try it for yourself.\n And if you don't come up with it, don't worry, you're in good company. Even the person who came up with this riddle, computer scientist Peter Brow-Milterson, he didn't even think of this strategy until a colleague pointed it out.\n where he generously left the solution as an exercise for the reader. So here is the solution. Pretend you are one of the prisoners. When you go into the room, open the box with your number\n on it. The number on the slip inside probably won't be yours, but that's okay. Go to the box with that number on it. Look at the number inside, then go to the box with that number on it, and so on. Keep doing this until you find the slip\n slip with your number. If you find your number, that essentially tells you to go back to the box where you started. It closes the loop of numbers you've been following. But if you've found your number, then you're done. You can stop and leave the room.\n This simple strategy gives over a 30% chance that all the prisoners will find their number. The entire pool has a 30. Everyone can find their number 31% of the time. What?\n But how does it work? The first thing to notice is that all boxes become part of a closed loop. The simplest loop would be a box that contains its own number. If you're prisoner number one and you go to box one, it can\n contains slip 1, then you're done. Your number was part of a loop of 1. But you could also have a loop of 2. Say box 1 points to box 7, and box 7 points back to box 1. Or you could have a loop of 3,\n or 4 or 5 or any length all the way up to 100. The longest loop you could have would connect all the numbers in a single loop. But more generally, any random arrangement of the slips in these boxes will result\n result in a mixture of some shorter and some longer loops. When you start with a box labeled with your number, you are guaranteed to be on the loop that includes your slip. So the thing that determines whether or not you find your slip is\n the length of the loop. If your number is part of a loop that is shorter than 50, then you will definitely find your slip. But if your number is part of a loop that is 51 or longer, you're in trouble. You won't find it before you've exhausted the 50 boxes you're\n allowed to search. When you open the box labeled with your number, you are in fact starting at the farthest point on the loop from your slip. You want to know where is the slip that points to this box, but to find it, you have to follow the loop\n numbers all the way around to the end. That means if the prisoners follow this strategy and the longest loop is 51, not just one or two prisoners will fail to find their number, but all 51 on this loop won't make it. They make it to the\n box just before the box with their slip, but they have to stop searching there. So the probability that all of the prisoners succeed\n Indeed, it's just the probability that a random arrangement of 100 numbers contains no loops longer than 50. Now I promised that this probability would come out to around 1 in 3, but how do we calculate it? Well, imagine writing down all\n the different ways that you could connect a hundred boxes to form a loop of length 100. So you could have box one points to box two, box two points to box three, to box four, and so on all the way to 100.\n and then box 100 would point back to box 1. Or you could have something random, box 5 points to box 99, to box 17, and so on. And let's pick the last one. It's 63.\n and box 63 points back to box 5. So how many different arrangements of these 100 boxes or permutations could you have? Well for the first box I have a hundred different boxes that I could choose from. The second box\n because I've already used one I can only pick from 99 boxes and the next one I can pick from 98 boxes and so on down to the very last box I don't really have a choice there's only one box left I could put in the last\n position. So the total number of different permutations would be 100 times 99 times 98 times 97 all the way down to 1. That is just 100 factorial. There are 100 factorial\n different ways that you could create a loop of a hundred boxes. But what we can't forget is that these are not just lines of numbers, they are loops. So some of these lines\n that look different are actually the same loop. For example, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on up to 100 and then 1 is the same thing as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to 100. You can\n arrange the way you write these numbers a hundred different ways, but they all represent the same loop. So the total number of unique loops of length 100 is 100 factorial divided by\n 100. So what is the probability that any random arrangement of 100 boxes will contain a loop of length 100? Well it's just equal to the number of unique such loops that we just calculated, 100 factorial\n over 100 divided by the total number of ways that you could put 100 slips and 100 boxes which is 100 factorial so the answer is 1 over 100 so there is a 1% chance\n that a random arrangement of slips results in a loop of length 100. And this is a general result. The probability that you get a loop of length 99 is 1 over 99. The probability that you get a loop of length 98 is 1\n 1 over 98. So the probability that there is a loop longer than 50 is 1 over 51 plus 1 over 52 plus 1 over 53, etc. Add all these up and it equals 0.69.\n I still find it difficult to believe.\n And this feels a bit like magic. Using the loop strategy, all the prisoners are more likely to find their numbers than even just two prisoners choosing at random. So, using the loop strategy, what is the probability that each prisoner alone finds\n their number. It is still 50%. Each prisoner can still only open half the boxes, so their individual chance is still one half. But these probabilities are no longer independent of each other.\n Imagine running this experiment a thousand times over. If everyone is guessing randomly, you'd expect that on most runs around 50 prisoners would find their number. On lucky runs, the number would be a bit higher, on unlucky runs a bit lower.\n But using the loop strategy, all of the prisoners would find their numbers 31% of the time, and 69% of the time, fewer than 50 find their number. The prisoners all win together, or the majority\n loses together. That's how this strategy works.\n Now the big question everyone\n asks is, how do you know that if you start with the box with your number on it, you are guaranteed to be on the loop that contains your slip? Well, if you think about it, the slip that says 73, if anyone\n that they will definitely go to the box with the number 73. So the slip and box with the same number essentially form a unit. They're like a little Lego brick and then every slip is a\n hidden inside another box. So as I start laying out slips and boxes randomly, you can see that there's no way that we can end up with a dead end. It's not like you can just get to a box and then stop, because\n Every box contains a slip and that points at another box. So the only way for you to see only boxes when you walk into the room is for every slip to be contained within a box.\n And that necessarily will mean that we are forming loops. So when I start with box 73, I must eventually find slip 73 because then and only then will I be directed to go back to box 73\n Now, what if there is a sympathetic prison guard who\n sneaks into the room before any of the prisoners go in, well then they can guarantee success for the prisoners by swapping the contents of just two boxes. That's because there can be at most one loop that is longer than 50.\n And you can break it in half just by swapping the contents of two boxes. And now I have two separate loops that are each shorter than 50. But what if there was a malicious guard who figured out that\n the prisoners were going to use this loop strategy? Well then they could put the numbers in boxes to ensure they formed a loop longer than 50. In this case, are the prisoners doomed? Surprisingly, no. They can counter by our\n arbitrarily renumbering the boxes. They could, for example, add 5 to each box number. The loops are set both by the locations of the slips and by the box numbers. Renumbering the boxes is essentially\n essentially the same as redistributing the slips. So the problem is back to a random arrangement of loops, meaning the prisoners are back to their 31% chance of survival. Now, what happens if you increase the number of prisoners?\n Fun fact, nobody knows if as you have more and more prisoners it's going towards a limit or if it will eventually go down to zero or what. That is my friend Matt Parker, and I think what he meant to say is we know exactly what happens as you increase\n increase the number of prisoners. With a thousand prisoners, each allowed to check 500 boxes, you might expect their chance of success to drop dramatically. But you can calculate it like we did before, and it comes out to 30.74%.\n only half a percentage point lower than for 100 prisoners. For 1 million prisoners, their probability of success is 30.685%, which is only a little higher than for 1 billion. Of course, their bigger problem would be the time it takes to\n So, your probability of winning this game does indeed approach a limit. So, what is that limit? The formula we've been using is 1 minus the chance of failure, which is the series 1 over 2.\n We can depict this series as the sum of areas of rectangles. There is a curve that follows the heights of these blocks.\n 1 over x. The area under that curve from 50 to 100 approximates the area of all the rectangles. And as the number of prisoners goes to infinity, it becomes a better and better approximation. So to\n To find the probability of failure, we can just take the integral of 1 over x from n to 2n, and we find that it's equal to the natural logarithm of 2. This gives a probability of success of 1 minus the natural log of 2,\n which is about 30.7%.\n The beauty of the loop strategy is linking everyone's\n outcomes together. Instead of each prisoner walking in with their own 50-50 shot, following the same loops means that they have the exact same chance of finding their number as everyone else in their loop. And once the boxes and slips are arranged, that chance is set at either\n 100% or 0%. With this strategy, you can't ever get close to winning with only a few people missing their numbers. You can only fail hard or succeed completely.\n Now if you like solving puzzles even outside of life-threatening prison situations, well you'll love Brilliant, the sponsor of this video.

            "transcription": "There is a hole at the bottom of math. A hole that means we will never know everything with certainty. There will always be true statements that cannot be proven.\n knows what those statements are exactly, but they could be something like the twin-prime conjecture. Twin primes are prime numbers that are separated by just one number, like 11 and 13, or 17 and 19. As you go up the number line,\n The twin primes occur less frequently, and twin primes are rarer still. But the twin prime conjecture is that there are infinitely many twin primes, you never run out. As of right now, no one has proven this conjecture true or false.\n or false. But the crazy thing is this. We may never know. Because what has been proven is that in any system of mathematics where you can do basic arithmetic, there will always be true statements that\n are impossible to prove. That is life.\n 2020 from COVID-19. Conway's Game of Life is played on an infinite grid of square cells, each of which is either live or dead, and there are only two rules. One, any dead cell\n with exactly three neighbors comes to life, and two, any living cell with less than two or more than three neighbors dies. Once you've set up the initial arrangement of cells, the two rules are applied to create the next generation.\n And then the one after that and the one after that and so on. It's totally automatic. Conway called it a zero player game. But even though the rules are simple, the game itself can generate a wide variety of behavior. Some patterns\n Some patterns are stable once they arise, they never change. Others oscillate back and forth in a loop. A few can travel across the grid forever, like this glider here. Many patterns just fizzle out.\n But a few keep growing forever. They keep generating new cells. Now you would think that given the simple rules of the game, you could just look at any pattern\n and determine what will happen to it? Will it eventually reach a steady state? Or will it keep growing without limit? But it turns out, this question is impossible to answer. The ultimate fate of a pattern in Conway's Game of Life\n is undecidable, meaning there is no possible algorithm that is guaranteed to answer the question in a finite amount of time. You could always just try running the pattern and see what happens. I mean, the rules of the game are a kind of algorithm after all.\n But that's not guaranteed to give you an answer either, because even if you run it for a million generations, you won't be able to say whether it'll last forever, or just two million generations, or a billion, or a Googleplex. Is there something\n special about the game of life that makes it undecidable? Nope. There are actually a huge number of systems that are undecidable. Like Wang tiles, quantum physics, airline ticketing systems, and even\n Magic the Gathering. To understand how undecidability shows up in all of these places, we have to go back 150 years to a full-blown revolt in mathematics.\n In 1874, Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, published a paper that launched a new branch of mathematics called set theory. A set is just a well-defined collection of things. So the two shoes on your feet are a set,\n as are all the planetariums in the world. There's a set with nothing in it, the empty set, and a set with everything in it. Now Cantor was thinking about sets of numbers, like natural numbers, positive integers like 1, 2, 3, 4,\n and so on, and real numbers, which include fractions like a third, five halves, and also irrational numbers like pi, e, and the square root of two. Basically, any number that can be represented as an infinite decimal.\n He wondered, are there more natural numbers? Or more real numbers between 0 and 1? The answer might seem obvious. There are an infinite number of each, so both sets should be the same size.\n But to check this logic, Cantor imagined writing down an infinite list, matching up each natural number on one side with a real number between 0 and 1 on the other. Now since each real number is an infinite decimal, there is no first one, so we can just\n write them down in any random order. The key is to make sure we get them all with no duplicates and line them up one to one with an integer. If we can do that with none left over, well then we know that the set of natural numbers and the set of\n real numbers between 0 and 1 are the same size. So assume we've done that. We have a complete infinite list with each integer acting like an index number, a unique identifier for each real number on the list.\n Now, canter says, start writing down a new real number. And the way we're going to do it is by taking the first digit of the first number and adding one. And then take the second digit of the second number and again add one. Take the third\n third digit of the third number, add 1, and keep doing this all the way down the list. If the digit is a 9, just roll it back to an 8. And by the end of this process, you'll have a real number between 0 and 1. But here's the thing.\n This number won't appear anywhere on our list. It's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place, and so on down the line. It has to be different from every number on the list by at least one decimal.\n digit, the number on the diagonal. That's why this is called Cantor's diagonalization proof. It shows there must be more real numbers between 0 and 1 than there are natural numbers extending out\n to infinity. So not all infinities are the same size. Cantor called these countable and uncountable infinities respectively, and in fact there are many more uncountable infinities which are even larger. Now Cantor\n Pantor's work was just the latest blow to mathematics. For 2,000 years, Euclid's elements were considered the bedrock of the discipline. But at the turn of the 19th century, Lobachevsky and Gauss discovered non-Euclidean geometries, and this prompted mathematicians to\n examine more closely the foundations of their field. And they did not like what they saw. The idea of a limit at the heart of calculus turned out to be poorly defined. And now Cantor was showing that infinity itself was much more complex than\n than anyone had imagined. In all this upheaval, mathematics fractured and a huge debate broke out among mathematicians at the end of the 1800s. On the one side were the intuitionists who thought that Cantor's work was nonsense. They were convinced\n that math was a pure creation of the human mind and that infinities like Cantor's weren't real. Henri Poincar\u00e9 said that later generations will regard set theory as a disease from which one has recovered. Leopold Kronecker\n called Cantor a scientific charlatan and a corruptor of the youth, and he worked to keep Cantor from getting a job he wanted. On the other side were the formalists. They thought that math could be put on absolutely secure logical foundations through\n The informal leader of the formalists was the German mathematician David Hilbert. Hilbert was a living legend, a hugely influential mathematician who had worked in nearly every area of mathematics. He almost beat Einstein to the point of being a genius.\n He developed entirely new mathematical concepts that were crucial for quantum mechanics, and he knew that Cantor's work was brilliant. Hilbert was convinced that a more formal and rigorous system of mathematical proof based on set theory\n could solve all the issues that had cropped up in math over the last century, and most other mathematicians agreed with him. But in 1901, Bertrand Russell pointed out\n serious problem in Cantor's set theory. Russell knew that if sets can contain anything, they can contain other sets, or even themselves. For example, the set of all sets must contain itself, as does the set of sets with more than five elements\n in them. You could even talk about the set of all sets that contain themselves. But this leads straight to a problem. What about R, the set of all sets that don't contain themselves? If R doesn't contain itself,\n Well, then it must contain itself. But if R does contain itself, then by definition, it must not contain itself. So R contains itself if and only if it doesn't. Russell had found another paradox of self-reference.\n And he later explained his paradox using a hairy analogy. Let's say there's a village populated entirely by grown men with a strange law against beards. Specifically, the law states that the village barber must shave all and only those men of the village.\n who do not shave themselves. But the barber himself lives in the village too, of course, and he's a man, so who shaves him? If he doesn't shave himself, then the barber has to shave him. But the barber can't shave himself\n himself, because the barber doesn't shave anyone who shaves themselves, so the barber must shave himself if and only if he doesn't shave himself. It's a contradiction. The intuitionists rejoiced at Russell's paradox, thinking it had proved\n set theory hopelessly flawed. But Zermelo and other mathematicians from Hilbert School solved the problem by restricting the concept of a set. So the collection of all sets, for example, is not a set anymore. And neither is the collection of all sets which don't\n This eliminated the paradoxes that come with self-reference. Hilbert and the formalists lived to fight another day, but self-reference refused to die quite that easily. Fast forward to the 1970s.\n 60s, and mathematician Hao Wang was looking at square tiles with different colors on each side, like these. The rules were that touching edges must be the same color, and you can't rotate or reflect tiles, only slide them around. The question was, if you're\n given an arbitrary set of these tiles, can you tell if they will tile the plane? That is, will they connect up with no gaps all the way out to infinity? It turns out, you can't tell for an arbitrary set of tiles whether they will tile the\n plain or not. The problem is undecidable. Just like the fate of a pattern in Conway's Game of Life. In fact, it's exactly the same problem. And that problem, ultimately, comes from self-reference.\n Hilbert and the formalists were about to discover. Hilbert wanted to secure the foundations of mathematics by developing a new system for mathematical proofs. Systems of proof were an old idea going back to the ancient Greeks. A system of proof starts with\n axioms, basic statements that are assumed to be true, like a straight line can be drawn between any two points. Proofs are then constructed from those axioms using rules of inference, methods for using existing statements to derive new statements, and\n are chosen to preserve truth. If the existing statements are true, then so are the new ones. Hilbert wanted a formal system of proof, a symbolic logical language with a rigid set of manipulation rules for those symbols. Logical and mathematical statements\n and no human is immortal would be expressed like this. Hilbert and the formalists wanted to express the idea of a human being.\n So Russell, along with Alfred North Whitehead, developed a formal system like this in their three-volume\n Principia Mathematica, published in 1913. Principia Mathematica is vast, a total of nearly 2,000 pages of dense mathematical notation. It takes 762 pages just to get to a complete\n proof that 1 plus 1 equals 2, at which point Russell and Whitehead dryly note the above proposition is occasionally useful. The authors had originally planned a fourth volume, but unsurprisingly they were too worn out to\n complete it. So yes, the notation is dense and exhausting, but it is also exact, unlike ordinary languages. It leaves no room for errors or fuzzy logic to creep in. And most importantly,\n It allows you to prove properties of the formal system itself. There were three big questions that Hilbert wanted answered about mathematics. Number one, is math complete? Meaning, is there\n way to prove every true statement. Does every true statement have a proof? Number two, is mathematics consistent? Meaning, is it free of contradictions? I mean, if you can simultaneously prove A and\n not a, then that's a real problem because you can prove anything at all. And number three, is math decidable? Meaning, is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms?\n Now, Hilbert was convinced that the answers to all three of these questions was yes. At a major conference in 1930, Hilbert gave a fiery speech about these questions. He ended it with a line that summed up his former\n In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus, which means we will not know, our slogan shall be, we must know, we will know. These words are literally on his grave.\n But by the time Hilbert gave this speech, his dream was already crumbling. Just the day before, at a small meeting at the same conference, a 24-year-old logician named Kurt G\u00f6del explained that he had found the answer to the first of Hilbert's three\n questions about completeness, and the answer was no. A complete, formal system of mathematics was impossible. The only person who paid much attention was John von Neumann, one of Hilbert's former students, who pulled G\u00f6del aside to ask a few\n questions. But the next year, Goodall published a proof of his incompleteness theorem, and this time everyone, including Hilbert, took notice. This is how Goodall\n Goodall wanted to use logic and mathematics to answer questions about the very system of logic and mathematics. And so he took all these basic symbols\n of a mathematical system and then he gave each one a number. This is known as the symbol's Goodall number. So the symbol for naught gets the number 1 or has the good\n good'll number 2, if then is good'll number 3. Now if you're expressing all of these symbols with numbers, then what do you do about the numbers themselves? Well, 0 gets its own good'll number 6, and if you want to write a 1,\n just put this successor symbol next to it. The immediate successor of 0 is 1, and if you want to write 2, then you have to write SS0, and that represents 2, and so on. So you could represent any positive integer\n this way. Granted it is cumbersome, but it works, and that is the point of this system. So now that we have good old numbers for all of the basic symbols and all of the numbers we might want to use, we can start to write equations. Like we\n could write 0 equals 0. So these symbols have the good old numbers 6 5 6 and we can actually create a new card that represents this\n equation, zero equals zero. And the way we do it is we take the prime numbers, starting at two, and we raise each one to the power of the goodle number of the symbol in our equation. So we have two to the power of six,\n times 3 to the power of 5, times 5 to the power of 6 equals 243 million. So 243 million is the good old number of the whole equation 0 equals 0.\n We can write down good old numbers for any set of symbols that you can imagine. So really this is an infinite deck of cards where any set of symbols that you want to write down in a sequence you can represent with\n a unique goodle number and the beauty of this goodle number is you can do a prime factorization of it and you can work out exactly what symbols made up this card. So in this whole pack of cards there are going to\n be true statements and there are going to be false statements. So how do you prove that something is true? Well you need to go to the axioms. The axioms also have their own good old numbers which are formed in the same way.\n So here's an axiom which says not the successor of any number x equals zero Which makes sense because in this system there are no negative numbers and so the successor of any number cannot be zero\n So we can put down this axiom and then we can substitute in 0 for x, saying that 1 does not equal 0, and we've created a proof, this is the simplest proof I can think of, that\n shows that 1 does not equal 0. Now this card, for the proof of 1 does not equal 0, gets its own goodle number. And the way we calculate this goodle number is just as before, we take the prime numbers and we raise 2\n to the power of the axiom times 3 to the power of 1 does not equal 0 and we get a tremendously large number it would have 73 million digits if you calculated it all out so I've just left\n left it here in exponential notation. As you can see these numbers get very large and so you might want to start just calling them by letters. So we could say this one is good old number A, this is good old number B, good old number\n number C and so on. Goodell goes to all this trouble to find this card, which says there is no proof for the statement with Goodell number G.\n trick is that the good old number of this card is G. So what this statement is really saying is this card is unprovable. There is no proof anywhere in our infinite deck for this\n card. Now think about it, if it's false and there is a proof, then what you have just proven is there is no proof. So you're stuck with a contradiction. That would mean that\n mathematical system is inconsistent. The other alternative is that this card is true. There is no proof of the statement with good old number G, but that means this mathematical system has true statements in\n that have no proof. So your mathematical system is incomplete. And that is Goodell's incompleteness theorem. This is how he shows that any basic mathematical system that can do fundamental arithmetic\n There's a line in the TV show The Office that echoes the self-referential paradox of Goodall's proof.\n But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So Jim is actually my friend. But because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So actually,\n Goodell's incompleteness theorem means that truth and provability are not at all the same thing.\n was wrong. There will always be true statements about mathematics that just cannot be proven. Now Hilbert could console himself with the hope that at least we could still prove maths consistent, that is free of contradictions, but then Goodall published his second\n incompleteness theorem in which he showed that any consistent formal system of math cannot prove its own consistency. So taken together, Goodell's two incompleteness theorems say that the best you can hope for is a consistent yet\n incomplete system of math, but a system like that cannot prove its own consistency. So some contradiction could always crop up in the future, revealing that the system you'd been working with had been inconsistent the whole time. And that leaves only the third\n And the third and final big question from Hilbert is mathematics decidable? That is, is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms? And in 1936, Alan Turing found a way to settle this question.\n In his time, computers weren't machines, they were people, often women who carried out long and tedious calculations. Turing imagined an entirely mechanical computer.\n He wanted it to be powerful enough to perform any computation imaginable, but simple enough that you could reason through its operation. So he came up with a machine that takes as input an infinitely long tape of square cells, each containing a number of cells.\n containing a zero or a one. The machine has a read-write head that can read one digit at a time, and then it can perform one of only a few tasks. Overwrite a new value, move left, move right,\n simply halt. Halting means the program has run to completion. Now the program consists of a set of internal instructions. You can think of it like a flowchart that tells the machine what to do based on the digit it reads and its\n its internal state. You could imagine exporting these instructions to any other Turing machine, which would then perform in exactly the same way as the first. Although this sounds simple, a Turing machine's arbitrarily large memory and\n program mean it can execute any computable algorithm if given enough time, from addition and subtraction to the entire YouTube algorithm. That's what made the Turing machine\n So, what's so useful in answering Hilbert's question on decidability? When a Turing machine halts, the program has finished running and the tape is the output. But sometimes a Turing machine never halts, maybe it gets stuck in an infinite loop.\n to tell beforehand if a program will halt or not on a particular input. Turing realized this halting problem was very similar to the decidability problem. If you could find a way to figure out if a Turing machine would halt, then it would also be possible to\n If a statement followed from the axioms. For example, you could solve the twin prime conjecture by writing a Turing machine program that starts with the axioms and constructs all theorems that can be produced in one step using the rules of inference. Then it\n constructs all theorems that can be produced in one step from those and so on. Each time it generates a new theorem, it checks if it's the twin-prime conjecture, and if it is, it halts. If not, it never halts. So if you could solve the halting problem,\n You could solve the twin-prime conjecture and all sorts of other unsolved questions. So Turing said, let's assume we can make a machine H that can determine whether any Turing machine will halt or not on a particular input. You insert the\n program and its input, and H simulates what will happen, printing out either HALTS or never HALTS. For now, we don't worry about how H works, we just know that it always works, it always gives you the right answer.\n Now, we can modify the H machine by adding additional components. One, if it receives the output HALTS, immediately goes into an infinite loop. Another, if it receives NEVER HALTS, then it immediately HALTS.\n We can call this entire new machine H+, and we can export the program for that entire machine. Now, what happens if we give this machine its own code both as\n program and input. Well now, H is simulating what H plus would do given its own input. Essentially, H has to determine the behavior of a machine that it itself is a part of.\n in this exact circumstance. If H concludes that H plus never halts, well, this makes H plus immediately halt. If H thinks H\n H plus will halt, then that necessarily forces H plus to loop. Whatever output the halting machine H gives, it turns out to be wrong.\n There's a contradiction. The only explanation can be that a machine like H can't exist. There's no way to tell in general if a Turing machine will halt or not on a given input. And this means\n mathematics is undecidable. There is no algorithm that can always determine whether a statement is derivable from the axioms. So something like the twin prime conjecture might be unsolvable. We might never know whether there\n are infinite twin primes or not?\n its first excited state. This is known as the spectral gap. Some systems have a significant spectral gap, whereas others are gapless. There are a continuum of energy levels all the way down to the ground state. And this is important because\n at low temperatures, gapless quantum systems can undergo phase transitions, while gapped systems cannot. They don't have the energy needed to overcome the spectral gap. But figuring out if a system is gapped or gapless has long been known\n to be a very difficult problem. Only recently, in 2015, did mathematicians prove that in general the spectral gap question is undecidable. To quote the authors, even a perfect\n complete description of the microscopic interactions between the materials particles is not always enough to deduce its macroscopic properties. Now remember that Turing designed his machines to be as powerful computers as it is possible to make.\n To this day, the best computational systems are those that can do everything a Turing machine can. This is called Turing completeness, and it turns out there are many such Turing complete systems. Although they are powerful,\n Every Turing complete system comes with a catch, its own analog of the halting problem, some undecidable property of the system. Wang tiles are Turing complete, their halting problem is whether or not they'll tile the plane.\n quantum systems are Turing complete, and their halting problem is the spectral gap question. And the game of life is Turing complete, its halting problem is literally whether or not it halts. There are many more examples of this, like airline\n ticketing systems, Magic the Gathering, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spreadsheets. Nearly every programming language in existence is designed to be Turing complete. But in theory, we only need one programming language, because you can program anything at all using\n any Turing Complete system. So here's a Turing Machine inside the Game of Life. And since the Game of Life is itself Turing Complete, it\n should be capable of simulating itself, and indeed it is. This is the game of life.\n on the game of life. The real legacy of David Hilbert's dream is all of our modern computational devices.\n Kurt Goodall suffered bouts of mental instability later in life. Convinced that people were trying to poison him, he refused to eat, eventually starving himself to death.\n 1943. His epitaph was his slogan from 1930. We must know, we will know. The truth is, we don't know. Sometimes we can't know. But in trying to find out,\n We can discover new things, things that change the world. Alan Turing put his ideas about computing to practical use in World War II, leading the team at Bletchley Park that built real calculating machines to crack Nazi codes for the Allies.\n After one estimate, the intelligence Turing and his colleagues gathered from decrypted messages shortened the war by two to four years. After the war, Turing and John von Neumann designed the first true programmable electronic computer, ENIAC, based on\n Turing's designs. But Turing didn't live to see his ideas develop much further. In 1952, the British government convicted him of gross indecency upon learning he was gay. He was stripped of his security clearance and forced to take hormones.\n In 1954, he committed suicide.\n But Turing's ideas about computability came from his concept of the Turing machine, which came from thinking about Hilbert's question, is math decidable? So Turing's code-breaking machines and indeed all modern computers are all computer-based.\n computers stem from the weird paradoxes that arise from self-reference.\n be true statements that cannot be proven. And you might think this realization would have driven mathematicians mad and led to the disintegration of the entire mathematical enterprise. But instead, thinking about this problem transformed the concept of\n of infinity, changed the course of a world war, and led directly to the invention of the device you're watching this on right now.\n Hey, this video was sponsored by Brilliant, a website full of interactive courses and quizzes that delve deep into topics like math, physics, and computer science.

            "transcription": "Mathematics began as a way to quantify our world, to measure land, predict the motions of planets, and keep track of commerce. Then came a problem considered impossible. The secret to solving it was to separate math from the real\n world, to split algebra from geometry, and to invent new numbers so fanciful they are called imaginary. Ironically, 400 years later, these very numbers turn up in the heart of our best physical theory of the universe.\n Only by abandoning maths connection to reality could we discover reality's true nature. In 1494, Luca Pacioli, who is Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, publishes Summa\n Arithmetica, a comprehensive summary of all mathematics known in Renaissance Italy at the time. In it, there is a section on the cubic, any equation which today we would write as ax cubed plus bx squared plus cx plus d equals zero.\n People have been trying to find a general solution to the cubic for at least 4,000 years. But each ancient civilization that encountered it, the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians, they all came up empty-handed.\n Paceoli's conclusion is that a solution to the cubic equation is impossible. Now this should be at least a little surprising since without the x cubed term the equation is simply a quadratic and many ancient civilizations had solved\n quadratics thousands of years earlier. Today, anyone who's passed 8th grade knows the general solution. It's minus b plus minus root b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. But most people just plug and chug into this formula completely\n oblivious to the geometry that ancient mathematicians used to derive it. You know, back in those days, mathematics wasn't written down in equations, it was written with words and pictures. Take for example the equation x squared\n plus 26x equals 27. Ancient mathematicians would think of the x squared term like a literal square with sides of length x and then 26x well that would be a rectangle with\n one side of length 26 and the other side of length x and these two areas together add to 27. So how do we figure out what x is? Well we can take this 26x rectangle\n and cut it in half. So now I have two 13x rectangles and I can position them so the new shape I create is almost a square. It's just missing this section down here. But I know the\n dimensions of this section, it's just 13 by 13. So I can complete the square by adding in a 13 by 13 square. Now since I've added 13 squared or 169 to the left\n hand side of the equation I also have to add 169 to the right hand side of the equation to maintain the equality. So now I have this larger square with sides of length x plus 13 and it is equal to a hundred and ninety\n Now the square root of 196 is 14, so I know that the sides of this square have length 14, which means x is equal to 1. Now this is a great visual way to\n solve a quadratic equation, but it isn't complete. I mean if you look at our original equation x equals 1 is a solution, but so is negative 27. For thousands of years, math\n But mathematicians were oblivious to the negative solutions to their equations because they were dealing with things in the real world, lengths and areas and volumes. I mean, what would it mean to have a square with sides of length negative 27 that just\n doesn't make any sense. So for those mathematicians, negative numbers didn't exist. You could subtract, that is find the difference between two positive quantities, but you couldn't have a negative answer or negative coefficients. Mathematicians were so averse\n to negative numbers, that there was no single quadratic equation. Instead, there were six different versions arranged so that the coefficients were always positive. The same approach was taken with the cubic. In the 11th century, Persian\n mathematician Omar Khayyam identified 19 different cubic equations, again keeping all coefficients positive. He found numerical solutions to some of them by considering the intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles, but he fell short\n of his ultimate goal, a general solution to the cubic. He wrote, maybe one of those who will come after us will succeed in finding it. 400 years later and 4,000 kilometers away, the solution begins to take shape.\n Scipione del Faro is a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna. Sometime around 1510, he finds a method to reliably solve depressed cubics. These are a subset of cubic equations with no x squared\n So what does he do after solving a problem that has stumped mathematicians for millennia? When considered impossible by Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, he tells no one. See, being a mathematician in the 1500s,\n is hard. Your job is constantly under threat from other mathematicians who can show up at any time and challenge you for your position. You can think of it like a math duel. Each participant submits a set of questions to the other and the person who\n solves the most questions correctly gets the job, while the loser suffers public humiliation. As far as Delferro knows, no one else in the world can solve the depressed cubic, so by keeping his solution secret, he\n Fior is not as talented a mathematician as he is a mathematician.\n mathematician as his mentor, but he is young and ambitious. After Delferro's death, he boasts about his own mathematical prowess, and specifically, his ability to solve the depressed cubic. On February 12, 1535, Fiori challenges mathematician\n Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia, who has recently moved to Fiora's hometown of Venice. Niccolo Fontana is no stranger to adversity. As a kid, his face was cut open by a French soldier, leaving him with a stutter. That's why\n he's known as Tartaglia, which means stutterer in Italian. Growing up in poverty, Tartaglia is largely self-taught. He claws his way up through Italian society to become a respected mathematician. Now, all of that is at stake.\n As is the custom, in the challenge, Tartaglia gives a varied assortment of 30 problems to Fior. Fior gives 30 problems to Tartaglia, all of which are depressed cubics. Each mathematician has 40 days to solve\n the 30 problems they've been given, Fior can't solve a single problem. Tartaglia solves all 30 of Fior's depressed cubics in just two hours. It seems Fior's boastfulness was his undoing.\n Before the challenge came, Tartaglia learns of Fior's claim to have solved the depressed cubic, but he's skeptical. But word was that a great mathematician had revealed the secret to Fior, which\n seems more plausible. So with the knowledge that a solution to the cubic is possible, and with his livelihood on the line, Tartaglia sets about solving the depressed cubic himself. To do it, he extends the idea of completing the square\n into three dimensions. Take the equation x cubed plus 9x equals 26. You can think of x cubed as the volume of a cube with sides of length x, and if you add a volume of 9x you get 26.\n So, just like with completing the square, we need to add onto the cube to increase its volume by 9x. Imagine extending three sides of this cube out a distance y, creating a new larger cube with sides of\n length, call it z. z is just x plus y. The original cube has been padded out, and we can break up the additional volume into seven shapes. There are three rectangular prisms with dimensions of x by\n x by y, and another three narrower prisms with dimensions of x by y by y. Plus there's a cube with a volume y cubed. Tertaglia rearranges the six rectangular prisms into one block, one\n side has length 3y, the other has a length x plus y which is z, and the height is x. So the volume of this shape is its base 3yz times its height x. And Tertaglia realizes this volume can\n perfectly represent the 9x term in the equation if its base is equal to 9. So he sets 3yz equals 9. Putting the cube back together, you find we're missing the one small y cubed block, so we can\n Then complete the cube by adding y cubed to both sides of the equation. Now we have z cubed, the complete larger cube, equals 26 plus y cubed. We have two equations and two unknowns. Solving the first equation\n for z and substituting into the second, we get y to the 6 plus 26y cubed equals 27. At first glance, it seems like we're now worse off than when we started. The variable is now raised to the power of 6 instead of just 3. However,\n However, if you think of y cubed as a new variable, the equation is actually a quadratic. The same quadratic that we solved by completing the square. So we know y cubed equals 1, which means y equals 1.\n equals 3 over y, so z is 3. And since x plus y equals z, x must be equal to 2. Which is indeed a solution to the original equation. And with that, Tartaglia becomes the second human on the planet\n to solve the depressed cubic. To save himself the work of going through the geometry for each new cubic he encounters, Tertullia summarizes his method in an algorithm, a set of instructions. He writes this down not as a set of equations like we would today,\n modern algebraic notation wouldn't exist for another hundred years, but instead as a poem. Tertullia's victory makes him something of a celebrity. Mathematicians are desperate to learn how he solved the cubic, especially in\n Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath based in Milan. As you can guess, Tartaglia will have none of it. He refuses to reveal even a single question from the competition. But Cardano is persistent. He writes a series of letters that alternate between\n flattery and aggressive attacks. Eventually, with the promise of an introduction to his wealthy benefactor, Cardano manages to lure Tartaglia to Milan. And there, on March 25th, 1539, Tartaglia reveals his method.\n but only after forcing Cardano to swear a solemn oath not to tell anyone the method, not to publish it, and to write it only in cipher, quote, so that after my death, no one shall be able to understand it.\n Cardano is delighted and immediately starts playing around with Tartaglia's algorithm. But he has a loftier goal in mind, a solution to the full cubic equation including the x squared term. And amazingly, he discovers it. If you\n substitute for x, x minus b over 3a, then all the x squared terms cancel out. This is the way to turn any general cubic equation into a depressed cubic, which can then be solved by Tartaglia's formula.\n Cardano is so excited to have solved the problem that stumped the best mathematicians for thousands of years, he wants to publish it. Unlike his peers, Cardano has no need to keep the solution a secret. He makes his living not as a mathematician, but as a physician and\n famous intellectual. For him, the credit is more valuable than the secret. The only problem is the oath he swore to Tartaglia who won't let him break it. And you might think this would be the end of it, but in\n In 1542, Cardano travels to Bologna and there he visits a mathematician who just happens to be the son-in-law of one Scipione del Ferro, the man who, on his deathbed, gave the solution to the depressed cubic to Antonio Fior.\n finds this solution in Delferro's old notebook, which is shared with him during the visit. This solution predates Tartaglia's by decades. So now, as Cardano sees it, he can publish the full solution to the cubic without violating his oath to Tartaglia.\n Three years later, Cardano publishes Ars Magna, The Great Art, an updated compendium of mathematics. Written in five years, may it last for 500. Cardano writes a chapter with a unique geometric proof for each of the thirteen chapters.\n arrangements of the cubic equation. Although he acknowledges the contributions of Tartaglia, Delferro, and Fior, Tartaglia is displeased to say the least. He writes insulting letters to Cardano and CCs a good fraction of the mathematics community.\n And he has a point. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often called Cardano's method. But Ars Magna is a phenomenal achievement. It pushes geometrical reasoning to its very breaking point. Literally.\n While Cardano is writing Ars Magna, he comes across some cubic equations that can't easily be solved in the usual way, like x cubed equals 15x plus 4. Plugging this into the algorithm yields a solution that contains\n Cardano asks Tartaglia about the case, but he evades and implies Cardano is just not clever enough to use his formula properly. The reality is, Tartaglia has no idea what to do either.\n Cardano walks back through the geometric derivation of a similar problem to see exactly what goes wrong. While the 3D cube slicing and rearrangement works just fine, the final quadratic completing the square step leads to a geometric\n paradox. Cardano finds part of a square that must have an area of 30, but also sides of length 5. Since the full square has an area of 25, to complete the square Cardano has to somehow add\n Now this isn't the first time square roots of negatives show up in mathematics. In fact, earlier in R's magna is this problem.\n Find two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40. You can combine these equations into the quadratic x squared plus 40 equals 10x. But if you plug this into the quadratic formula, the solutions contain the square root of\n roots of negatives. The obvious conclusion is that a solution doesn't exist, which you can verify by looking at the original problem. There are no two real numbers which add to 10 and multiply to 40. So, mathematicians\n You understood square roots of negative numbers were math's way of telling you there is no solution. But this cubic equation is different. With a little guessing and checking, you can find that x equals 4 is a solution.\n Why doesn't the approach that works for all other cupics find the perfectly reasonable solution to this one? Unable to see a way forward, Cardano avoids this case in Ars Magna, saying the idea of the square root of negatives is as subtle as it is useless.\n But around 10 years later, the Italian engineer, Raphael Bombelli, picks up where Cardano left off. Undeterred by the square roots of negatives and the impossible geometry they imply, he wants to find a way through the mess to the solution.\n Observing that the square root of a negative cannot be called either positive or negative, he lets it be its own new type of number. Bombelli assumes the two terms in Cardano's solution can be represented as some combination of an ordinary number and\n and this new type of number which involves the square root of negative 1. And this way Bombelli figures out that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation are equivalent to 2 plus or minus the square root of negative 1. So when he takes the final step and adds them together\n These square roots cancel out, leaving the correct answer 4. This feels nothing short of miraculous. Cardano's method does work, but you have to abandon the geometric proof that generated it in the first place. Negative areas?\n which make no sense in reality, must exist as an intermediate step on the way to the solution. Over the next hundred years, modern mathematics takes shape. In the 1600s, Francois Viette introduces the modern symbolic notation for algebra.\n ending the millennia-long tradition of math problems as drawings and wordy descriptions. Geometry is no longer the source of truth. Rene Descartes makes heavy use of the square roots of negatives, popularizing them as a result. And while\n While he recognizes their utility, he calls them imaginary numbers, a name that sticks, which is why Euler later introduces the letter i to represent the square root of negative 1. When combined with regular numbers, they form complex numbers.\n The cubic led to the invention of these new numbers and liberated algebra from geometry. By letting go of what seems like the best description of reality, the geometry you can see and touch, you get a much more powerful and complete mathematics that can\n solve real problems. And it turns out, the cubic is just the beginning. In 1925, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger is searching for a wave equation that governs the behavior of quantum particles, building on de Broglie's insight that matter consists\n of waves. He comes up with one of the most important and famous equations in all of physics, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and featured prominently within it is I, the square root of negative 1. While mathematicians have grown accustomed to\n imaginary numbers? Physicists have not and are uncomfortable seeing it show up in such a fundamental theory. Schr\u00f6dinger himself writes,\n function psi is surely fundamentally a real function. This seems like a fair objection, so why does an imaginary number that first appeared in the solution to the cubic turn up in fundamental physics? Well, it's because\n of some unique properties of imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line. Together, they form the complex plane. Watch what happens when we repeatedly multiply by\n i. Starting with 1, 1 times i is i. i times i is negative 1 by definition. Negative 1 times i is negative i. And negative i times i is 1. We've come back to where we started\n and if we keep multiplying by i the point will keep rotating around. So when you're multiplying by i what you're really doing is rotating by 90 degrees in a complex plane. Now there is a function that repeatedly multiplies by i\n as you go down the x-axis and that is e to the ix. It creates a spiral by essentially spreading out these rotations all along the x-axis. If you look at the real part of this spiral, it's a cosine wave.\n And if you look at the imaginary part, it's a sine wave. The two quintessential functions that describe waves are both contained in e to the ix. So when Schr\u00f6dinger goes to write down a wave equation, he naturally assumes\n that the solutions to his equation will look something like e to the ix, specifically e to the ikx minus omega t. You might wonder why he would use that formulation and not just a simple sine wave, but the exponential has some useful properties.\n If you take the derivative with respect to position or time, that derivative is proportional to the original function itself. And that's not true if you use the sine function whose derivative is cosine. Plus, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is linear,\n linear, you can add together an arbitrary number of solutions of this form, creating any sort of wave shape you like, and it too will be a solution to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation. The physicist Freeman Dyson later writes,\n minus 1 into the equation and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly it became a wave equation instead of a heat conduction equation. And Schr\u00f6dinger found to his delight that the equation has solutions corresponding to the quantized orbits in the Bohr\n model of the atom. It turns out that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes correctly everything we know about the behavior of atoms. It is the basis of all of chemistry and most of physics. And that square root of minus one means that\n Nature works with complex numbers and not with real numbers. This discovery came as a complete surprise to Schr\u00f6dinger as well as to everybody else. So imaginary numbers discovered as a\n The quirky intermediate step on the way to solving the cubic turned out to be fundamental to our description of reality. Only by giving up maths connection to reality could it guide us to a deeper truth about the way the universe works.\n Not gonna lie, I learned a ton while making this video because I really had to engage with some ideas that I was already familiar with and that is exactly what happened\n with Brilliant, the sponsor of this video.

            "transcription": "This is a video about the oldest unsolved problem in math that dates back 2,000 years. Some of the brightest mathematicians of all time have tried to crack it, but all of them failed. In the year 2000, the\n Italian mathematician Pier Giorgio Odefretti listed it among four of the most pressing open problems at the time. Solving this problem could be as simple as finding a single number. So mathematicians have used computers and checked numbers up\n to 10 to the power of 2200. But so far they've come up empty handed.\n It's beautiful. What else could you want? So the problem is this. Do any odd perfect numbers exist? So what is a perfect number? Well, take the number six for\n example, you can divide it by 1, 2, 3, and 6. But let's ignore 6 because that's the number itself. And now we're left with just the proper divisors. If you add them all up, you find that they add to 6, which is the number itself.\n So numbers like this are called perfect. You can also try this with other numbers like 10. 10 has the proper divisors 1, 2, and 5. If you add those up, you only get 8. So 10 is not a perfect number. Now you can\n repeat this for all other numbers and what you find is that most numbers either overshoot or undershoot. Between 1 and 100, only 6 and 28 are perfect numbers. Go up to 10,000 and you find the next two\n perfect numbers 496 and 8128. These were the only perfect numbers known by the ancient Greeks and they would be the only known ones for over a thousand years. If only we could\n find a pattern that makes these numbers, then we could use that to predict more of them. So what do these numbers have in common? Well, one thing to notice is that each next perfect number is one digit longer than the number that came before\n it. Another thing they share is that the ending digit alternates between 6 and 8, which also means they are all even. But here's where things get really weird.\n You can write 6 as the sum of 1 plus 2 plus 3, and 28 as the sum of 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus 7, and so on for the others as well.\n well. They are all just the sum of consecutive numbers. And you can think of each additional number as adding a new layer, and so these create a triangle, which is why these numbers are called triangular numbers. Also, every number except\n except for 6 is the sum of consecutive odd cubes.\n is equal to 1 cubed plus 3 cubed plus 5 cubed plus 7 cubed plus 9 cubed all the way up to 15 cubed. But here's the one that really blows my mind. If you write these numbers in binary, 6 becomes 110.\n and 28 becomes 11100. 496 becomes 11111000 and 8128\n You guessed it, it is also a string of ones followed by a series of zeros. So if you write them out, they are all just consecutive powers of two.\n Now, around 300 BC, Euclid was actually thinking along similar lines when he discovered the pattern that makes these perfect numbers. Take the number 1 and double it. You get 2. Now keep doubling\n it. You get 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on. Now starting from 1, add the next number to it. So 1 plus 2 equals 3. If that adds up to a prime, then you multiply it by the last number in the sequence to get\n perfect number. So 2 times 3 equals 6, the first perfect number. Now let's keep doing this. Add 1 plus 2 plus 4 and you get 7, which is again prime. So multiply it by the last number, 4, and you get 28.\n The next perfect number. Next add 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 equals 15. But 15 isn't prime, so we continue. Add 16 to get 31. This is prime. So you multiply it by 16 and you get 499.\n Now, you can keep doing this to find bigger and bigger perfect numbers. And using this, we can rewrite the first three. So, 6 equals 1 plus 2 times 2 to the power of 1.\n 28 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 2 squared and 496 equals 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 8 plus 16 times 2 to the power of 4, where the first term is prime. But there's a more convenient way to write this still.\n Take any sum of consecutive powers of 2, so 2 to the power of 0 which is 1, plus 2 to the 1, plus 2 to the 2, all the way up to 2 to the n minus 1, and now because you don't know n, you don't know what that is equal to, but it\n be equal to something, so let's call that t. Now multiply this whole equation by 2. So you get 2 to the 1 plus 2 to the 2 all the way up to 2 to the n, and this is equal to 2t. If you now subtract the first equation from the second,\n almost all the terms will cancel out and you're left with t equals 2 to the n minus 1. So you can replace this whole series with one less than the next power of 2. So 6 becomes 2 squared minus 1 times\n Do you see the pattern? This number is always one more than this.\n So if we call this p, then Euclid's formula that gives a perfect number is 2 to the p minus 1 times 2 to the p minus 1, whenever this is prime. Now because you're multiplying it by 2 to the p minus 1,\n is even, this will always give an even number. Euclid had found a way to generate even perfect numbers, but he didn't prove that this was the only way. So there could be other ways to get perfect numbers\n including potentially ones that are odd. 400 years later, the Greek philosopher Nicomachus published Introductio Arithmetica, the standard arithmetic text for the next thousand years. In it, he stated five conjectures.\n others, statements he believed to be true but did not bother actually trying to prove. His conjectures were 1. The nth perfect number has n digits. 2. All perfect numbers are even. 3.\n all perfect numbers end in 6 and 8 alternately, 4. Euclid's algorithm produces every even perfect number, and 5. There are infinitely many perfect numbers. For the next thousand years, no one could prove or\n disprove any of these conjectures, and they were considered facts. But in the 13th century, Egyptian mathematician Ibn Falis published a list with 10 perfect numbers and their values of p. Three\n of these perfect numbers turned out not to be perfect at all. But the remaining ones are. The fifth perfect number is 8 digits long, which disproves Nicomachus' first conjecture. And the next thing to notice is that both the fifth and sixth\n perfect number end in a 6. So that disproves Nicomachus' third conjecture that all perfect numbers end in a 6 or 8 alternately. Two conjectures were proven false, but what about the other three?\n later the problem reached Renaissance Europe where they rediscovered the fifth, sixth, and seventh perfect numbers. So far every perfect number had Euclid's form and the best way to find new ones was by finding the values of p that make two\n to the p minus 1 prime. So French polymath Marin Mersenne extensively studied numbers of this form. In 1644 he published his results in a book, including a list of 11 values of p for which he claimed they\n corresponded to primes. Numbers for which this is true are now called Mersenne primes. Of his list, the first seven exponents of p do result in primes and they correspond to the first seven perfect numbers. But for some of the larger numbers, like\n to the 67 minus 1, Mersenne admitted to not even checking whether they were prime. To tell if a given number of 15 to 20 digits is prime or not, all time would not suffice for the test.\n Mersenne discussed the problem of perfect numbers with other luminaries of the time, including Pierre de Fermat and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. In 1638, Descartes wrote to Mersenne, I think I can show that there are no even perfect numbers except those of Euclid. He also\n He also believed that if an odd perfect number does exist, it must have a special form. It must be the product of a prime and the square of a different number. If he was right, these would easily have been the biggest breakthroughs on the problem since Euclid,\n But Descartes couldn't prove either of those statements. Instead, he wrote, But whatever method you use, it takes a long time to look for these.\n Around 100 years later, at the St. Petersburg Academy, the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach met a 20-year-old math prodigy. The two stayed in touch, corresponding by mail, and in 1729 Goldbach introduced this young man to the\n work of Fermat. At first, he seemed indifferent, but after a little more prodding by Goldbach, he became passionate about number theory, and he spent the next 40 years working on different problems in the field. Among them was the problem of perfect numbers.\n This prodigy's name was Leonard Euler. Euler picked up where Descartes had left off, but with more success. In doing so, he made three breakthroughs on this problem. First, in 1732, he discovered the eighth\n perfect number, which he had done by verifying that 2 to the 31 minus 1 is prime, just as Mersenne had predicted. For his other two breakthroughs, he invented a new weapon, the sigma function. All this function does\n is it takes all the divisors of a number including the number itself and adds them up. So take any number, say 6, sum up all its divisors and you get 12, which is twice the number we started with. And this will be true for all purposes.\n perfect numbers. The sigma function of a perfect number will always give twice the number itself because the sigma function includes the number as one of its divisors. Now this may seem like a small change, but it ends up being extremely powerful. So let's\n Take a prime number, like 7. Now because it's prime, you can't rearrange it into a rectangle. Therefore, the only divisors are 1 and the prime itself. So sigma 7 is 1 plus 7, which is equal to 8.\n Now, to keep things easier to follow, we'll just stick to the numbers. But what if instead of 7, you had 7 cubed? Well, again, the sum of the divisors is really simple. It's just 1 plus 7 plus 7 squared plus 7 cubed.\n Now let's use it on a different number, say 20. The sum of its divisors is 1 plus 2 plus 4 plus 5 plus 10 plus 20, which equals 42. But you can also write this as 1 plus 2 plus 4 times 1 plus 5.\n And this is what really makes the sigma function so powerful. If you have a number that is made up of other numbers that don't share factors with each other, then you can split up the sigma function into the sigma functions of the prime powers that make it up. So sigma of 2 squared times\n sigma 5 is equal to sigma 20. And since any number can be written as the product of prime powers, you can split up the sigma function of any composite number into the sigma functions of its prime powers. With his new\n function in hand, Euler achieved his second breakthrough and did what Descartes couldn't. He proved that every even perfect number has Euclid's form. This Euclid-Euler theorem solved a 1600 year old problem and proved Nicomache\n Marcus' fourth conjecture. Math historian William Dunham called it the greatest mathematical collaboration in history. But Euler wasn't finished yet. He also wanted to solve the problem of odd perfect numbers. So for his third\n breakthrough, he set out to prove Descartes' other statement, that every odd perfect number must have a specific form. Because if an odd perfect number does exist, you know two things. First, n is odd, and second, sigma of\n n equals 2n. Now any number n you can write as a product of different prime numbers, and each prime can be to some power. So let's take that and put it into Euler's sigma function. So you get sigma of n equals\n sigma of all of those primes to their powers, which equals to n. But since all of these factors are primes, you can actually split up the sigma function into the sigmas of the individual prime powers. Now one thing to notice is that if you have a prime\n number raised to an odd power, for example 7 to the power of 1, then the sigma function will be even, because 1 plus 7 equals 8. You'll always get an even number because odd plus odd is even. If the prime number is instead raised to\n to an even power, like 7 squared, then the sigma function returns an odd number. Sigma of 7 squared equals 1 plus 7 plus 7 squared, which equals 57. Because odd plus odd plus odd equals\n odd. So if you have the sigma function of an odd prime raised to an odd power, it will give an even number. If instead it's raised to an even power, you get an odd number. And this is where Euler's genius insight comes in.\n Because here on the right side you've got 2 times n, where n is an odd perfect number, and 2 is even. Well what that means is that on the left side there must only be one even number, because if there were two even numbers you could factor\n factor out 4, but that means you should also be able to factor out 4 on the right side, which you can't because n is odd, and there's only a single 2 here. So only one of these sigmas here can give an even number.\n which means that there is exactly one prime that is to an odd power, and all the others must be to an even power, just as Descartes had predicted. Now Euler refined the form a bit more and showed that an odd perfect number must\n satisfy this condition. But even Euler couldn't prove whether they existed or not. He wrote, whether there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question. For the next 150 years, very little progress was\n made and no new perfect numbers were discovered. English mathematician Peter Barlow wrote that Euler's 8th perfect number is the greatest that ever will be discovered. For as they are merely curious without being useful, it is not likely that any\n person will ever attempt to find one beyond it. But Barlow was wrong. Mathematicians kept pursuing these elusive perfect numbers. And most started with Mersenne's list of\n proposed primes. The next on his list was 2 to the 67 minus 1. So far, Mersenne had done an excellent job. He had included Euler's 8th perfect number while avoiding others like 29 that turned out not to lead to a perfect\n But 230 years after Mersenne published his list, Eduard Luka proved that 2 to the 67 minus 1 was not prime, although he was unable to find its factors. 27 years later, Frank Nelson Cole\n gave a talk to the American Mathematical Society. Without saying a word, he walked to one side of the blackboard and wrote down 2 to the 67 minus 1 equals 147 quintillion 573 quadrillion 952\n trillion five hundred eighty nine billion six hundred seventy six million four hundred twelve thousand nine hundred and twenty seven. He then walked to the other side of the blackboard and multiplied one hundred ninety three million seven hundred seven thousand seven hundred twenty one times\n 761,838,257,287 giving the same answer. He sat down without saying a word and the audience erupted in applause. He later admitted\n It took him three years working on Sundays to solve this. A modern computer could solve this in less than a second. From 500 BC until 1952, people had discovered just 12 Mersenne primes and therefore only\n 12 perfect numbers. The main difficulty was checking whether large Mersenne numbers were actually prime. But in 1952, American mathematician Raphael Robinson wrote a computer program to perform this task, and he ran it on the fastest computer at\n the time, the SWAC. Within 10 months he found the next 5 Mersenne primes, and so corresponding perfect numbers. And over the next 50 years, new Mersenne primes were discovered in rapid succession, all using computer\n computers.\n Since these numbers were getting so astronomically large, the task of finding numersand primes became more and more difficult,\n even for supercomputers. So in 1996, computer scientist George Woltman launched the great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, or GIMPS. GIMPS distributes the work over many computers, allowing anyone to volunteer their computer power\n to help search for Mersenne primes. The project has been highly successful so far, having discovered 17 new Mersenne primes, 15 of which were the largest known primes at that time. And the best part? If your computer discovers a new Mersenne\n you'll be listed as its discoverer, adding yourself to a list that includes some of the best mathematicians of all time. There's even a $250,000 prize for the first billion-digit prime.\n In 2017, church deacon John Pace discovered the 50th Mersenne prime by using GIMPs. The number, 2 to the 77,232,917 minus 1, is more than 23 million digits.\n To celebrate this achievement, the Japanese publishing house Nanai Roshia published this book, the largest prime number of 2017. And all it is, is that number.\n number spread over 719 glorious pages. It's wild. The size of this font is so tiny. The book quickly rose to the number one spot on Amazon and sold out in four days.\n A year later, the 51st Mersenne Prime was discovered. It's 2 to the 82,589,933 minus 1. And this number has 24 million\n There's something I enjoy about the absurdity, like there is knowledge in here but it's not the kind of knowledge that anyone's ever gonna read out of a book.\n some way it's nice that there's this physical artifact that like has the number. If ever we lost all the prime numbers, you know, someone could find this book and be like, here's a big one. As of today, this is still the largest known\n prime, and since numbers of this form grow so rapidly, the largest Mersenne prime is almost always the largest known prime. Computers have been incredibly successful at finding new Mersenne primes and their corresponding\n perfect numbers, but we've still only found 51 so far. So you might suspect that there are only a finite number of them, which would mean that Nicomachus' fifth conjecture would be false, that there aren't infinitely many perfect numbers.\n But that might not be the case. The Lenstra-Palmerant-Wagstaff conjecture predicts how many Mersenne primes should appear based on how large P is. Now this is the actual data. The conjecture performs remarkably well.\n But more importantly, it predicts that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, and so infinitely many even perfect numbers. The Mersenne primes are just so large and rare that they take a lot of time and computer resources to find.\n But a conjecture is not a proof, and up until this day, this problem shares the title of oldest unsolved problem in math with the other open problem. Do any odd perfect numbers exist?\n The easiest way to solve this problem is by finding an example. So maybe we could just check different odd numbers and see if one of them is perfect. That's exactly what researchers tried in 1991 by using a smart algorithm.\n algorithm called a factor chain, they were able to show that if an odd perfect number does exist, it must be larger than 10 to the power of 300. 21 years later, Pascal Ockham and Michael Rau raised that lower bound to 10 to the 1,500.\n With recent progress pushing that number up to 10 to the 2200. With numbers that large, it's unlikely that a computer will find one anytime soon. So we'll need to get smart. What would a proof look like? Like how could we actually prove\n this.\n and maybe thousands of non-distinct prime factors, and it has to be bigger than 10 to the 3,000, and it has to do all these different things, and we hope that eventually there's just so many conditions that constrain the number of prime factors.\n so much that they can't exist. Since Euler, mathematicians have kept adding new conditions to this web. But so far it hasn't worked. But there might be another path. When Descartes was looking for odd perfect numbers, he came across\n 198,585,576,189, which you can factor as 3 squared times 7 squared times 11 squared times 13 squared times 22,021.\n Put this into Euler's sigma function and you find it is equal to 2 times the original number. In other words, it is perfect. That is, if 22,021 were prime. But it's not, because it is equal to 19 square\n at time 61. And filling that in shows that it is not perfect. Numbers like this that are very close to being odd perfect numbers are called spoofs. Spoofs are a larger group of numbers, so odd perfect numbers\n Spoofs share all properties of spoofs and then a few extra ones. The goal is to find properties of spoofs that ultimately prevent them from being odd perfect numbers. For example, one condition of odd perfect numbers is that they can't be divided by 100\n So, if you find that spoofs must be divisible by 105, then this would prove that odd perfect numbers can't exist. In 2022, Pace Nielsen and a team at BYU found 21 spoof numbers, including Descartes\n number. And while they discovered some new properties of spoofs, they didn't find any that rule out odd perfect numbers. So how large would an odd perfect number have to be? They don't exist. You don't think\n odd perfect numbers exist? No, they don't exist. I wish they did. That'd be really cool if there was this one gigantic odd perfect number out in the universe. They don't exist. No. How are\n you convince that they don't exist? There is something called a heuristic argument where it's not a proof, so if we had a proof we'd be done, it's just an argument from, okay, we think primes occur\n this often of this type and you put that those pieces of information together and you think okay on average how many numbers should be perfect. This argument which was made by Karl Pomerantz predicts that between 10 to the 2200 and\n infinity there are no more than 10 to the negative 540 perfect numbers of the form n equals p m squared.\n We've searched high enough now that we think we have enough evidence they shouldn't exist anymore. My understanding is this heuristic argument, it also predicts that there are no large perfect numbers.\n even or odd. So that's true. So there's a downside to it. Yeah, there's a downside because it says there shouldn't be large even perfect numbers and we actually expect there to be\n infinitely many. And so, okay, so why do I believe the heuristic in this case and not this case? You're right. Am I being hypocritical about that? There are other aspects you can add on to the heuristic and make it stronger. Let me put it that way.\n But you're right, it's not a proof. For now, this is still the oldest unsolved problem in math. Euler was right when he said, whether there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question. So are there any\n any applications of this problem? I can say no. Now, many people may think that if there are no applications to the real world, then there's no point studying it. Why should anyone\n hair about some old unsolved problem. But I think that's the wrong approach. For more than 2,000 years, number theory had no real-world applications. It was just mathematicians following their curiosity and solving problems they found interesting,\n improving one result after another and building a foundation of useless mathematics. But then in the 20th century, we realized that we could take this foundation and base our cryptography on it. This is what protects everything from text messages to government\n secrets.\n 199 ways of not making a light bulb eventually I got a good way to do it It's the same with math you you have a problem and you throw your mind at it and others do too and you come up with new ideas and eventually Something good comes from that process\n Einstein's general relativity was built on non-Euclidean geometries, geometries that were developed as intellectual curiosities without foresight of how they would one day change the way we understand the universe.\n problem\n a great problem to think about and you can make progress, you can figure out new things.

            "transcription": "A single sentence in one of the oldest math books held the key to understanding our universe. Euclid's Elements has been published in more editions than any other book except the Bible. It was the go-to math text for over two\n thousand years. But for all that time, mathematicians were skeptical of a single line, which seemed like a mistake. Ultimately, some of the greatest math minds realized that Euclid wasn't wrong after all.\n But there was more to the story. Slight tweaks to this line opened up strange new universes out of nothing. Surprisingly, 80 years later, we found out those strange new universes are core\n to understanding our own universe. Around 300 BC, the Greek mathematician Euclid takes on a massive project to summarize all mathematics known at the\n time, to essentially create the one book that contains everything that everyone knows about mathematics. But that's no easy task. See, before Euclid, there was a bit of a problem with math. It would prove things.\n But they would just be going around in circles. Why does a triangle have 180 degrees? Because if you take two parallel lines, yeah, but why do parallel lines exist? Oh, that's because that's because you can make a square. Why does a square exist? You have this infinite recursion of what the fundamental reason why something is true is. It's kind of like\n In the dictionary, every word is defined in terms of other words. So how do you get to ground truth? Euclid used a solution that was pioneered by the Greeks. Let's just accept a few of the most simple basic things as\n being true. These are our postulates. Then based upon these postulates, we can prove theorems, one at a time, building up our math using logic. So that as long as those first statements are true, then everything else that follows from them must\n definitely be true. He had perfected the gold standard for rigorous mathematical proof that all modern math relies on. Euclid used this method when he published his 13 book series called The Elements, in\n which he proved 465 theorems covering almost all of mathematics known at the time, including geometry and number theory. And all these theorems depended on were some definitions, a few common notions, and five postulates.\n We go right to book one and book one starts with definitions. You got to start somewhere and the definition is a point is that which has no part. A line is a breathless length and the ends of lines are points.\n By line he really means a curve and then it has some ends. A straight line is a line that lies evenly within the points on itself and then so on and so forth. He's got 23 definitions, then he's got the five postulates.\n The first four are simple. One, if you have two points, you can draw a straight line between them. Two, if you have a straight line, you can extend it indefinitely. Three, given a center and a radius, you can draw a circle.\n And the fourth is that all right angles are equal to each other. But postulate five gets the big guns. Which is that if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles,\n What the hell is he talking about? That's a postulate? Like all of these are, you know, half of a sentence and they're all blatantly obvious.\n comes five out of left field and it's like an entire paragraph what is he doing this made mathematicians suspicious it seemed like Euclid made a mistake Greek philosopher Proclus thought postulate five ought even to be\n struck out of the postulates altogether, for it is a theorem. But if it's a theorem, we should be able to prove it from the first four postulates, so that's what many people tried. Some, including Ptolemy and Proclus, believed they had succeeded.\n but they hadn't. In fact all they managed to do was just restate postulate five in different words. Here's one formulation. If you have a line and a point that is not on that line then there is a single\n unique line which will be parallel to the first line. For this reason the fifth postulate is often called the parallel postulate. When the method of direct proof failed, other mathematicians including Alhatham and Omar Khyan\n The idea is simple. You keep the first four postulates the same, but assume that the fifth postulate is false. Then you use those new postulates to prove theorems. And if that leads to a contradiction,\n So, what would it look like if the\n the fifth postulate were false. According to Euclid, through a point not on a line, there could only be one line that is parallel to the first. One alternative is that there are no parallel lines that you could draw through that point. Well people tried that and they\n realized that then lines had to be finite in length. Now, like, well that can't be. So this option was ruled out. It contradicted the second postulate, which states that lines can be extended indefinitely. The other alternative is that you can draw more than\n one parallel line through a point not on the first line. So proof by contradiction also failed. In total, mathematicians spent more\n more than 2000 years trying to prove the fifth postulate, but everyone who tried failed. Then around 1820, Janos Voliae, a 17 year old student, started spending his\n days and nights working on the mystery. His father became worried, and he wrote to his son,\n and joy in my life. I entreat you, leave the science of parallels alone. Learn from my example.\" But the young Bollieye didn't listen to his father. He could not leave the science of parallels\n After years of work, he realized that maybe the fifth postulate can't be proven from the other four. It could be completely independent. See, according to Euclid, you could have only one parallel line that\n through a point, but Bolleye imagined a world where there could be more than one parallel line through that point. But how? Well, who said you needed to have a flat surface? On a surface that is curved like this, you can draw more than one line that is parallel\n to the original line. But wait a second, those lines don't look straight. Well, what makes straight lines special is that they're the shortest paths between two points. On this surface, those shortest paths just look bent because the surface is curved.\n Here's a more familiar example. Airplanes always try to fly the shortest path between two cities. They're basically flying in a straight line. But that line doesn't look straight on a map because the surface is curved. These shortest paths on\n curved surfaces are called geodesics. So all these lines are straight, they just don't look it because the world Bollii had imagined turned out to be curved. We now know this as hyperbolic geometry.\n You know, when I used to think of the hyperbolic plane, I would just imagine it as one giant saddle. But that's not really what it is. The hyperbolic plane is much more like this piece of crocheting. So it starts out pretty flat and even in the middle,\n But as you move outwards, more and more fabric is created and that would push parallel lines apart. And the further and further out you go, the amount of fabric grows exponentially and that ends up causing\n But that little piece of crochet isn't the full hyperbolic plane.\n To show that, we need to make a map, one that fits the entire plane into a disk. To show how this works, we're going to fill the entire plane with these triangles. Starting in the middle, just as with the crochet, things look pretty normal.\n But as you go farther out from the center, you get all this extra space so you can fit more and more triangles. So they appear smaller, but they are actually the same size. Now, since the hyperbolic plane is infinite, you can keep adding\n triangles forever, and they all need to fit on the disk, so as you get closer to the edge, the triangles will appear smaller and smaller and smaller, infinitely smaller, never ending, and you can never quite reach the edge.\n This is known as the Poincar\u00e9 Disc Model. Here, straight lines are arcs of circles that intersect the disc at 90 degrees. And just like on our original shape, a straight line down the middle appears straight, while straight lines next to it appear to curve away.\n What's remarkable is that Balai didn't have a model of hyperbolic geometry yet. He was just drawing Euclidean triangles with the assumption that Euclid's fifth postulate didn't hold. And while Balai found that the behavior in hyperbolic\n geometry is very different than Euclid's, mathematically it seemed just as consistent. In 1823, the 20-year-old Janos wrote to his dad,\n But Bullyeye had been doing more than just tackling ancient math mysteries. In his 20s, he joined the army.\n where he continued developing two of his other passions, playing the violin and dueling. He had mastered both, but with a sword in particular he was unmatched. Perhaps because of his many talents, Bully Eye grew arrogant and found it difficult to\n accept authority from his superiors. That made him hard to get along with. This reached a peak when during one of his deployments, 13 cavalry officers from his garrison challenged him to a duel. Boleai accepted their challenge\n on the condition that after every two duels he could play for a little while on his violin. Volley-eye fought each of them in succession, winning all 13 duels and leaving behind all his adversaries on the square.\n While Bulleye loved dueling, his first love was still mathematics. In 1832, nine years after he discovered his strange new universe, he published his findings as a 24-page appendix to his father's textbook.\n Extremely proud and excited about his son's work, Farkas Bolleis sent it to perhaps the greatest mathematician of all time, Carl Friedrich Gauss. After careful examination, Gauss replied a few months later, to praise it would amount to praising\n myself, for the entire content of the work coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past 30 or 35 years. Years earlier, Gauss had wandered a similar path.\n In 1824, he wrote a private letter to one of his friends in which he describes discovering a curious geometry, one with paradoxical and to the uninitiated, absurd theorems. For example, Gauss writes,\n angles of a triangle become as small as one wishes if only the sides are taken large enough. Yet the area of the triangle can never exceed a definite limit. In other words, you can have a triangle that's infinitely long\n but the area is finite. You can see why by using the Poincare disk model. A small triangle looks pretty ordinary, but as you make it bigger, the angles start to become smaller and smaller. Eventually,\n all those angles go to zero, because all these lines intersect the disk at 90 degrees. Now these lines are infinitely long, but because of the geometry, the area is finite. In the same private\n Just like Bollii, Gauss had found that this geometry seemed thoroughly consistent,\n He named it non-Euclidean geometry, a name that stuck. It describes geometries where Euclid's first four postulates hold, but the fifth doesn't. But Gauss decided not to publish his findings for fear of ridicule. This aversion\n to a different kind of geometry should at least be a little surprising, because there is one other geometry that we should be very familiar with, spherical geometry, since we all live on a sphere. On a sphere, straight lines are parts of\n And we can use this to see how straight lines behave. These lines seem to go in\n in the same direction, but as you keep extending them, you find that they intersect, once, and then again on the other side of the Earth. And this will always happen for any two great circles, because they must each have the largest possible\n So on a sphere, there are no parallel lines. Gauss had long been fascinated by spherical geometry. He was also a geodeticist and frequently took measurements of the earth. In the 1820s, he was tasked with\n with surveying the Kingdom of Hanover to help make a map. As part of this survey, he climbed the mountains near G\u00f6ttingen. With the help of people situated on other landmarks, they were able to carefully measure the angles of several triangles, which would then be used to determine the position\n of one place relative to another. As a reference for the survey and to help determine the roundness of the earth, they also precisely measured the angles of a large triangle formed by three mountains. But for all of Gauss's romantic\n notions of taking measurements on top of mountains, he was not the kindest correspondent. When Bullyi received his hero's response, he was devastated, believing that Gauss was trying to undermine him and steal his ideas. He was so\n So embittered by Gauss's response that he never published again. In 1848, Bollii had to endure another hardship when he found out that Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky had independently discovered non-Euclidean geometry.\n several years before Bolliei had published his 24-page long appendix. When Bolliei died in 1860, he left behind 20,000 pages of unpublished mathematical manuscripts. He would not know that Gauss\n did independently discover non-Euclidean geometry, nor would he know that upon receiving the appendix, Gauss had written to a friend, I regard this young Geometer Bollii as a genius of the first order.\n While Bully Eye was embittered, non-Euclidean geometries continued to develop. Until 1854, spherical geometry wasn't actually considered a non-Euclidean geometry. That's because on a sphere,\n But in 1854, Riemann changed the second postulate from an infinite number of numbers to an infinite number of numbers.\n infinite extension to something that is, quote, unbounded, so that the second postulate still holds on a sphere. With this change, spherical geometry became another valid non-Euclidean geometry. By using the generalized\n four postulates and taking the fifth as there being no parallel lines, you could now derive spherical or elliptic geometry. Would you consider the fifth postulate a mistake? Would it have been better if he just never wrote that down?\n If he never wrote that down he would have stunted his geometry because he wouldn't be able to prove a lot of things that he claimed to have. It's beautiful that he wrote this. It's beautiful that people spent 2,000 years trying to refute him only to discover that in fact he was right.\n So, while Euclid was right to write down the fifth postulate, he did make a different mistake.\n What does it mean to have a part? What does it mean not to have a part? A line is a breathless length. What does it mean to have breath? Lying evenly within itself? Within the points in itself? What the hell is he talking about? We read this two minutes ago and we\n We were nodding along like, yeah, it completely makes sense what he's saying. It's all nonsense. Don't give me a definition that's going to have an infinite recursion. If you give me a definition in terms of other things, then you have to tell me what those things are. If you tell me what that is, you have to tell me what the thing before it is.\n definitions a bad idea? You shouldn't have definitions. You should have undefined terms. I'm not gonna tell you what a plane is. I'm not gonna tell you what a line is. I'm not gonna tell you what a plane is. All I'm gonna tell you is what the postulates are that\n they are assumed to satisfy. It's the relationships between the objects that's important, not the definitions of the objects themselves. And once you free your mind to that possibility, all of a sudden you realize that there is a perfectly good geometric world in which by line\n you mean great circle and by plane you mean sphere and by point you mean a point on a sphere and then four of those axioms are satisfied just not the fifth and similarly there's another model something called a disk model for hyperbolic space\n which the disc is the plane. What I mean by straight lines is arcs of circles that are orthogonal to the disc and then points are points inside the disc and the disc is the plane. See you can think of geometry as a\n a game. The first four postulates are like the minimum rules required to play that game. And then the fifth postulate selects the world that you'll play in. If you pick that there are no parallel lines, you're playing in spherical geometry. If you choose one parallel\n But Riemann decided to take it one step further. Instead of selecting just one world to play in, why not\n combine them all into one. During his inaugural speech in 1854, he laid out the groundwork for a geometry where the curvature could differ from place to place. One part might be flat, another part might be slightly curved, and yet another\n part might have a very strong curvature. And this geometry wouldn't be limited to two-dimensional planes either. It could be extended to three or more dimensions. Another breakthrough came in 1868.\n when Eugenio Beltrami unequivocally proved that hyperbolic and spherical geometry were just as consistent as Euclid's flat geometry. That is, if there were any inconsistencies in hyperbolic or spherical geometry, then they must also be present in Euclid's\n flat geometry. The prospects for these new geometries were looking great, and it turns out this was just the beginning. In 1905, Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity, which is based on just two postulates.\n One, the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, and two, the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all inertial observers. So, as a result, space and time must be relative.\n But that created a problem for Newtonian gravity, because according to Newton, the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the distance between the two objects squared. But in Einstein's special relativity, that distance is no longer well\n defined? In whose reference frame are we measuring? And so, Einstein had to find a way to reconcile relativity and gravity. Two years later, in 1907, Einstein had the happiest thought of his life. He imagined a man\n man falling off the roof of a house. What made Einstein so joyful is that he realized that while the man is falling, he would feel absolutely weightless, and if he let go of an object, it would just remain in uniform motion relative to him. It would be just like\n being in space, not near any masses, floating around in a spaceship at constant velocity. And that is an inertial observer. Now here's the big breakthrough. Einstein realized that they're not just similar, they are identical.\n because there is no experiment you could do to determine whether you're in freefall in a uniform gravitational field or whether you're in deep space, not near any massive objects. And so the free-falling man too must be an inertial observer.\n over, meaning he is not accelerating and he's not experiencing any force of gravity. But if gravity is not a force, then how do you explain things like the space station orbiting Earth? Shouldn't it just fly off in a straight line?\n Astronauts in the space station also feel weightless. And that's the key. It feels just as if they're traveling at constant velocity in a straight line. It feels like that because that's precisely what they're doing. They're traveling in a straight line.\n How then could that straight line appear curved to a distant observer? The answer is because the space-time that straight line is on is curved. See, massive objects curve space-time, and objects moving through curves\n space time will follow the shortest path through that curved geometry, the geodesic. So while astronauts in the space station are following a straight line, it appears curved to a distant observer because the Earth curves the space time around it.\n So the behavior of straight lines in curved geometries is core to understanding the universe we live in. And in the more than a hundred years since it was published, the general theory of relativity has been remarkably successful.\n In 2014, astronomers briefly observed a supernova, a violent and extremely bright death of a star. In fact, they saw the exact same supernova in four different places. How? Well, in between the supernova and Earth, there was a\n massive galaxy which curved space-time. So light from the supernova, which was spreading out in all directions, had several different paths to reach the earth. And four of those reached earth at approximately the same time. The galaxy had functioned as a massive\n gravitational lens. The astronomers realized that other galaxies in the cluster might also lens the light from that supernova, but with different path lengths and gravitational potentials, so the light would reach Earth at different times.\n After careful modeling, they predicted that they should see a replay of that supernova just a year later. And on the 11th of December, 2015, just as predicted, they saw the same supernova once more.\n In addition to being able to observe the effects of curved spacetime, we can now even measure the ripples of spacetime itself, gravitational waves formed by cosmic events far, far away, like the merger of black holes.\n And according to a recent survey by Nanograv, the fabric of spacetime seems to be buzzing with the remnants of grand cosmic events. In the hundred years since General Relativity was published, countless findings have supported its predictions, and at its\n very core are the curved geometries of Bollii and Riemann. But so far, all the effects we've looked at are local distortions of spacetime. What is the shape of the entire universe?\n Using the differences between the geometries, we can find that out too. In flat geometry, we expect all the angles of a triangle to add up to 180 degrees without fail. But in spherical geometry, the angles don't add up to 180 degrees.\n but to more. Similarly, in hyperbolic geometry, the angles add up to less than 180 degrees. So, to determine the shape of the universe, you just need to measure the angles of a triangle. And measuring a triangle is precisely what Gauss was\n doing 200 years ago. In fact, this led some to speculate that he was actually trying to measure the curvature of space itself. The angle he found? 180 degrees within observational error. But that shouldn't be very\n Very surprising. Take this balloon for example, which approximates a sphere. If I draw a small triangle on it, well the surface I'm drawing on is basically flat, so the angles inside the triangle will add up to essentially 180 degrees.\n Only if I make the triangle large enough will the effects of curvature come into play, and then the angles in the triangle will add up to more than 180 degrees. And this was the problem with Gauss's experiment. Even if he was trying to measure the curvature of\n space itself, for which there is no solid evidence, the triangle he measured would have been far too small relative to the size of the universe. So in order to overcome the scale issue that Gauss encountered, we need to\n scale the triangles formed between mountains up to the largest triangles we can. And since looking further and further away is the same as looking further back in time, we need to look back as far as possible, to the very first light we can see.\n the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, a picture from when the universe was just 380,000 years old. While the CMB is almost completely uniform, there are some spots that are slightly hotter or colder.\n Now we know how far away the CMB is, so if we can figure out how large such a spot is, then we can draw a cosmic triangle. It's thought that the first density and temperature variations originated from quantum fluctuations in\n the very early universe, which were then blown up as the universe expanded. But due to this rapid expansion, not all regions were in causal contact with each other. So using the information we have of how the early universe evolved,\n Numbers can predict how often spots of different sizes should appear in the CMB. This is what this power spectrum shows, essentially a histogram of how often each spot size should occur if the universe is flat.\n So now we have something to compare our measurement to. If the universe is flat, the angle we measure on the sky should be the same as we'd expect. But if the universe is curved like a sphere, the angles of the triangle should add up to more than 180 degrees.\n so the angle we'd measure would be larger than predicted, and this peak would shift to the left. Similarly, if the universe has hyperbolic geometry, then spots should appear smaller than predicted, and this peak would shift to the right.\n What do we measure? This is the data from the Planck mission, which is almost exactly what you'd expect if the universe were flat. This mission also gives us the current best estimate for the curvature of the universe, which is 0.0007 plus minus\n So, that's basically zero within the margin of error. So we're fairly certain that the universe we live in is flat. But living in a flat universe seems to be remarkably\n serendipitous. Right now the average mass-energy density comes down to the equivalent of about 6 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. If on average that was just one more hydrogen atom, the universe would have been more spherically curved. If there were just one less,\n The curvature would be hyperbolic geometry. And so far, we're not entirely sure why the universe has the mass-energy density it has. What we do know is that general relativity is one of our best physical theories of reality. And at the very heart\n Part of it are those paradoxical and seemingly absurd geometries, ones we found because mathematicians spent over 2,000 years thinking about a single sentence from the world's most famous math text.\n When it comes to human brilliance, it's not just what you know, it's also how you think.

If you have X rabbits this year, how many rabbits will you have next year? Well, the simplest model I can imagine is where we just multiply by some number, the growth rate R, which could be say 2.\n And this would mean the population would double every year. And the problem with that is it means the number of rabbits would grow exponentially forever. So I can add the term 1 minus x to represent the constraints of the environment.

And if you graph the population next year versus the population this year, you see it is just an inverted parabola.\n It's the simplest equation you can make that has a negative feedback loop. The bigger the population gets over here, the smaller it'll be the following year. So let's try an example. Let's say we're dealing with a particularly active group of\n rabbits so r equals 2.6 and then let's pick a starting population of 40% of the maximum so 0.4 and then times 1 minus 0.4 and we get\n .624. Okay, so the population increased in the first year, but what we're really interested in is the long-term behavior of this population. So we can put this population back into the equation, and to speed things up you can actually type 2.6\n 6 times answer times 1 minus answer get 0.61 so the population dropped a little hit it again 0.619 0.613 0.617 0.618\n .616, .615, and if I keep hitting enter here you see that the population doesn't really change. It has stabilized which matches what we see in the wild. Populations often remain the same as long as births and deaths are balanced.\n Now I want to make a graph of this iteration. You can see here that it's reached an equilibrium value of 0.615. Now what would happen if I changed the initial population? I'm just going to move this slider here and\n what you see is the first few years change but the equilibrium population remains the same. So we can basically ignore the initial population. So what I'm really interested in is how does the\n this equilibrium population vary depending on r, the growth rate. As you can see if I lower the growth rate the equilibrium population decreases. That makes sense. And in fact if r goes below\n one, well then the population drops and eventually goes extinct. So what I want to do is make another graph where on the x-axis I have r, the growth rate, and on the y-axis\n axis, I'm plotting the equilibrium population, the population you get after many, many, many generations. Okay, for low values of r, we see the populations always go extinct, so the equilibrium value is zero. But once r hits one, the population\n stabilizes onto a constant value and the higher R is the higher the equilibrium population. So far so good, but now comes the weird part. Once R passes 3, the graph\n splits in two. Why? What's happening? Well, no matter how many times you iterate the equation, it never settles onto a single constant value. Instead, it oscillates back and forth between two values.\n One year the population is higher, the next year lower, and then the cycle repeats. The cyclic nature of populations is observed in nature too. One year there might be more rabbits, and then fewer the next year, and more again the year after. As R continues to increase,\n The fork spreads apart, and then each one splits again. Now, instead of oscillating back and forth between two values, populations go through a four-year cycle before repeating. Since the length of the cycle, or period, has doubled,\n These are known as period doubling bifurcations. And as r increases further, there are more period doubling bifurcations. They come faster and faster, leading to cycles of 8, 16, 32, 64, and then at r equals 3.5.\n Chaos. The population never settles down at all. It bounces around as if at random. In fact, this equation provided one of the first methods of generating random numbers on computers. It was a way to get something unpredictable.\n from a deterministic machine. There is no pattern here, no repeating. Of course if you did know the exact initial conditions you could calculate the values exactly, so they are considered only pseudo random numbers. Now you might expect the\n equation to be chaotic from here on out. But as r increases, order returns. There are these windows of stable periodic behavior amid the chaos. For example, at r equals 3.83, there is a stable cycle with a period of\n three years, and as r continues to increase, it splits into 6, 12, 24, and so on before returning to chaos. In fact, this one equation contains periods of every length, 37, 51, 1000,\n 152, whatever you like if you just have the right value of R. Looking at this bifurcation diagram, you may notice that it looks like a fractal. The large-scale features look to be repeated on smaller\n and smaller scales, and sure enough if you zoom in you see that it is in fact a fractal. Arguably the most famous fractal is the Mandelbrot set. The plot twist here is that the bifurcation diagram is\n actually part of the Mandelbrot set. How does that work? Well quick recap on the Mandelbrot set. It is based on this iterated equation. So the way it works is you pick a number C, any number in the column\n complex plane, and then start with z equals zero. And then iterate this equation over and over again. If it blows up to infinity, well then the number c is not part of the set. But if this number remains finite after\n limited iterations, well then it is part of the Mandelbrot set. So let's try for example c equals 1. So we've got 0 squared plus 1 equals 1, then 1 squared plus 1 equals 2, 2 squared plus 1 equals\n 5, 5 squared plus 1 equals 26. So pretty quickly you can see that with c equals 1 this equation is going to blow up. So the number 1 is not part of the Mandelbrot set. What if we try c equals negative 1?\n Well then we've got 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1, negative 1 squared minus 1 equals 0, and so we're back to 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1. So we see that this function is going to keep oscillating back and forth between negative 1 and 0.\n and so it'll remain finite and so c equals negative 1 is part of the Mandelbrot set. Now normally when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot set it just shows you the boundary between the numbers that cause this\n iterated equation to remain finite and those that cause it to blow up. But it doesn't really show you how these numbers stay finite. So what we've done here is actually iterated that equation thousands of times and\n and then plotted on the z-axis the value that that iteration actually takes. So if we look from the side, what you'll actually see is the bifurcation diagram.\n It is part of this Mandelbrot set. So what's really going on here? Well, what this is showing us is that all of the numbers in the main cardioid, they end up stabilizing onto\n a single constant value. But the numbers in this main bulb, well they end up oscillating back and forth between two values. And in this bulb, they end up oscillating between four values. They've got a period of four.\n and then 8 and then 16, 32 and so on and then you hit the chaotic part. The chaotic part of the bifurcation diagram happens out here on what's called the needle of the Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set gets really thin.\n And you can see this medallion here that looks like a smaller version of the entire Mandelbrot set. Well that corresponds to the window of stability in the bifurcation plot with a period of three. Now the bifurcation diagram only exists on\n the real line because we only put real numbers into our equation. But all of these bulbs off of the main cardioid, well they also have periodic cycles of for example three\n or four or five and so you see these repeated ghostly images if we look in the z-axis effectively they're oscillating between these values as well\n Personally, I find this extraordinarily beautiful. But if you're more practically minded, you may be asking, but does this equation actually model populations of animals? And the answer is\n is yes, particularly in the controlled environment scientists have set up in labs. What I find even more amazing is how this one simple equation applies to a huge range of totally unrelated areas of science.\n The first major experimental confirmation came from a fluid dynamicist named Lib Schaber. He created a small rectangular box with mercury inside, and he used a small temperature gradient\n to induce convection. Just two counter-rotating cylinders of fluid inside his box. That's all the box was large enough for. And of course he couldn't look in and see what the fluid was doing, so he measured the temperature using a probe in the\n top and what he saw was a regular spike, a periodic spike in the temperature. That's like when the logistic equation converges on a single value. But as he increased the temperature gradient, a wobble developed on those rolling cylinder\n at half the original frequency. The spikes in temperature were no longer the same height. Instead, they went back and forth between two different heights. He had achieved period two, and as he continued to\n increase the temperature he saw period doubling again. Now he had four different temperatures before the cycle repeated and then eight. This was a pretty spectacular confirmation of the theory in a beautifully crafted\n experiment. But this was only the beginning. Scientists have studied the response of our eyes and salamander eyes to flickering lights and what they find is a period doubling that once the light reaches a certain\n rate of flickering, our eyes only respond to every other flicker. It's amazing in these papers to see the bifurcation diagram emerge, albeit a bit fuzzy because it comes from real-world data. In another study,\n Scientists gave rabbits a drug that sent their hearts into fibrillation. I guess they felt there were too many rabbits out there. I mean, if you don't know what fibrillation is, it's where your heart beats in an incredibly irregular way and doesn't really pump any blood. So if you don't fix it, you die.\n But what they found was on the path to fibrillation, they found the period doubling route to chaos. The rabbit started out with a periodic beat and then it went into a two cycle, two beats close together, and then a four cycle\n cycle, four different beats before it repeated again, and eventually a periodic behavior. Now what was really cool about this study was they monitored the heart in real time and used chaos theory to determine when to apply electrical shock\n of the heart to return it to periodicity and they were able to do that successfully. So they used chaos to control a heart and figure out a smarter way to deliver electric shocks to set it beating normally again. That's pretty amazing.\n And then there is the issue of the dripping faucet. Most of us, of course, think of dripping faucets as very regular periodic objects, but a lot of research has gone into finding that once the flow rate increases a little bit,\n bit you get period doubling. So now the drips come two at a time. And eventually from a dripping faucet you can get chaotic behavior just by adjusting the flow rate. And you think like what really is a faucet? Well there's\n constant pressure water and a constant size aperture and yet what you're getting is chaotic dripping. So this is a really easy chaotic system you can experiment with at home. Go open a tap just a little bit and see\n if you can get aperiodic dripping in your house. The bifurcation diagram pops up in so many different places that it starts to feel spooky. Now I want to tell you something that'll make it seem even spookier.\n There was this physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum who was looking at when the bifurcations occur He divided the width of each bifurcation section by the next one and he found that ratio closed in on this number\n which is now called the Feigenbaum constant. The bifurcations come faster and faster, but in a ratio that approaches this fixed value. And no one knows where this constant\n comes from. It doesn't seem to relate to any other known physical constant, so it is itself a fundamental constant of nature. What's even crazier is that it doesn't have to be the particular form\n of the equation I showed you earlier. Any equation that has a single hump, if you iterate it the way that we have, so you could use xn plus 1 equals sine x for example, if you iterate that one again and again and again, you will also\n see bifurcations. Not only that, but the ratio of when those bifurcations occur will have the same scaling, 4.669, any single hump function iterated\n will give you that fundamental constant. So why is this? Well, it's referred to as universality because there seems to be something fundamental and very universal about\n this process, this type of equation, and that constant value. In 1976, the biologist Robert May wrote a paper in Nature about this very equation. It sparked a revolution in people looking into this\n I mean that paper's been cited thousands of times and in the paper he makes this plea that we should teach students about this simple equation because it gives you a new intuition for ways in which simple things\n Simple equations can create very complex behaviors. And I still think that today we don't really teach this way. I mean we teach simple equations and simple outcomes because\n Those are the easy things to do and those are the things that make sense. We're not gonna throw chaos at students, but maybe we should maybe we should throw at least a little bit which is why I've been so excited about chaos and I am so excited about this equation because\n Because, you know, how did I get to be 37 years old without hearing of the Feigenbaum constant? Ever since I read James Gleek's book, Chaos, I have wanted to make videos on this topic and now I'm finally getting around to\n it and hopefully I'm doing this topic justice because I find it incredibly fascinating and I hope you do too.

            "transcription": "This is a video about the most important algorithm of all time, the Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT. I mean, you use it all the time, including right now to watch this video, and it's used in radar and sonar, 5G and Wi-Fi,\n Basically, any time a signal is processed, there's a good chance that a fast Fourier transform is involved. But on top of all this, the FFT was discovered by scientists trying to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. And if they had discovered it sooner,\n it may have put a stop to the nuclear arms race. You know, I always assumed that the nuclear arms race was inevitable. That once the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it was just unavoidable that all the\n other major powers would develop nukes. But maybe it wasn't. Because it was clear to everyone that nuclear weapons were game-changing. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima released a thousand times more energy than the biggest conventional explosive.\n So other countries were rightfully concerned. At the end of the war, Canada and the UK requested a meeting to discuss what would be done about nuclear weapons. And contrary to what I expected, the US was actually open to these discussions.\n They realized that they wouldn't be the only nation with nukes for long. So they offered to decommission all their nuclear weapons if other nations would pledge never to make them. This was known as the\n a Rook plan, and it proposed that an international body would control all radioactive materials on Earth, from mining to refining to using these materials for peaceful purposes, as in nuclear power generation. But the Soviets rejected the\n proposal. They saw it as just another ploy to maintain American nuclear dominance. And so the global nuclear arms race began. To develop new nuclear weapons required extensive testing, and most of it\n was done in remote places like the Arctic or the South Pacific Islands. The US also created a nuclear testing site in Nevada, the radioactive products of which blew across the country, so that outside of Japan, the people most adversely affected by American nuclear\n weapons were Americans themselves. The US soon graduated from fission weapons to thermonuclear bombs, which combined fission and fusion to release even more energy. They were as big a leap\n from the first atomic bombs, as those devices were from conventional explosives, a thousand times again more powerful. Annihilation of any life on earth is being brought within the range of technical possibilities.\n In 1954 at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific, the US tested a new thermonuclear design that used lithium deuteride as a fuel, and they expected the device, codenamed Shrimp, to release the energy of\n equivalent of 6 million tons of TNT. But they were wrong. It released two and a half times that due to unanticipated reactions with lithium-7.\n And as a result, more radioactive material was created and it rained down over a much larger area than planned. Residents of neighboring atolls were only evacuated three days later, suffering from radiation sickness. And further east, the 23 crew of\n Japanese fishing boat were caught in a flurry of radioactive white ash. And by that evening, they were suffering from acute radiation syndrome. One of the crew died from ensuing complications six months later.\n These events triggered public outcry against nuclear testing. The modern peace sign was designed in the 1950s by combining the semaphore letters for N and D, standing for nuclear\n nuclear disarmament. A number of world leaders called for a comprehensive test ban, no more testing of nuclear weapons by any state. And this call was actually taken seriously by the world's nuclear powers. They entered into negotiations at\n meetings with very literal names like the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests held in Geneva in 1958. And to show just how serious they were, they even stopped all testing during the negotiations, which is why\n 1959 is the only year in a long stretch when no nuclear weapons were detonated. But there is a big problem with negotiating a comprehensive test ban, which is, how do you know that the other side will hold up their end\n the bargain. The US worried that the Soviets would continue testing covertly and leapfrog them technologically, and the Soviets similarly distrusted the US. So to address these concerns, they convened the Conference of Experts to Study the\n of detecting violations of a possible agreement on suspension of nuclear tests. Seriously, that was the name. I am not making this up. Now detecting atmospheric tests\n was fairly straightforward. The radioactive isotopes they produce disperse in the atmosphere and can be detected thousands of kilometers away. Underwater tests produce distinctive sounds that travel efficiently around a kilometer below the surface of the ocean.\n These can be picked up by hydrophones. But underground tests are much harder to detect from afar because their radiation is mostly contained. And the Soviets refused to allow on-site compliance visits, which they regarded an\n espionage. And this is ultimately why when a test ban treaty was signed in 1963, it was only a partial ban. It banned testing underwater, in the atmosphere, and in space, places where compliance could be verified, but it\n didn't ban testing underground for the simple reason that it was almost impossible to verify compliance. But scientists had been trying to find a way to reliably detect underground detonations. Following the Geneva meeting, American and Soviet scientists formed\n a working group to discuss the issue. Their idea was to use seismometers located outside the countries where nukes were being tested to detect the faint ground vibrations caused by explosions. The problem was, how do you distinguish a nuclear\n test from an earthquake. Every day around the world, there are close to 300 earthquakes with a magnitude of 3 or greater. In addition, part of the purpose of detecting your adversary's tests is to spy on them, to know\n how big of an explosion they can make. But the seismometer signal depends not only on the yield of the device, but also on how deep it was buried. For a given yield, deeper explosions appear smaller. So scientists wanted\n method to reliably determine whether a given signal was a bomb or an earthquake and if it was a bomb how big it was and how deep it was buried. They knew that all this information was contained in the seismometer signal but it couldn't just be read off\n by looking at the squiggles. They needed to know how much of different frequencies were present, which meant they needed to take a Fourier transform. A Fourier transform is a way of decomposing a signal into pure sine waves.\n waves, each with its own amplitude and frequency, that add to make it up. This seems a bit like magic, since the sum of a set of sine waves can look arbitrarily complicated and nothing like its component parts. There are some\n elegant ways to understand how Fourier transforms work, shout out to the awesome video by 3blue1brown, but I want to take more of a brute force approach. If you want to know how much of a particular sine wave is in a signal, just multiply the signal by the sine wave\n at each point, and then add up the area under the curve. As a simple example, say our signal is just a sine wave with a certain frequency. But pretend we don't know that, and we're trying to figure out which sine waves add to make it up.\n Well, if you multiply this signal by a sine wave of an arbitrary frequency, the two waves are uncorrelated. You're just as likely to find places where they have the same sign, both positive or both negative, as where they have opposite signs. And therefore, when you\n apply them together, the area above the x-axis is equal to the area below the x-axis, so these areas add up to zero. Which means that frequency sine wave is not a part of your signal. And this will be true for almost all frequencies\n you could try, assuming you're looking over a long enough time frame. The only exception is if the frequency of the sine wave exactly matches that of the signal. Now, these waves are correlated, so their product is always positive, and\n so is the area under the curve. That indicates that this sine wave is part of our signal. And this trick works even if the signal is composed of a bunch of different frequencies. If the sine wave's frequency is one of the components of the signal, it will correlate\n And the size of this area tells you the relative amplitude of that frequency sine wave in the signal. Repeat this process for all frequencies of sine waves and you get the frequency spectrum. Essentially, what is the frequency spectrum?\n which frequencies are present and in what proportions. So far, I've only talked about sine waves, but if the signal is a cosine wave, then even if you multiply it by a sine wave of the exact same frequency, the\n area under the curve will be zero. So for each frequency we actually need to multiply by a sine wave AND a cosine wave and find the amplitudes for each. The ratio of these amplitudes indicates the phase of the signal, that is\n You can calculate these sine and cosine amplitudes separately, or you can use Euler's formula, so you only need to multiply your signal by one exponential term. Then the real part of the sum is\n the cosine amplitude and the imaginary part is the sine amplitude. In the American delegation at the Geneva meeting there was a physicist Richard Garwin and a mathematician John Tukey. They got into a debate with the Soviet delegation over which\n nations seismometers were superior. So Garwin simulated the responses of both countries' devices on a computer at CERN. The next day, everyone agreed there wasn't much difference. The real obstacle to\n Detecting underground explosions wasn't the accuracy of the seismometers, it was the vast amounts of computation required to Fourier transform the seismometer signals. Here's an example seismometer signal and its Fourier transform.\n Thus far, I've been thinking about signals as infinite continuous waves, and when you take their Fourier transform, you get an infinite continuous frequency spectrum. But real-world signals are not like that. They are finite and made up of individual samples,\n or data points. Even though a seismometer signal looks smooth and continuous, it doesn't record ground motion with infinite precision. There is some fundamental graininess to the data. So what you have is discrete, finite\n data. So you can't use the idealized Fourier transform. Instead, you have to perform something called a discrete Fourier transform. And one of the distinguishing features of a discrete Fourier transform is that the frequency\n spectrum is also discrete and finite. You can think of the frequencies as falling into a finite number of bins. And what determines the number and size of these bins is the number of samples in the signal and how closely spaced they are.\n For example, the more spaced out the samples are, the lower the maximum frequency you can measure, because the samples aren't close enough together to capture high frequency oscillations. The shorter the duration of the signal, the harder it is\n to tell similar frequencies apart, so this lowers the frequency resolution. The shorter the signal, the wider each frequency bin is. The lowest non-zero frequency you can effectively measure is one whose period\n is equal to the duration of the signal. The higher frequency bins are just integer multiples of this frequency, so they fit 2, 3, 4, and so on periods in the duration of the signal. The total number of frequency bins is\n is equal to the number of samples in the signal. So if the signal is made up of 8 samples, then the transform has 8 frequency bins, going from 0 up to 7 times the fundamental frequency. So let's do an example.\n Say we have a signal made up of 8 samples. Then the discrete Fourier transform will have 8 frequency bins. The first bin corresponds to a frequency of 0. Essentially, this measures if the signal is systematically shifting\n The second frequency bin?\n corresponds to the frequency that fits one period in the duration of the signal. So in this case, that corresponds to 1 Hz. You multiply each point by a sine wave of this frequency, and a cosine wave of this frequency, and\n separately add them up. For sine they add to zero, for cosine they add to four. Repeat the process for 2Hz, 3Hz, and so on up to 7Hz. You have the discrete Fourier\n of this really simple signal. Now this process works fine in principle and you could use it to calculate all discrete Fourier transforms, but the problem is it requires way too many calculations to complete one\n One discrete Fourier transform requires multiplying n data points by n different frequency waves, so n squared complex multiplications. This is doable for 8 samples, but if you had, say, a million samples,\n That would require a million squared, or one trillion calculations. At the speed of 1960s computers, that would take over three years to complete, all for a single transform.\n A million samples is admittedly more than you would need for a single seismic event, but to analyze tens of events per day from hundreds of seismometers, it would just be far too time consuming. And that's what gave scientists the impetus to look for a better way.\n The breakthrough came in 1963 at a meeting of the President's Science Advisory Committee. President John F. Kennedy was there, as were Garwin and Tukey, the physicist and mathematician from the Geneva meeting. Although they were discussing issues of national importance, like the Apollo\n and nuclear fallout shelters, the meeting was apparently pretty boring. Garwin observed Tukey doodling throughout. But what he was actually doing was working on discrete Fourier transforms. At the end of the meeting, Garwin asked Tukey\n Tukey what he had worked out. And he was shocked to learn that Tukey knew a way to compute discrete Fourier transforms with many fewer computations. It would mean that the calculation that would have taken over three years could be done in just 35 minutes.\n This has aptly become known as the Fast Fourier Transform. So here is how it works. Consider the example from before with eight samples. Each of those data points must be multiplied by the eight different frequency\n waves. Here I'm only showing cosines for simplicity. So you would expect this to require 8 times 8, or 64 complex multiplications. But, due to the periodic nature of sinusoids, these waves of different frequencies\n overlap in a predictable way. For example, at the middle data point, all of the four odd frequencies have the same value, and all of the four even frequencies have the same value as well. So instead of doing eight multiplications,\n you only need to do 2. And this sort of duplication occurs at the other data points as well. So instead of performing 64 calculations, you need only 24. Now that might seem like a small improvement, but it's the difference\n between a calculation that scales as n the number of samples squared versus one that scales as n log base 2 of n, which means the bigger the data set, the greater the savings. A signal with a thousand samples would require a hundred\n But how do you know which calculations are redundant?\n split them into even and odd indexed points. You still need to multiply each of these by the 8 different frequency waves. But now let's look only at the even points and compare the first 4 frequencies to the second 4 frequencies.\n frequencies, and what you find is that in each case at the location of the samples, the values of the two sine waves are the same. A similar pattern can be observed for the odd index points, except the values of one\n sine wave are the negative of the other. More generally, they're related by a complex number. But what this means is that you don't have to do all the multiplications for the second half of the frequencies. Once you've calculated the\n odd and even sums for the lower half of the frequencies, you can reuse these values to find the upper half. So you've effectively cut the number of calculations required in half. But that's only a factor of\n 2, how do you get down to n log base 2 of n? Well, you repeat the same trick. Split the samples again into even and odd points, and then again repeatedly until you're down to single data points.\n At each split, you can exploit the symmetries of sinusoidal functions to cut the number of calculations in half. And that is how the Fast Fourier Transform reduces n-squared calculations down to n-log-n.\n However, anyone takes a Fourier transform, it's almost always done as a fast Fourier transform. Garwin approached an IBM researcher, James Cooley, to program a computer to run the FFT algorithm, but he didn't tell him the reason was to\n detect underground Soviet nuclear tests. He said it was to work out the spins in a crystal of helium-3. Cooley and Tukey published the algorithm in a seminal 1965 paper and its use immediately took off. But it was too late\n to secure a comprehensive nuclear test ban. By that time the UK, France and China had joined the Soviet Union and the US as nuclear powers. And the partial test ban treaty, far from de-escalated\n the nuclear arms race just sent it underground. The thinking was if you were only allowed to test underground then you better be testing extensively so as not to fall behind all the other nuclear states. So from 1963 1500\n 100 nuclear weapons were detonated. That's roughly one a week for 30 years. This testing facilitated the construction of an absurd number of nukes. At the peak in the mid-1980s, 70,000 nuclear warheads were in\n existence. Total expenditure on nukes in the 20th century is estimated at around $10 trillion each for the US and the Soviet Union adjusting for inflation. If only scientists had been confident in their ability to remotely detect\n underground tests in the early 1960s, then a comprehensive test ban could have been reached, stopping the nuclear arms race before it really got going. To check how realistic this is, I asked Richard Garwin himself.\n But that would have required an earlier discovery of the fast Fourier transform. And as luck would have it, it was discovered earlier.\n later, but then forgotten. All the way back in 1805, mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss was studying the newly discovered asteroids of Pallas, Ceres, and Juno. To determine the orbit of Juno, Gauss devised a novel approach to harmonic\n analysis and he jotted it down in his notes but later used a different method and he never thought to publish that first insight. Today we can see that Gauss had figured out the discrete Fourier transform before Joseph Fourier himself published it in 1806.\n and he had developed the same fast Fourier transform algorithm as Cooley and Tukey a century and a half earlier. The reason his breakthrough was not widely adopted was because it only appeared after his death in volume 3 of his collection.\n works and it was written with non-standard notation in a 19th century version of Latin. What do you think would have happened if Gauss had realized the significance of his discovery and had published it in a way that others could understand? With our modern network\n of seismometers and computing and the fast Fourier transform, today we have the ability to detect magnitude 3 events, which correspond to a 1 kiloton or so explosion basically anywhere on Earth. Following Cooley and Tukey's paper,\n However, the use of FFTs exploded, and they are the basis for most compression algorithms, like the ones that allow you to watch and listen to this video. Here's how the Fast Fourier Transform allows you to compress an image. You take the pixel brightness\n values for each row of an image and perform a fast Fourier transform. So essentially you're figuring out what frequencies are present in the brightness values of the rows of an image. Here brightness represents the magnitude\n of each frequency component, and the color represents the phase, how shifted that frequency is to the left or the right. And then, you perform another FFT for the columns of pixels. It doesn't matter if you do the rows or columns first,\n What you need is a two-dimensional FFT of the original image. For almost all real-world images, you find that a lot of the values in the transform are close to zero. I've taken the log of the transform values\n so you can see them, but if I don't, then it's clear most of the values, especially toward the edges, are very small. These correspond to high frequencies. And what this means is that you can throw out a lot of the information in the transformed image.\n say 99% of it. But when you invert that result, you still get a fairly good representation of the original image. So on your computer, most of the images will be saved in this form as a two-dimensional fast-for-read\n transform. There are so many applications for FFTs, from solving differential equations, to radar and sonar, studying crystal structures, wifi and\n 5G, basically all kinds of signal processing use FFTs. And that's why mathematician Gilbert Strang called the FFT the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime. If only it had become more widely adopted after Gauss\n Now, I don't think Gauss could ever have imagined how important the FFT would be.\n Just as most people don't think about the cumulative impact of their life's work. You know in an average career you work 40 hours a week 50 weeks a year for 40 years and that works out to 80,000 hours. It means that you\n your career might be your biggest opportunity to make a difference in the world. So what do you want to do with all that time?

            "transcription": "This is a video about the most famous problem in game theory. Problems of this sort pop up everywhere, from nations locked in conflict to roommates doing the dishes. Even game shows have been based around this concept. Figuring out the best strategy\n The word strategy can mean the difference between life and death, war and peace, flourishing and the destruction of the planet. And in the mechanics of this game, we may find the very source of one of the most unexpected phenomena in nature.\n On the 3rd of September 1949, an American weather monitoring plane collected air samples over Japan. In those samples, they found traces of radioactive material.\n The Navy quickly collected and tested rainwater samples from their ships and bases all over the world. They also detected small amounts of Serium-141 and Yttrium-91. But these isotopes have\n half-lives of one or two months, so they must have been produced recently. And the only place they could have come from was a nuclear explosion. But the US hadn't performed any tests that year, so the only possible conclusion\n was that the Soviet Union had figured out how to make a nuclear bomb. This was the news the Americans had been dreading. Their military supremacy achieved through the Manhattan Project was quickly fading.\n Some thought their best course of action was to launch an unprovoked nuclear strike against the Soviets while they were still ahead.\n In the words of Navy Secretary Matthews, to become,\n say today at 5 o'clock, I say why not at 1 o'clock? Something needed to be done about nuclear weapons and fast. But what? In 1950, the Rand Corporation, a US-based\n Tank was studying this question, and as part of this research they turned to game theory. That same year, two mathematicians at Rand had invented a new game, one which, unbeknownst to them at the time, closely resembled the U.S. Soviet\n conflict. This game is now known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, so let's play a game. A banker with a chest full of gold coins invites you and another player to play against each other. You each get two choices. You can cooperate,\n or you can defect. If you both cooperate, you each get three coins. If one of you cooperates but the other defects, then the one who defected gets five coins and the other gets nothing. And if you both defect, then you each\n Each get a coin. The goal of the game is simple, to get as many coins as you can. So, what would you do? Suppose your opponent cooperates, then you could also cooperate and get three coins.\n Or, you could defect and get 5 coins instead. So, you are better off defecting. But what if your opponent defects instead? Well, you could cooperate and get no coins, or you could defect and at least get\n Now, if your opponent is also rational, they will reach the same conclusion and therefore also defect.\n When you both act rationally, you both end up in the suboptimal situation, getting one coin each, when you could have gotten three instead. In the case of the US and Soviet Union, this led both countries to develop huge nuclear arsenal\n of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons each, more than enough to destroy each other many times over. But since both countries had nukes, neither could use them. And both countries spent around 10 trillion dollars\n developing these weapons. Both would have been better off if they had cooperated and agreed not to develop this technology further. But since they both acted in their own best interest, they ended up in a situation where everyone was worse off.\n The Prisoner's Dilemma is one of the most famous games in game theory. Thousands and thousands of papers have been published on versions of this game. In part, that's because it pops up everywhere. Impales?\n living in between African woodlands and savannas are prone to catching ticks, which can lead to infectious diseases, paralysis, even death. So it's important for impalas to remove ticks, and they do this by grooming. But they can't reach all the\n Now, grooming someone else comes at a cost. It costs saliva, electrolytes, time, and attention, all vital resources under the hot African sun, where a person's body is not protected.\n predator could strike at any moment. So for the other Impala, it would be best not to pay this cost. But then again, it too will need help grooming. So all Impalas face a choice, should they groom each other or not. In other words,\n Well, if they only interact once, then the rational solution is always to defect. That other impala is never going to help you, so why bother? But the thing about a lot of problems?\n is that they're not a single prisoner's dilemma. Impalas see each other day after day and the same situation keeps happening over and over again. So that changes the problem. Because instead of playing the prisoner's dilemma just once, you're\n We're now playing it many, many times, and if I defect now, then my opponent will know that I defected, and they can use that against me in the future. So what is the best strategy in this repeated game?\n That is what Robert Axelrod, a political scientist, wanted to find out. So in 1980, he decided to hold a computer tournament. He invited some of the world's leading game theorists from many different subjects.\n Axelrod called these programs strategies. Each strategy would face off against every other strategy and against a copy of itself. And each matchup would\n go for 200 rounds. That's important, and we'll come back to it. Now, Axelrod used points instead of coins, but the payoffs were the same. The goal of the tournament was to win as many points as possible, and in the end, the whole tournament was\n repeated five times over to ensure the success was robust and not just a fluke. Axelrod gave an example of a simple strategy. It would start each game by cooperating and only defect after its opponent had defected twice\n a row. In total, Axelrod received 14 strategies and he added a 15th called Random, which just randomly cooperates or defects 50% of the time. All strategies were loaded onto a single computer, where\n they faced off against each other. One of the strategies was called Freedman. It starts off by cooperating, but if its opponent defects just once, it will keep defecting for the remainder of the game. Another strategy was called Joss.\n It also starts by cooperating, but then it just copies what the other player did on the last move. Then around 10% of the time, Joss gets sneaky and defects. There was also a rather elaborate strategy called Grass Camp. This strategy works the same\n Same as Joss, but instead of defecting probabilistically, GrassCamp defects in the 50th round, to try and probe the strategy of its opponent and see if it can take advantage of any weaknesses. The most elaborate strategy was Name Withheld, with 77\n lines of code. After all the games were played, the results were tallied up and the leaderboard established.\n by cooperating, and then it copies exactly what its opponent did in the last move. So it would follow cooperation with cooperation and defection with defection. But only once, if its opponent goes back to cooperating, so does tip for tat.\n When Tit for Tat played against Freedman, both started by cooperating, and they kept cooperating, both ending up with perfect scores for complete cooperation. When Tit for Tat played against Joss, they too started by cooperating, but then on the sixth move,\n just affected. This sparked a series of back and forth defections, a sort of echo effect.\n this weird program throws in a second unprovoked defection, now it's really bad because now both programs are going to defect on each other for the rest of the game. And that's also like some of the things that we're seeing in politics today and in international\n As a result of these mutual retaliations, both Tit for Tat and Joss did poorly. But because Tit for Tat managed to cooperate with enough other strategies, it still won the tournament.\n Where's Professor Axelrod? Hey, hey, there's Steven Stewart! What a treat this is! I imagined initially it'd be sort of like computer chess where you need a pretty complicated program to play a sophisticated game.\n In fact, it was not like that at all. It was the simplest strategy that did the best. So I analyzed how that happened. Axelrod found that all the best performing strategies, including tip for tap, shared four qualities.\n First, they were all nice, which just means they are not the first to defect. So tit-for-tat is a nice strategy. It can defect, but only in retaliation. The opposite of nice is nasty. That's a strategy that defects first.\n So Joss is nasty. Out of the 15 strategies in the tournament, 8 were nice and 7 nasty. The top 8 strategies were all nice. And even the worst performing nice strategy still far outscored the best performing.\n The second important quality was being forgiving. A forgiving strategy is one that can retaliate, but it doesn't hold a grudge. So tit-for-tat is a forgiving strategy. It retaliates when its opponent defects, but\n doesn't let defections from before the last round influence its current decisions. Friedman, on the other hand, is maximally unforgiving.\n This conclusion, that it pays to be nice and forgiving, came as a shock to the experts. Many had tried to be tricky\n and create subtle nasty strategies to beat their opponent and eke out an advantage. But they all failed. Instead, in this tournament, nice guys finished first. Now, tit for tat is quite forgiving, but it's possible to be even more forgiving.\n Axelrod's sample strategy only defects after its opponent defected twice in a row. It was tipped for two tats. Now, that might sound overly generous, but when Axelrod ran the numbers, he found that if anyone had submitted the sample strategy, they\n would have won the tournament.\n So he announced a second tournament where everything would be the same except for one change, the number of rounds per game. See, in the first tournament, each game\n game lasted precisely 200 rounds. And that is important, because if you know when the last round is, then there's no reason to cooperate in that round, so you're better off defecting. Of course, your opponent should reason the same, and so they should also defect in the\n last round. But if you both anticipate defection in the last round, then there's no reason for you to cooperate in the second to last round, or the round before that, or before that, and so on all the way to the very first round.\n It was a very important thing that the players didn't know exactly how long they were going to be playing. They knew on average it would be 200 rounds, but there was a random number generator that prevented them from knowing with certainty. Yeah, if you're not sure when it ends.\n For this second tournament, Axelrod received 62 entries and again added random. The contestants had gotten the results and analysis from\n first tournament and could use this information to their advantage. This created two camps. Some thought that clearly being nice and forgiving were winning qualities, so they submitted nice and forgiving strategies. One even submitted tit for two tats.\n The second camp anticipated that others would be nice and extra forgiving. Therefore, they submitted nasty strategies to try to take advantage of those that were extra forgiving. One such strategy was called Tester. It would defect on the first move\n to see how its opponent reacted. If it retaliated, Tester would apologize and play tit for tat for the remainder of the game. If it didn't retaliate, Tester would defect every other move after that. But again, being\n nasty didn't pay. And once again tit for tat was the most effective. Nice strategies again did much better. In the top 15 only one was not nice. Similarly in the bottom 15 only\n After the second tournament, Axelrod identified the other qualities that distinguished the better performing strategies. The third is being retaliatory, which means if your opponent defects, strike back immediately.\n Don't be a pushover. Always cooperate is a total pushover, and so it's very easy to take advantage of. Tit for tat, on the other hand, is very hard to take advantage of. The last quality that Axelrod identified is being clear.\n programs that were too opaque, that were too similar to a random program, you couldn't figure them out because they were so complicated. It was very hard to establish any pattern of trust with a program like that because you couldn't figure out what it was doing.\n I mean, the other programs it was playing couldn't figure them out. And so they would end up more or less defaulting to thinking every turn is like the last time I'm going to see you, so I might as well defect. What to me is mind-blowing.\n about this is that these four principles, being nice, forgiving, provokable, and clear, is a lot like the morality that has evolved around the world that is often summarized as an eye for an eye.\n What's interesting is that while Tit for two tats would have won the first two\n This highlights an important fact. In the repeated prisoners dilemma, there is no single best strategy. The strategy that performs best always depends on the other strategies it's interacting with.\n For example, if you put tit for tat in an environment with only the ultimate bullies of always defect, then tit for tat comes in last.\n So he ran a simulation where successful strategies in one generation would see their numbers grow and unsuccessful ones would see their numbers drop. In this simulation, the worst\n First performing strategies quickly shrink and go extinct, while the top performing strategies become more common. Harrington, the only nasty strategy in the top 15, first grew quickly, but then as the strategies it was preying on went extinct,\n This shows a main benefit of this simulation, because it tests how well a strategy does with other successful strategies.\n Now, this process may sound similar to evolution, but there is a subtle difference.\n which is that in this case there are no mutations. So it's actually an ecological simulation. But what if the world you started in was different? Imagine a world that is a really nasty place to live, more or less populated with players that always defect.\n Except there's a little cluster of tit-for-tat players that live in some kind of nucleus. And they get to play with each other a lot because they're geographically sequestered. They will start building up a lot of points and also, because that translates into offspring, they'll\n start to take over the population. So, in fact, Axelrod showed that a little island of cooperation can emerge and spread and eventually will take over the world, which is fantastic. How\n can cooperation emerge in a population of players who are self-interested, who are not trying to be good because they're good-hearted? You don't have to be altruistic. You could be looking out for number one, for\n yourself and your own interests, and yet cooperation can still emerge. Some argue that this could explain how we went from a world full of completely selfish organisms...\n where every organism only cared about themselves, to one where cooperation emerged and flourished. From impalas grooming each other to fish cleaning sharks. Many life forms experience conflicts similar to the prisoner's dilemma.\n But because they don't interact just once, both can be better off by cooperating. And this doesn't require trust or conscious thought either, because the strategy could be encoded in DNA.\n As long as it performs better than the other strategies, it can take over a population. Axelrod's insights were applied to areas like evolutionary\n biology and international conflicts. But there was one aspect that his original tournaments didn't cover. What happens if there is a little bit of random error in the game? Some noise in the system? For example, one player tries to cooperate but it\n comes across as a defection. Little errors like this happen in the real world all the time. Like in 1983, the Soviet satellite-based early warning system detected the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from the US. But the US hadn't launched\n But this example shows the potential costs of a\n signal error, and the importance of studying the effects of noise on those strategies.\n matters, obviously. And as you mentioned that this came up in the Cold War, I mean it could actually be life and death of the whole planet, we could annihilate human civilization. So these are not games in any kind of trivial sense, it's just the term that is used by\n mathematicians and theorists. When tit-for-tat plays against itself in a noisy environment, both start off by cooperating. But if a single cooperation is perceived as a defection, then the other tit-for-tat retaliates and it sets off a chain\n of alternating retaliations, and if another cooperation is perceived as a defection, then the rest of the game is constant mutual defection. Therefore, in the long run, both would only get a third of the points they would get in a perfect environment.\n goes from performing very well to performing poorly. So how do you solve this? Well, you need a reliable way to break out of these echo effects. And one way to do this is by playing tip for tap, but with around 10% more\n or forgiveness.\n We also ran the tournament with noise and generosity, and that did quite well. My favorite example is Tiff\n I mean, think about it. By design, all they can do is lose or draw. And yet, when the results of all interactions are tallied up, they come out ahead of\n of all other strategies. Similarly, always defect can never lose a game, it can only draw or win. But overall, it performs extremely poorly. This highlights a common misconception, because\n For many people, when they think about winning, they think they need to beat the other person. In games like chess or poker, this is true, since one person's gain is necessarily another person's loss. So these games are zero sum.\n zero summed. To win, you don't need to get your reward from the other player. Instead, you can get it from the banker. Only in real life, the banker is the world. It is literally everything around you. It is just up to us to find those win-win\n situations and then work together to unlock those rewards. Cooperation pays, even among rivals. From 1950 to 1986, the US and Soviet Union had trouble cooperating, and both kept developing nukes.\n But then, from the late 80s onwards, they started reducing their nuclear stockpiles. They too had learned how to resolve conflict. Rather than making an agreement to abolish all nuclear arms at once and essentially turning it into a single\n prisoners dilemma, they would disarm slowly a small number of nukes each year, and then they'd check each other to see that they had both cooperated, and then repeat the year after, and the year after that, all along checking to ensure\n In the more than 40 years since Axelrod's tournaments, researchers have continued to study which strategies perform best in a variety of environments. In doing so, they varied everything from payoff structures to strategies to\n errors and more. Some even allow the strategies to mutate. While tit for tat or generous tit for tat doesn't always come out on top, Axelrod's main takeaways still hold. Be nice, forgiving, but don't be\n a pushover. Can I ask you, why did Anatole Rappaport submit Tip for Tat? Well, the reason was because I asked him to.\n He wrote saying, yeah, I'm willing to do that. But I just want to be clear that I'm not sure that this is really such a good idea. He was a peace researcher. And I think his own inclinations were to be much more forgiving.\n What I find fascinating is that one of the main things that sets life apart from non-living things is that life gets to make decisions. We get to make choices. Choices that don't only change our future,\n but also the future of those we interact with.\n Using the right strategy matters.\n But figuring out the best strategy isn't easy. It requires critical thinking and innovative solutions, like Axelrod's tournaments.

            "transcription": "A portion of this video was sponsored by LastPass. This video is about a pattern people thought was impossible and a material that wasn't supposed to exist. The story begins over 400 years ago in Prague.\n I'm now in Prague in the Czech Republic, which is perhaps my favorite European city that I've visited so far. I'm going to visit the Kepler Museum because he's one of the most famous scientists who lived and worked around Prague. I want to tell you five things about Johannes Kepler.\n that are essential to our story. Number one, Kepler is most famous for figuring out that the shapes of planetary orbits are ellipses. But before he came to this realization, he invented a model of the solar system in which\n the planets were on nested spheres, separated by the platonic solids. What are the platonic solids? Well, they are objects where all of the faces are identical, and all of the vertices are identical.\n which means you can rotate them through some angle and they look the same as they did before. So the cube is an obvious example. Then you also have the tetrahedron, the octahedron,\n the dodecahedron, which has 12 pentagonal sides, and the icosahedron, which has 20 sides. And that's it. There are just five platonic solids, which was convenient for Kepler because in his day they only knew\n about six planets, so this allowed him to put a unique platonic solid between each of the planetary spheres. Essentially, he used them as spacers. He carefully selected the order of the platonic solids so that the distances between planets would\n match astronomical observations as closely as possible. He had this deep abiding belief that there was some geometric regularity in the universe. And of course there is, just not this.\n extended to more practical questions like how do you stack cannonballs so they take up the least space on a ship's deck? By 1611 Kepler had an answer. Hexagonal close packing and the face centered cubic arrangement are both equivalently\n and optimally efficient, with cannonballs occupying about 74% of the volume they take up. Now this might seem like the obvious way to stack spheres, I mean it is the way that oranges are stacked in the supermarket, but Kepler hadn't proved it, he just\n stated it as fact, which is why this became known as Kepler's conjecture. Now it turns out he was right, but it took around 400 years to prove it. The formal proof was only published in the journal Form of Mathematics in 2017.\n Three. Kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet called Deneva Sixangula on the Six-Cornered Snowflake in which he wondered,\n In Kepler's day, there was no real theory of atoms or molecules.\n or how they self-arrange into crystals. But Kepler seemed to be on the verge of understanding this. I mean, he speculates about the smallest natural unit of a liquid like water, essentially a water molecule, and how these tiny units could\n stack together mechanically to form the hexagonal crystal, not unlike the hexagonal close-packed cannonballs. Kepler knew that regular hexagons can cover a flat surface perfectly with no\n gaps. In mathematical jargon we say the hexagon tiles the plane periodically. You know that a tiling is periodic if you can duplicate a portion of it and continue the pattern only through translation, with no rotations or reflections.\n Periodic tilings can also have rotational symmetry. A rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry because if you rotate it 180 degrees, one half turn, the pattern looks the same as it did before. Equilateral triangles have threefold symmetry.\n symmetry. Squares have 4-fold symmetry, and hexagons have 6-fold symmetry. But those are the only symmetries you can have. 2, 3, 4, and 6. There is no 5-fold symmetry.\n fold symmetry. Regular pentagons do not tile the plane. But that didn't stop Kepler from trying. See this pattern right here? He published it in his book Harmonikis Mundi, or Harmony of the World. It has a certain\n 5-fold symmetry, but not exactly, and it's not entirely clear how you would continue this pattern to tile the whole plane. There are an infinite number of shapes that can tile the plane periodically.\n periodically. The regular hexagon can only tile the plane periodically. There are also an infinite number of shapes that can tile the plane periodically or non-periodically. For example, isosceles triangles can tile the plane periodically, but if you\n If you rotate a pair of triangles, well then the pattern is no longer perfectly periodic. A sphinx tile can join with another, rotate it at 180 degrees, and tile the plane periodically. But a different arrangement of these same\n tiles is non-periodic. This raises the question, are there some tiles that can only tile the plane non-periodically? Well in 1961, Hao Wang was studying multicolored square tiles. The rule\n were touching edges must be the same color and you can't rotate or reflect tiles, only slide them around. Now the question was, if you're given a set of these tiles, can you tell if they will tile the plane? Wang's conjecture was\n that if they can tile the plane, well they can do so periodically. But it turned out Wang's conjecture was false. His student Robert Berger found a set of 20,426 tiles that could tile the plane\n but only non-periodically. Think about that for a second. Here we have a finite set of tiles, okay, it's a large number, but it's finite and it can tile all the way out to infinity without ever repeating the same\n pattern. There's no way even to force them to tile periodically. And a set of tiles like this that can only tile the plane non-periodically is called an aperiodic tiling. And mathematicians wanted to know\n No, were there aperiodic tilings that required fewer tiles? Well, Robert Berger himself found a set with only 104. Donald Knuth got the number down to 92. And then in 1969, you had Raphael Robinson, who came\n up with six tiles, just six, that could tile the entire plane without ever repeating. Then along came Roger Penrose, who would ultimately get the number down to two.\n with a pentagon. He added other pentagons around it and of course noticed the gaps. But this new shape could fit within a larger pentagon, which gave Penrose an idea. What if he took the original pentagons and broke them?\n them into smaller pentagons. Now some of the gaps start connecting up into rhombus shapes. Other gaps have three spikes. But Penrose didn't stop there. He subdivided the pentagons again. Now some of the gaps are\n large enough that you can use pentagons to fill in part of them. And the remaining holes you're left with are just rhombuses, stars, and a fraction of a star that Penrose calls a justice cap. You can keep subdividing indefinitely and you will only ever find\n These shapes. So with just these pieces, you can tile the plane aperiodically with an almost five-fold symmetry. The fifth thing about Johannes Kepler is that if you take his pentagon pattern,\n and you overlay it on top of Penrose's, the two match up perfectly. Once Penrose had his pattern, he found ways to simplify the tiles. He distilled the geometry down to just two\n tiles, a thick rhombus and a thin rhombus. The rules for how they can come together can be enforced by bumps and notches or by matching colors. The rules ensure that these two single tiles can only tile the plane non-periodally.\n periodically. Just two tiles go all the way out to infinity without ever repeating. Now one way to see this is to print up two copies of the same Penrose pattern and one on a transparency and overlay them on top of\n each other. Now the resulting interference you get is called a moire pattern. Where it is dark the patterns are not aligned. You can see there are also some light spots and that's where the patterns do match up and as I\n rotate around you can see the light spots move in and get smaller and then at a certain point they move out and get bigger. And what I want to do is try to enlarge one of these bright spots and see\n how big of a matching section I can find. Oh yes, yes! It's like all of a sudden everything is illuminated. I love it!\n So these patterns are perfectly matching up here, here, here, here, and here, but not along these radial lines. And that is why they look dark. So what this shows us is that you can't ever match any section perfectly to one\n beneath it there will always be some difference. So my favorite Penrose pattern is actually made out of these two shapes which are called kites and darts. They\n have these very particular angles and the way they're meant to match up is based on these two curves. You can see there's a curve on each piece and so you have to connect them so that the curves are continuous and that's the rule that allows you to build\n an aperiodic tiling from these two pieces. So I laser cut thousands of these pieces and I'm gonna try to put them together and make a huge Penrose tiling.\n Oh man, come on. If you stare at a pattern of kites and darts, you'll start to notice all kinds of regularities like stars and suns.\n look closer and they don't quite repeat in the way you'd expect them to. These two tiles create an ever-changing pattern that extends out to infinity without repeating. Does this mean they're\n There is only one pattern of kites and darts, and every picture that we see is just a portion of that overall singular pattern. Well, the answer is no. There are actually an uncanny\n an uncountably infinite number of different patterns of kites and darts that tile the entire plane. And it gets weirder. If you were on any of those tilings, you wouldn't be able to tell which one it is.\n I mean, you might try to look further and further out, gather more and more data, but it's futile because any finite region of one of these tilings appears infinitely many times in all of the other versions of those tilings.\n me wrong, those tilings are also different in an infinite number of ways, but it's impossible to tell that unless you could see the whole pattern, which is impossible. There's this kind of paradox to Penrose tiling\n where there's an uncountable infinity of different versions, but just by looking at them, you could never tell them apart.\n What if we count up all the kites and darts in this pattern? Well I get 440 kites and 272 darts. Does that ratio ring any bells? Well if you divide one by the other you get 1.61\n 18. That is the golden ratio. So why does the golden ratio appear in this pattern? Well, as you know, it contains a kind of fivefold symmetry, and of all the irrational\n constants the golden ratio phi is the most five-ish of the constants. I mean you can express the golden ratio as 0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5 times 0.5. The golden ratio is\n also heavily associated with pentagons. I mean the ratio of the diagonal to an edge is the golden ratio and the kite and dart pieces themselves are actually sections of pentagons, same with the rhombuses. So they actually have the golden\n ratio built right into their construction.\n could be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers, the number of kites to darts in each periodic segment. And it goes deeper. If you draw on the tiles not curves, but these particular straight lines, well now when you put the pattern together,\n you see something interesting. They all connect up perfectly into straight lines. There are five sets of parallel lines. This is a kind of proof of the fivefold symmetry of the pattern.\n But it is not perfectly regular. Take a look at any one set of parallel lines. You'll notice there are two different spacings, call them long and short. From the bottom we have long, short, long, short, long, short, long, short, long, short, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long\n Long, long, wait, that breaks the pattern. These gaps don't follow a periodic pattern either. But count up the number of longs and shorts in any section. Here I get 13 shorts and 21 longs.\n and you have the Fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 and so on and the ratio of one Fibonacci number to the previous one approaches the\n golden ratio. Now the question Penrose faced from other scientists was, could there be a physical analogue for these patterns? Do they occur in nature, perhaps in crystal structure?\n Penrose thought that was unlikely. The very nature of a crystal is that it is made up of repeating units. Just as the fundamental symmetries of the shapes that tile the plane had been worked out much earlier, the basic unit cells that compose all crystals\n were well established. There are 14 of them, and no one had ever seen a crystal that failed to fit one of these patterns. And there was another problem. Crystals are built by putting atoms and molecules together locally, whereas penrose\n tiling seems to require some sort of long range coordination. Take this pattern for example. You could put a dart over here and continue to tile out to infinity, no problems. Or you could put a\n kite over here on the other side again no problems but if you place the kite and dart in here simultaneously well then this pattern will not work.\n You can keep tiling for a while, but when you get to somewhere around here well It's not gonna work. You can put a dart in there which completes the pattern nicely But then you get this really awkward shape there, which is actually\n actually the shape of another dart, but if you put that one in there, then the lines don't match up. The pattern doesn't work. So how could this work as a crystal? I mean, both of these tiles obey the local rules, but in the long term,\n just don't work.\n like to form icosahedrons. But this was known to be the most forbidden shape because it is full of five-fold symmetries. So the question they posed was how big can these icosahedrons get? They thought maybe 10 atoms or a hundred\n atoms, but inspired by Penrose-Thylings, they designed a new kind of structure, a 3D analog of Penrose-Thylings now known as a quasicrystal. And they simulated how X-rays would diffract off such a structure, and they found a pattern with ring\n of 10 points reflecting the fivefold symmetry. Just a few hundred kilometers away, completely unaware of their work, another scientist Dan Schectman created this flaky material from aluminum and manganese and when he scattered electron\n off his material, this is the picture he got. It almost perfectly matches the one made by Steinhardt. So if Pinaro's tilings require long\n range coordination, then how do you possibly make quasicrystals? Well, I was talking to Paul Steinhardt about this and he told me if you just use the matching rules on the edges, those rules are not strong enough and if you apply them\n locally you run into problems like this you misplace tiles but he said if you have rules for the vertices the way the vertices can connect with each other those rules are strong enough locally so that you never make a mistake and the pattern can\n can go on to infinity. One of the seminal papers on quasicrystals was called Deneva Quinquangula on the pentagonal snowflake in a shout out to Kepler. Now, not everyone was delighted at the announcement of\n Quasicrystals, a material that up until then people thought totally defied the laws of nature. Double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling famously remarked, there are no quasicrystals, only quasiscientists. Burr.\n But Schectman got the last laugh. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2011. And quasicrystals have since been grown with beautiful dodecahedral shapes. They are currently being explored for applications from\n non-stick electrical insulation and cookware to ultra durable steel. And the thing about this whole story that fascinates me the most is what exists that we just can't perceive because it's considered impossible. I mean the symmetries of regular geometric\n shapes seemed so obvious and certain that no one thought to look beyond them. That is, until Penrose. And what we found are patterns that are both beautiful and counterintuitive, and materials that existed all along that we just\n couldn't see for what they really are.\n Number one, many of you have signed up so you don't have to remember your passwords anymore or worry about getting locked out of your accounts.

Can I shake your hand? I love the thought you're putting into this. 37? No, you are kidding me! Are you real? Yeah, why? Did we ask you this already?\n Random number between 1 to 100. 37. 37, oh my gosh, yes! Name a random number between 1 and 100. 37. Are you kidding me? Why? It's a good number, I guess.\n Where did that come from? So what's going on? Well, people are actually really bad at selecting things randomly. In fact, when asked to pick a color and a number, people reliably select\n black, blue, and seven the most across dozens of different cultures. Psychologists have a name for this pattern, the blue seven phenomenon. And when picking a random number between 1 and 100, it has long been suggested that the equivalent of the blue\n 37 is the number 37. My producer Emily and I spoke to hundreds of people to test this theory. The most common answer was 7, but maybe that's because people just expected that we'd ask them for numbers between 1 and 10. The most common\n digit number really was 37, much to our surprise. So we decided to embark on the biggest investigation ever on the number 37.\n And it took us to some unexpected places.\n Apparently, people choose\n 37 so reliably that there's even a widespread professional magic trick that relies entirely on getting an audience member to just pick 37 out of thin air. It's called the 37 force. I'm gonna ask you to think of a number in a moment, okay? It's a\n Two digit number, it's less than 50. Both numbers are odd but different. You could have 19, 17 or 15, but not 11 because you see both numbers are the same, one and one next to one another. Are you ready? One, two and three.\n In the famous Stanford-MIT jargon file, the origin of hackerslang, 37 is given as the random number of choice for computer programmers.\n of people are polled to pick a random number between 1 and 100, the most commonly chosen number is 37. The thing is, no formal polls on this actually exist. The best we found was a Reddit poll of 1,380.\n 80 people from four years ago. And the most popular number was 69. But after that, the winning number was 37. But we can do better than a sample size of just a thousand people. So we conducted the largest\n random number survey ever. In a community post three weeks ago, we asked people to pick a random number between 1 and 100. We received 200,000 responses. Here are the results as they came in.\n It's fascinating to watch how consistent these supposedly random numbers are. From 10,000 to 100,000, all the way up to 200,000 respondents. The distribution barely changes\n changes, suggesting that people from all around the world think about random numbers in a particular way, and it is decidedly not random. Ignoring the extremes of the scale because people were primed\n by the numbers 1 and 100 in the question itself, and ignoring 42 and 69 because they're not random, there are a few numbers that stand out, which we seem to regard as more random than the rest. 7, 73,\n 77, and 37. Then we asked people to pick the number they thought the fewest others would pick. The goal was to get rid of favorite or lucky numbers and give truly random selections. And here,\n the results were even clearer. Again, ignoring the very extremes and 50 in the middle, the most selected numbers were far and away 73 and 37, which were nearly tied. The actual least picked\n number in the first question was 90, followed by 30, 40, 70, 80, and 60. Multiples of 10 apparently don't seem that random. The most picked overall numbers, ignoring the outliers, were 73 and 37.\n Ironically, all this evidence points to 37 and its inversion, 73, as not being random at all. So why does everyone pick them? Well, one argument is that this is just how people perceive randomness.\n 37 does that feel random to you? Yeah? Yeah, 50 wouldn't be random. No, no, it'd be too Yeah, yeah, it's too central. I think people think that even numbers are less random than odd numbers\n numbers. This is backed up by the fact that every one of the top numbers in our survey consisted of 3s and 7s. In fact, 3 and 7 were the most selected\n digits on both questions. But there's also a mathematical case for humanity's number of choice. Because it's not just odd numbers, but specifically primes which feel like the most random numbers. Notice how we\n ignore odds ending in fives, or how something like 39 still feels a little less random than 37. Primes feel random for at least two reasons. First, they don't appear as much in our lives.\n counts, fruit boxes, square footage, we live in a composite world with multiple dimensions that multiply together, so we just don't see primes much past the single digits. Second, we don't have a formula for primes. If you have a\n number and you want to find the next one, you have no choice but to check every number until you find a prime. The closest thing we have to a formula is the prime number theorem, which gives the approximation that the nth prime number occurs around n times natural log event.\n For example, the thousandth prime number should be around 6908, and it's close, but certainly not exact. So primes essentially occur at random. But of all the primes\n Because 37 has reason to stand out. If we were to find the prime factors of every number, we would see that 2 is the smallest prime factor for exactly half of them, all of the even numbers.\n And 3 is the smallest prime factor for a sixth of all numbers, anything that's divisible by 3 but not by 2. And so on. As we pick larger and larger primes, they form the smallest prime factor for fewer and fewer integers.\n And what if we track the second smallest prime factor of each number? Well first we have 3, which is the second prime factor of a number, only when the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, or divisible by 6. So 1 sixth of all numbers have a\n second prime factor of 3. And as we keep going, which number will end up at the balancing point? This is the median second prime factor of all numbers. All numbers from 1 all the way up to a googol and off to infinity.\n Would you believe that that number is 37? Let's take a look at 5. 5 is the second prime factor only when a number is divisible by 5 and 3, but not 2. Or 5 and 2, but not 3.\n In the first case, a number divisible by 5 and 3 means it's divisible by 15, so that's 115th of all numbers. But it also can't be divisible by 2, so half of 115th is a 30th of all numbers. In the second case, a number divisible by\n 5 and 2 means it's divisible by 10, but it cannot be divisible by 3, so we're left with 1 tenth times 2 thirds equals 1 fifteenth of all numbers. Adding up these two cases, we get that 1 tenth of all numbers have 5 as their\n second prime factor. And we can repeat this for the next prime 7. Just take each of these cases and add them up to get that 115th of all integers have a second prime factor of 7. And so on. Keeping a running\n In total, we quickly approach a balancing point for the second prime factor across all integers. And then we reach it. So the median second prime factor of all numbers is 37. Half of numbers have a second\n There are other remarkable qualities about 37 as a prime. It's an irregular prime, a Cuban prime, a lucky prime, a sexy prime, a permutable prime, a Padovan prime,\n prime, and at this point mathematicians might just be making up types of primes. 37's identity as a prime number is so strong that the same day I first learned the number 37, I learned it was prime. This was one of my first books as a toddler. It teaches\n you every number from 1 to 100 with a short story or fun fact for each. So for 26, that's how many letters in the alphabet, or for 30, they give the days of September, or for 52, that's how many cards are in a deck. Except 37.\n It's a prime number. Nothing goes into it. Someday, you'll understand. I did not like that. I understood every other number, so I also wanted to understand 37. So that number has nagged me ever since, and now this video is\n being made some 20 years later. Not convinced yet?\n between every digit, then that number is a multiple of 37. And I literally spent the next month on the bus trying to prove that fact, which I finally did. Just rattle off a six digit number. Tell me any six digit number.\n 4-1-3-6-2-5. It's not divisible by 37. So how did I figure that out? There's a trick for that. Is this your party trick that you can bring out? Surprisingly, it doesn't impress as many people as you would think.\n I think it should impress everybody.\n accept a job offer you received, or it can be as small as whether to stop the next gas station on a road trip. These are all problems where you can't assess all the options at once, and then decide. With each option you encounter, you need to decide whether to accept it,\n or reject it forever and see what comes next.\n already. So your best bet is somewhere in the middle. There you know at least some information from the options you've seen, and you have some choice to select or pass. But how do you know exactly when to decide?\n The optimal strategy looks like this. First you need to see some options and reject them automatically, just to learn what's out there. And then, at a certain stopping point S, you need to stop rejecting them and start evaluating whether an option is the\n best you've seen so far. If it is, then select it. But when should that stopping point be? We need to work out which stopping point maximizes our chances of picking the best option. We can calculate these chances.\n For each spot, find the probability that the best option is located there, times the probability we get there from stopping point S. Then add these probabilities up across every spot. Now the chance of\n the best option being in any spot is just random, if there are n options in total it's 1 over n. But it's a little harder to find the chances of getting to each spot. Say the best option is in the next spot after s, s plus\n What are the chances we get there? Well, since this is the next spot over from the stopping point, we have a 100% chance of getting there, so we're guaranteed to visit it and select it. But if the true best option is in spot S++,\n Well, there's a small chance we'll miss it. If the best of all the previous options is sitting in spot S plus one, we would just pick that and stop looking before reaching S plus two. There's a one in S plus one chance of this happening. So the chance is\n chances we do get to spot S plus 2 to pick the true best option is 1 minus that, or S over S plus 1. This same calculation continues up until the last spot N. We only get here if we've been passing on\n In total, this gives us the expression 1 over n times 1 plus s over s plus 1 plus\n S over S plus 2, and so on all the way up to S over N minus 1. Factoring out the S, the sum inside the parentheses approximates the function 1 over X, going from S to N. Taking that integral, we get the natural\n log of n over s. So the probability we select the best option is s over n times the natural log of n over s. To maximize this probability, we can find the peak of this function by setting its derivative to zero.\n And this gives the natural log of s over n equals negative 1. So s over n equals 1 over e, or about 37%. So explore and reject 37% of all\n options just to get a sense of what's out there. And then pick the first option to come along that's better than all of the ones you've seen so far. And your chances of success using this method are also 37%.\n This math question is known as the secretary problem or the marriage problem, as it also applies to hiring the best employees or even deciding on the best life partner. Now it can be impractical to check 37% of the options,\n because you don't always know how many candidates are out there. But the 37% rule also works for time. So if you want to get married, say, in 10 years, then spend the first 3.7 years seeing what's out there and then select the next person who's better than\n than anyone you've seen. So 37 is actually important to our lives, and people seem to subconsciously recognize this. We gravitate towards the number everywhere.\n 37 seconds 37 years 37 parties? I was 37.

Do you feel like everyone gets 37 this much?\n in their lives or do you feel like you're just attracting it? That's a good question. You know the reason I started was because it seemed like it turned up a lot. I started back in the 80s. There was a comedy routine by Charles Fleischer and he went through this sort of litany\n of coincidences about the number 37, like there are 37 holes in the speaker part of a telephone. Shakespeare wrote 37 plays, there's 37 movements in Beethoven's nine symphonies. There are all these amazing coincidences that he rattled off. I was amazed.\n I've been collecting them ever since. Since like 1981. Yeah, so 43 years probably. I built the 37 website for the first time in 1994. I don't know how the website got out.\n But somehow it got out there. I started getting email from strangers. I've got maybe a half a dozen people from around the world who every week or month will post their latest batch of 37s that they've seen out and about.\n And they've been doing this for how long? 18 years. Wow. We're tireless. The tireless cabal of 37 people. Yeah. Do you have anything to say to anyone who might be like, 37, that's just a base 10 representation of that number.\n I am also interested in the number 37 in all of its various other forms. Roman numerals, binary numbers, 100101 by the way, numbers in any other base, 25 in hexadecimal.\n So maybe there's even something innately,\n universally special about this number.\n We can argue special coincidences for many numbers, but we need to finally address the elephant in the room. The sheer amount of brain power 37 secretly takes up in our collective minds. It's humanity's go-to randomness.\n number, one of our most prominent prime numbers, and most of all, our ideal number for making decisions. Maybe that's why we're inclined to it naturally. It feels right to us as where to settle and what to pick, though with this video we may have ruined Randy\n I mean, the next time anyone asks people to pick a random number between 1 and 100, more people than ever might be saying 37.

            "transcription": "This single equation spawned four multi-trillion dollar industries and transformed everyone's approach to risk. Do you think that most people are aware of the size scale utility of derivatives? No, no idea.\n But at its core, this equation comes from physics, from discovering atoms, understanding how heat is transferred, and how to beat the casino at Blackjack. So maybe it shouldn't be surprising that some of the best to beat the stock market were not veterans.\n In 1988, a mathematics professor named Jim Simons set up the Medallion Investment Fund. And every year for the next 30 years, the Medallion Fund delivered higher returns than the market average.\n average, and not just by a little bit. It returned 66% per year. At that rate of growth, $100 invested in 1988 would be worth $8.4 billion today.\n This made Jim Simons easily the richest mathematician of all time. But being good at math doesn't guarantee success in financial markets. Just ask Isaac Newton. In 1720, Newton was 77 years old.\n and he was rich. He had made a lot of money working as a professor at Cambridge for decades and he had a side hustle as the master of the royal mint. His net worth was 30,000 pounds, the equivalent of six million dollars today.\n Now to grow his fortune, Newton invested in stocks. One of his big bets was on the South Sea Company. Their business was shipping enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Business was booming and the share price grew rapidly.\n By April of 1720, the value of Newton's shares had doubled, so he sold his stock. But the stock price kept going up. And by June, Newton bought back in. And he kept buying shares even as the price peaked.\n When the price started to fall, Newton didn't sell. He bought more shares, thinking he was buying the dip. But there was no rebound, and ultimately he lost around a third of his wealth. When asked why he didn't see it coming,\n Newton responded, I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people. So what did Simons get right that Newton got wrong? Well, for one thing, Simons was able to stand on the shore.\n shoulders of giants.\n business a few years later and moved to Paris to study physics. But he needed a job to support himself and his family, and he found one at the Bourse, the Paris stock exchange. Inside was Newton's madness of people in its rawest form. Hundreds of traders\n screaming prices, making hand signals, and doing deals. The thing that captured B\u00e9chalier's interest were contracts known as options. The earliest known options were bought around 600 BC by the Greek philosopher\n Thales of Miletus. He believed that the coming summer would yield a bumper crop of olives. To make money off this idea, he could have purchased olive presses, which, if he were right, would be in great demand. But he didn't have enough money to buy the machines.\n instead he went to all the existing olive press owners and paid them a little bit of money to secure the option to rent their presses in the summer for a specified price. When the harvest came, Thales was right. There were so many olives that the price of renting a press\n skyrocketed. Thales paid the press owners their pre-agreed price and then he rented out the machines at a higher rate and pocketed the difference. Thales had executed the first known call option. A call option gives you\n the right but not the obligation to buy something at a later date for a set price, known as the strike price. You can also buy a put option, which gives you the right but not the obligation to sell something at a later date for the strike price. Put options are useful if you expect the\n price to go down, call options are useful if you expect the price to go up. For example, let's say the current price of Apple stock is $100, but you expect it to go up. You could buy a call option for $10 that gives you the right, but not\n obligation to buy Apple stock in one year for $100. That is the strike price. Just a little side note, American options can be exercised on any date up to the expiry, whereas European options must be exercised on the expiry date.\n To keep things simple, we'll stick to European options. So if in a year the price of Apple stock has gone up to $130, you can use the option to buy shares for $100 and then immediately sell them for $130. After you take into account\n the $10 you paid for the option, you've made a $20 profit. Alternatively, if in a year the stock price has dropped to $70, you just wouldn't use the option and you've lost the $10 you paid for it. So the profit and loss diagram looks\n like this. If the stock price ends up below the strike price, you lose what you paid for the option. But if the stock price is higher than the strike price, then you earn that difference minus the cost of the option. There are at least three\n The second benefit is\n Options provide leverage. If you had bought the stock and it went up to $130, then your investment grew by 30%. But if you had bought the option, you only had to put up $10. So your profit of $20 is actually a 200% return on investment.\n On the downside, if you owned the stock, your investment would have only dropped by 30%, whereas with the option, you lose all 100%. So with options trading, there's a chance to make much larger profits, but also much bigger losses.\n The third benefit is you can use options as a hedge.\n So options can be an incredibly useful investing tool. But what Bachelier saw on the trading floor was chaos, especially when it came\n to the price of stock options. Even though they had been around for hundreds of years, no one had found a good way to price them. Traders would just bargain to come to an agreement about what the price should be.\n the future seems like a very amorphous kind of a trade. And so coming up with prices for these rather strange objects has been a challenge that's plagued a number of economists and business people for centuries.\n Now, Bachelier, already interested in probability, thought there had to be a mathematical solution to this problem, and he proposed this as his PhD topic to his advisor Henri Poincar\u00e9. Looking into the math of finance wasn't really something people did back\n then. But to Bachelier's surprise, Poincar\u00e9 agreed. To accurately price an option, first you need to know what happens to stock prices over time. The price of a stock is basically set by a tug of war between buyers and sellers.\n When more people want to buy a stock, the price goes up. When more people want to sell a stock, the price goes down. But the number of buyers and sellers can be influenced by almost anything, like the weather, politics, new competitors, innovation, and so on.\n So, Bachelier realized that it's virtually impossible to predict all these factors accurately. So the best you can do is assume that at any point in time, the stock price is just as likely to go up as down. And therefore, over the long term, stock prices\n Prices follow a random walk, moving up and down as if their next move is determined by the flip of a coin.\n The idea that you shouldn't be able to buy an asset and sell it immediately for a profit is known as the efficient market hypothesis.\n trading on those predictions, the less predictable those prices are. If you and I could predict the stock market tomorrow, then we would do it. We would start trading today on stocks that we thought were going to go up tomorrow. Well, if we did that, then\n But instead of going up tomorrow, they would go up now as we bought more and more of the stock. So the very act of predicting actually affects the quality of the future outcomes. And so in a totally efficient market,\n This is a Galton board. It's got rows of pegs arranged in a triangle and around 6,000\n thousand tiny ball bearings that I can pour through the pegs. Each time a ball hits a peg, there's a 50-50 chance it goes to the left or the right. So each ball follows a random walk as it passes through these pegs, which makes it basically impossible to predict the\n path of any individual ball, but if I flip this over, what you can see is that all the balls together always create a predictable pattern. That is, a collection of random walks creates a normal distribution. It's\n centered around the middle because the number of paths a ball could take to get here is the greatest and The further out you go the fewer the pass of all could take to get there Like if you want to end up here Well, the ball would have to go left left left left all the way down. So there's only one way to get here\n here, but to get into the middle, there are thousands of paths that a ball could take. Now, Bachelier believed a stock price is just like a ball going through a Galton board. Each additional layer of pegs represents a time step.\n So after a short time, the stock price could only move up or down a little, but after more time, a wider range of prices is possible. According to B\u00e9chalier, the expected future price of a stock is described by a normal distribution, centered on the current price\n which spreads out over time. B\u00e9chalier realized he had rediscovered the exact equation which describes how heat radiates from regions of high temperature to regions of low temperature. This was first discovered by Joseph\n of Fourier back in 1822. So, B\u00e9chalier called his discovery the radiation of probabilities. Since he was writing about finance, the physics community didn't take any notice. But the mathematics of the random walk would go on to solve\n an almost century-old mystery in physics. In 1827, Scottish botanist Robert Brown was looking at pollen grains under the microscope, and he noticed that the particles suspended in water on the microscope slide were moving around\n randomly. Because he didn't know whether it was something to do with the pollen being living material, he tested non-organic particles such as dust from lava and meteorite rock. Again, he saw them moving around in the same way. So\n Brown discovered that any particles, if they were small enough, exhibited this random movement which came to be known as Brownian motion. But what caused it remained a mystery. 80 years later, in 1905,\n Einstein figured out the answer. Over the previous couple hundred years the idea that gases and liquids were made up of molecules became more and more popular, but not everyone was convinced that molecules were real in a physical\n sense, just that the theory explained a lot of observations. The idea led Einstein to hypothesize that Brownian motion is caused by the trillions of molecules hitting the particle from every direction every instant. Occasionally, more will hit from one\n side than the other and the particle will momentarily jump. To derive the mathematics, Einstein supposed that, as an observer, we can't see or predict these collisions with any certainty, so at any time we have to assume that the particle is just as likely to move in one direction\n direction as another. So just like stock prices, microscopic particles move like a ball falling down a Galton board. The expected location of a particle is described by a normal distribution which broadens with time. It's why even in\n completely still water microscopic particles spread out. This is diffusion. By solving the Brownian motion mystery, Einstein had found definitive evidence that atoms and molecules exist. Of course, he had no idea that\n Bachelier had uncovered the random walk five years earlier. By the time Bachelier finished his PhD, he had finally figured out a mathematical way to price an option. Remember that with a call option, if the future price of a stock is less than the\n strike price, then you lose the premium paid for the option. But if the stock price is greater than the strike price, you pocket that difference, and you make a net profit if the stock has gone up by more than you paid for the option. So the probability that an option buyer makes a profit?\n is the probability that the price increases by more than the price paid for it, which is the green shaded area. And the probability that the seller makes money is just the probability that the price stays low enough that the buyer doesn't earn more than they paid for it. This is the red shaded area.\n Multiplying the profit or loss by the probability of each outcome, Vichellier calculated the expected return of an option. Now, how much should it cost? If the price of an option is too high, no one will want to buy it. Conversely,\n if the price is too low, everyone will want to buy it. B\u00e9chellier argued that the fair price is what makes the expected return for buyers and sellers equal. Both parties should stand to gain or lose the same amount. That was B\u00e9chellier's insight into\n how to accurately price an option. When Bachelier finished his thesis, he had beaten Einstein to inventing the random walk and solved the problem that had eluded options traders for hundreds of years. But no one noticed. The physicists were uninterested.\n and traders weren't ready. The key thing missing was a way to make a ton of money. Hey, so I'm not sure how stock traders sleep at night with billions of dollars riding on the madness of people, but I have been sleeping just fine thanks to the sponsors\n of this video, 8 Sleep. I've recently moved to Australia and it has been really hot, but I've been keeping cool at night using the 8 Sleep pod. It's a smart mattress cover that can control the temperature of the bed and track how well you sleep. You can set the temperature to whatever you\n like from around 13 degrees Celsius all the way up to 43 degrees Celsius and my wife likes it a little warmer than I do so it's useful that we can each have our own temperature on our own side of the bed. If you don't know what works best for you, well the pod will learn your ideas\n deal temperature and optimize it throughout the night using its autopilot. Usually that means getting a couple of degrees cooler during the start of the night and then warming up in the morning to help you wake up. You can also have it wake you with a slight vibration, which is really pleasant and it doesn't disturb\n your partner like an annoying phone sound.\n sponsoring this part of the video.\n to make a fortune. He headed to Vegas and sat down at the blackjack table. Back then the dealer only used a single deck of cards so Thorpe could keep a mental note of all the cards that had been played as he saw them. This allowed him to work out if he had an advantage.\n He would bet a bigger portion of his funds when the odds were in his favor and less when they weren't. He had invented card counting. This is a remarkable innovation considering Blackjack had been around in various forms for hundreds of years.\n And for a while, this made him a lot of money. But the casinos got wise to his strategy, and they added more decks of cards to the game to reduce the benefit of card counting. So Thorpe took his winnings to what he called the biggest casino on Earth.\n He started a hedge fund that would go on to make a 20% return every year for 20 years, the best performance ever seen at that time. And he did it by transferring the skills he honed at the Blackjack table to the stock market.\n stock market. Thorpe pioneered a type of hedging, a way to protect against losses with balancing or compensating transactions.\n Suppose Bob sells Alice a call option on a stock. And let's say the stock has gone up, so now it's in the money for Alice.\n Every additional $1 the stock price goes up, Bob will lose $1. But he can eliminate this risk by owning one unit of stock. Then if the price goes up, he would lose $1 from the option but gain that dollar back from the stock.\n And if the stock drops back out of the money for Alice, he sells the stock so he doesn't risk losing any money from that either. This is called dynamic hedging. It means Bob can make a profit with minimal risk from fluctuating stock prices.\n portfolio pie at any one time will offset the option V with some amount of stock delta.\n As we saw with Bob's example, delta, the amount of\n But Thorpe wasn't satisfied with B\u00e9chellier's model for pricing options. I mean, for one thing, stock prices\n arent entirely random. They can increase over time if the business is doing well, or fall if it isn't. Bechelier's model ignored this, so Thorpe came up with a more accurate model for pricing options, which took this drift into account.\n figured out what this model was back in the middle of 1967 and I decided that I would just use it for myself and then later I kept it quiet for my own\n His strategy was, if the option was going cheap according to his model, buy it. If it was overvalued, short sell it, that is bet against it. And that way, more often than not, he would end up on the winning\n side of the trade. This lasted until 1973. In that year, Fisher Black and Myron Scholes came up with an equation that changed the industry. Robert Merton independently published his own version which was based on the mathematics.\n of stochastic calculus, so he is also credited.\n Like Bachelier, they thought that option prices should offer a fair bet to both buyers and sellers, but their approach was totally new. They said if it was possible to construct a risk-free portfolio\n of options and stocks just like Thorpe was doing with his delta hedging, then in an efficient market, a fair market, this portfolio should return nothing more than the risk-free rate, what the same money would earn if invested in the safest asset, US Treasury bonds.\n The assumption was that if you're not taking on any additional risk, then it shouldn't be possible to receive any extra returns. To describe how stock prices change over time, Black, Scholes, and Merton used an improved version of Bachelier's model, just like Thor.\n This says that at any time we expect the stock price to move randomly plus a general trend up or down, the drift. By combining these two equations, Black, Scholz, and Merton came up with the most famous equation in finance.\n It relates the price of any kind of contract to any asset, stocks, bonds, you name it. The same year they published this equation, the Chicago Board Options Exchange was founded. Why is that equation so important?\n like for finance, how did that change\n This led to one of the fastest adoptions by industry of an academic idea in all of the social sciences.\n After just a couple of years, the Black Shell's formula was adopted as the benchmark for Wall Street for trading options. The exchange traded options market has exploded and it's now a multi-trillion dollar industry.\n volume in this market has been doubling roughly every five years. So this is the financial equivalent of Moore's Law. There are other businesses that have grown just as quickly like Credit Default Swaps Market, the OTC Derivative\n This opened up a whole new way to hedge against\n anything, and not just for hedge funds. Nowadays, pretty much every large company, governments, and even individual investors use options to hedge against their own specific risks. Suppose you're running an airline, and you're worried that an increase in oil\n prices would eat into your profits. While using the Black-Scholes-Merton equation, there's a way to accurately and efficiently hedge that risk. You price an option to buy something that tracks the price of oil, and that option will pay off if oil prices go up.\n And that will help compensate you for the higher cost of fuel you have to pay. So Black Scholes-Merton can help reduce risk, but it can also provide leverage. An ongoing battle between bullish day traders and hedge fund short sellers that have\n that\n Reddit sub channel Wall Street bets decided that the hedge fund managers that were shorting the stock and betting that the company would go out of business needed to be punished. And so they bought shares of GameStop stock to try to drive\n up price. Turns out that buying the stock was not enough because with a dollar's worth of cash you can buy a dollar's worth of stock. But with a dollar's worth of cash you can buy options that affected many more than a dollar's worth of stock.\n perhaps in some cases $10 or $20 worth of stock for a dollar's worth of options. And so there's natural leverage embedded in these securities. And so the combination of buying both the stock and the options\n the prices to rise very quickly. And what that did was to cause these hedge fund managers to lose a lot of money quickly. How big is this market for derivatives? How big is this whole area that kind of comes out of Black Scholes-Merton?\n There are estimates of how large derivatives markets are. And first, let's be clear what a derivative is. A derivative is a financial security whose value derives from another financial security. So an option is an example of\n How does that compare to the size of the underlying securities they're based on?\n of the underlying securities. I just have to interrupt because it seems kind of crazy that you have more money riding on the things that are based on the thing than the thing itself. That's right. So tell me how that makes any sense.\n Because what options allow you to do is to take the underlying thing and turn it into five, ten, twenty, fifty things. So these pieces of paper that we call options and derivatives, they basically allow us to create\n Does this make the markets and the global economy\n economy, more stable or less stable or no effect? All three. So it turns out that during normal times, these markets are a very significant source of liquidity\n and therefore stability. During abnormal times, by that I mean when there are periods of market stress, all of these securities can go in one direction, typically down, and when they go down together,\n In 1997, Merton and Schoenberg\n were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics. Black was acknowledged for his contributions, but unfortunately he had passed away just two years earlier. With the option\n Before Simons had any exposure to the stock market, he was a mathematician. His work on Riemann\n Geometry was instrumental in many areas of mathematics and physics, including knot theory, quantum field theory, and quantum computing. Churn-Simon's theory laid the mathematical foundation for string theory. In 1976, the American Mathematical Society presented\n When he founded Renaissance Technologies in 1978, his strategy was to use machine learning to find patterns\n in the stock market. Patterns provide opportunities to make money. The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data and we had to get it by hand in the early days. We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories.\n His rationale was that the market is far too complex for anyone to be able to make predictions with certainty. But Simons had worked for the US Institute for Defense Analysis during the Cold War, breaking Russian codes by\n extracting patterns from masses of data. Simons was convinced that a similar approach could beat the market. He then used his academic contacts to hire a bunch of the best scientists he could find.\n What were you looking for in life? I had a PhD in physics and had five years out and had written a few good papers and was obviously a smart guy or in astronomy or in mathematics or in statistics.\n who had done science and done it well. It's not surprising that mathematicians and physicists are involved in this field. First of all, finance pays a lot better than, you know, being an assistant professor of mathematics. And for a number of mathematicians,\n One of these was Leonard Baum, a pioneer of hidden Markov models. Just as Einstein realized that although we can't directly observe\n atoms we can infer their existence through their effect on pollen grains, hidden Markov models aim to find factors that are not directly observable but do have an effect on what we can observe. And soon after that, Renaissance launched their now famous medallion fund.\n Using hidden Markov models and other data-driven strategies, the Medallion Fund became the highest returning investment fund of all time. This led Bradford Cornell of UCLA and his paper Medallion Fund, the ultimate counter example, to conclude\n that maybe the efficient market hypothesis itself is wrong.\n So it's possible to beat the market, is what you're saying.\n The people who have found the patterns in the stock market, and the randomness for that matter, have often been physicists and mathematicians.\n But their impact has gone beyond just making them rich. By modeling market dynamics, they've provided new insight into risk and opened up whole new markets. They've determined what the accurate price of derivatives should be.\n And in doing so, they have helped eliminate market inefficiencies. Ironically, if we are ever able to discover all the patterns in the stock market, knowing what they are will allow us to eliminate them. And then we will finally have a perfect\n efficient market where all price movements are truly random.\n you"

            "transcription": "Picture this, you wake up one morning and you feel a little bit sick. No particular symptoms, just not 100%. And so you go to the doctor and she also doesn't know what's going on with you so she suggests they run a battery of tests. And after a week goes by\n by\n And she says, well, the test will correctly identify 99% of people that have the disease and only incorrectly identify 1% of people who don't have the disease. So that sounds pretty bad. I mean, what are the chances that you actually\n have this disease. I think most people would say 99% because that's the accuracy of the test. But that is not actually correct. You need Bayes' theorem to get some perspective.\n Bayes' theorem can give you the probability that some hypothesis, say that you actually have the disease, is true\n given an event that you tested positive for the disease. To calculate this, you need to take the prior probability the hypothesis was true, that is, how likely you thought it was that you had this disease before you got the test results, and multiply it by the probability of the event given the hypothesis.\n This term is a combination of your probability of having the disease and correctly testing positive, plus\n your probability of not having the disease and being falsely identified. The prior probability that a hypothesis is true is often the hardest part of this equation to figure out, and sometimes it's no better than a guess, but in this case a reasonable starting point is the frequency\n of the disease in the population, so 0.1%. And if you plug in the rest of the numbers, you find that you have a 9% chance of actually having the disease after testing positive. Which is incredibly low if you think about it. Now this isn't some\n of crazy magic. It's actually common sense applied to mathematics. Just think about a sample size of a thousand people. Now one person out of that thousand is likely to actually have the disease and the test would likely identify them correctly as having\n the disease. But out of the 999 other people, 1% or 10 people would falsely be identified as having the disease. So if you're one of those people who has a positive test result and everyone's just selected at random, well you're actually part\n of a group of 11 where only one person has the disease so your chances of actually having it are 1 in 11. 9%. It just makes sense. When Bayes first came up with this theorem he didn't actually think it was revolutionary.\n He didn't even think it was worthy of publication. He didn't submit it to the Royal Society, of which he was a member, and in fact it was discovered in his papers after he died and he had abandoned it for more than a decade. His relatives asked his friend\n Richard Price to dig through his papers and see if there was anything worth publishing in there. And that's where Price discovered what we now know as the origins of Bayes' theorem. Bayes originally considered a thought experiment, where he was sitting with his back to a perfectly flat, perfectly\n square table and then he would ask an assistant to throw a ball onto the table. Now this ball could obviously land and end up anywhere on the table and he wanted to figure out where it was. So what he'd ask his assistant to do was throw on another ball and then\n tell him if it landed to the left or to the right or in front behind of the first ball. And he would note that down and then ask for more and more balls to be thrown on the table. What he realized was that through this method he could keep\n keep updating his idea of where the first ball was. Now of course he would never be completely certain, but with each new piece of evidence, he would get more and more accurate. And that's how Bayes saw the world. It wasn't that he thought the world\n was not determined that reality didn't quite exist but it was that we couldn't know it perfectly and all we could hope to do was update our understanding as more and more evidence became available. When Richard Price\n introduced Bayes' theorem. He made an analogy to a man coming out of a cave. Maybe he'd lived his whole life in there and he saw the sunrise for the first time and kind of thought to himself, is this a one-off? Is this a quirk? Or does the sun\n always do this. And then every day after that, as the sun rose again, he could get a little bit more confident that, well, that was the way the world works. So Bayes' theorem wasn't really a formula intended to be used just once.\n was intended to be used multiple times, each time gaining new evidence and updating your probability that something is true. So if we go back to the first example when you tested positive for a disease, what would happen if you went to another doctor, get a second\n opinion and get that test run again, but let's say by a different lab just to be sure that those tests are independent. And let's say that test also comes back as positive. Now what is the probability that you actually have the disease? Well you can use Bayes formula again.\n except this time for your prior probability that you have the disease you have to put in the posterior probability the probability that we worked out before which is 9% because you've already had one positive test and if you crunch those numbers the new probability\n based on two positive tests is 91%. There's a 91% chance that you actually have the disease, which kind of makes sense. Two positive results by different labs are unlikely to just be chance, but you'll notice that probability is still\n not as high as the accuracy, the reported accuracy of the test. Bayes' theorem has found a number of practical applications, including notably filtering your spam. You know, traditional spam filters actually do a kind of bad job. There's too many\n false positives, too much of your email ends up in spam. But using a Bayesian filter, you can look at the various words that appear in emails and use Bayes' theorem to give a probability that the email is spam, given that those words appear.\n Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our beliefs in light of new evidence, but it can't tell us how to set our prior beliefs. So it's possible for some people to hold that certain things are true with 100% certainty, and other people to hold those same things\n are true with 0% certainty. What Bayes' theorem shows us is that in those cases, there is absolutely no evidence, nothing anyone could do, to change their minds. And so as Nate Silver points out in his book, The Signal and the Noise,\n We should probably not have debates between people with 100% prior certainty and 0% prior certainty because, well, really, they'll never convince each other of anything. Most of the time when people talk about Bayes' theorem, they discuss how calculus\n intuitive it is and how we don't really have an inbuilt sense of it. But recently my concern has been the opposite, that maybe we're too good at internalizing the thinking behind Bayes' theorem. And the reason I'm worried about that is because\n I think in life we can get used to particular circumstances, we can get used to results, maybe getting rejected or failing at something or getting paid a low wage, and we can internalize that as though we are that man emerging from\n the cave and we see the sunrise every day and every day and we keep updating our beliefs to a point of near certainty that we think that that is basically the way that nature is it's the way the world is and there's nothing that we can do to\n change it. You know, there's Nelson Mandela's quote that everything is impossible until it's done and I think that is kind of a very Bayesian viewpoint on the world. If you have no instances of something happening then\n What is your prior for that event? It will seem completely impossible your prior may be zero until it actually happens You know the thing we forget in Bayes theorem is that our actions play a role in determining outcomes and determining how true\n things actually are. But if we internalize that something is true and maybe we're 100% sure that it's true and there's nothing we can do to change it, well then we're gonna keep on doing the same thing and we're gonna keep on getting the same results.\n It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I think a really good understanding of Bayes' theorem implies that experimentation is essential. If you've been doing the same thing for a long time and getting the same result that you're not necessarily happy with,\n maybe it's time to change. So is there something like that that you've been thinking about?

            "transcription": "Take the number 5 and square it. You get 25. Now take 25 and square it. You get 625. Square 625 and you get 390,625. Do you see the pattern?\n 5 squared ends in a 5, 25 squared ends in 25, and 625 squared ends in 625. So does this pattern continue? Let's try squaring 390,625. It doesn't\n quite end in itself, but the last five digits match, so it extends the pattern by a few places. So let's try squaring just that part, 90,625. That does end in itself, and if we square that whole number,\n It also ends in itself, and now we're up to 10 digits. And you can keep doing this, squaring the part of the answer that matches the previous number and increasing the number of digits they share in common. It's as though we are converging on a number.\n But not in the usual sense of convergence. This number will have infinite digits and if you square it, you'll get back that same number. The number is its own square. Now, I bet you're thinking,\n Does it even make sense to talk about numbers that have infinite digits going off to the left of the decimal point? I mean, isn't that just infinity? In this video, my goal is to convince you that such numbers do make sense. They just belong to a number system that works very differently.\n differently from the one we're used to. And that allows these numbers to solve problems that are impenetrable using ordinary numbers, which is why they are a fundamental tool in cutting edge research today in number theory, algebraic geometry and beyond.\n So let's start by looking at the properties of the number system that includes the number we just found. We'll call these 10-addict numbers because they're written in base 10. If you have two 10-addict numbers, can you add them together?\n Sure, you just go digit by digit from the right to the left, adding them up as usual. Addition is not a problem. What about multiplication? Well, again, you can take any two tenatic numbers and multiply them out. This works\n because the last digit of the answer depends only on the last digits of the ten-adic numbers, and subsequent digits depend only on the numbers to their right. So it might take a lot of work, but you can keep going for as many digits as you like.\n Let's take one tenatic number ending in 8 5 7 1 4 2 8 5 7 1 4 3 and multiply it by 7. So 7 times 3 is 21, carry the 2.\n 7 x 4 is 28, plus 2 makes 30, carry the 3. 7 x 1 is 7, plus 3 makes 10, carry the 1. 7 x 7 is 49, plus 1 is 50, carry the 5. 7 x 5 is 35, plus 5 is 40, carry the 4.\n And you can keep going forever and you'll find all the other digits are zero. So this number times 7 equals 1, which means this tenatic number must be equal to 1 seventh.\n What we have just found is that there are rational numbers, fractions, in the tenatic numbers without having to use the divided by symbol. Say you want to find the tenatic number that equals a third.\n would you do it? Well, let's imagine we have an infinite string of digits and when we multiply them by 3 we get 1. This implies that all the digits to the left of the 1 must be 0. So what do we multiply 3 by to get a 1 in the unit\n place. 3 times 7 is 21, so that gives us the 1, and then we carry the 2. Now what times 3 plus 2 gives us a 0? 6. 3 times 6 equals 18, plus 2 equals\n 20 so we have a 0 and we carry the 2. Put another 6 there and we get another 20 again so if we put a string of 6's all the way to the left they will all multiply to make 0. So an infinite string of 6's and one 7 is equal\n This looks similar to the infinite digits we're used to going off to the right of the decimal point, like 0.999999 repeating. What does this equal? Well, I'll claim that it's equal to\n exactly equal to 1. But how do we prove it? Let's call this number k and then multiply both sides by 10. So now we've got 9.999 repeating equals 10k. Now, subtract the top equation from the\n bottom one to get 9 equals 9k. So k equals 1. This is a fairly standard argument for why .999 repeating must be exactly equal to 1. But what if, instead of going to the right of the\n decimal place, the 9s went to the left of the decimal place. That is, a tenatic number of all 9s. What does this number equal? Well, we can do the same thing. Set it equal to, say, m, and then multiply both sides by\n 10. So we have 9999999990 equals 10m. Now subtract this equation from the first one and we get 9 equals negative 9m, meaning m equals negative\n 1. So this ten-addict string of all nines is actually negative 1. Now I know that seems weird, so let's try adding 1 to it. Well, 9 plus 1 is 10, carry the 1. 9 plus 1 is 10, carry\n the 1, and you just keep doing this all the way down the line and every digit becomes 0. I know it seems like at some point you're going to end up with a 1 all the way down on the left, but this never happens because the 9s go on forever. All 9s\n Therefore, all 9s must be equal to negative 1. This also means that all 9s and then say a 3 equals negative 7. What we have just discovered is that the 10-addicts contain negative numbers as well.\n well. You don't need a negative sign. By the structure of these numbers alone, negatives are included. To do subtraction, you just add the negative of that number. To find the negative of any tenatic number, you could multiply by all nines.\n Or just perform these two steps. First, take the 9's complement, that is the difference between each digit and 9, and then add 1. So if this number is 1 seventh, then negative a seventh is 142.\n And we can verify that this is indeed negative a seventh by adding it to positive one seventh and finding that these numbers annihilate each other's\n to zero. So to sum up, tenatic numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and they work exactly as you'd expect. Plus they contain fractions and negative numbers without having to use additional symbols. There is just\n one big problem and you can see it with the first tenatic number we found. Remember if you multiply this number by itself you get back that same number. This number is its own square and that's a problem which you can see\n if we move the n to the left hand side and factor it. Well then we have n times n minus 1 equals 0. The numbers 0 or 1 would satisfy this equation, but our tenatic number is not 0 or 1. You can even verify\n by multiplying it out, this number n times n-1 really does work out to zero. This breaks one of the tools mathematicians rely on to solve equations. Have you ever thought about why when faced with some complicated equation\n we move all the terms to one side, set them equal to zero, and then factor them? Well, I certainly haven't before making this video, but there is a good reason, and it comes down to the special property of zero. If several terms multiplied together,\n equal 0, then you know at least one of those terms must be 0. And this allows us to break down complicated higher order equations into a set of smaller, simpler equations and solve. But this won't\n So we work with the ten-addicts, and fundamentally the reason is because we're working in base 10, and 10 is a composite number, it's not a prime, it's 5 times 2. Say you want to find two ten-addict numbers that multiply to zero.\n Then, to start off, you know that the last digit must be 0. So which two numbers could you multiply to get a 0 in the unit's place? Well, you could multiply 0 times any number, that's no problem, but you could also multiply, say, 5 times 4.\n and get 20, which gives you a zero in the units place. Then you can carry the two and find another two numbers that will give you a zero in the tens place, and you can keep building the numbers from there so that all the digits work out to zero. There is a way to avoid this\n this and that is to use a prime number base instead of base 10. It could be any prime like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. As an example let's create a 3-adic number. So this is a base 3 number with infinite digits to the left of the decimal point.\n In the three addicts, the only digits we can use are 0, 1, and 2, because 3 is the same thing as 1, 0. Now, how could you multiply two three-addict numbers to get 0? Well, again, we can start by just looking at the last digit.\n 1 times 1 is 1, 2 times 1 is 2, and 2 times 2 is 4, which in base 3 is 1, 1. So the only way to get a zero is if one of those three attic digits itself is zero.\n And it's the same for all the digits going to the left. The only way they multiply to zero is if one of the three attic numbers is itself entirely zero. And this works for any prime base and restores the useful property that the\n product of several numbers will only be zero if one of those numbers is itself zero. Here is a random 3-adic number. This number means 1 times 3 to the zero plus 2 times 3\n plus 1 times 3 squared plus 1 times 3 cubed and so on. So you can think of a 3-adic number as an infinite expansion in powers of 3. The 3-adic integer that equals negative 1 would be an infinite string of 2's.\n If you add 1, then 2 plus 1 is 3, which in base 3 is 1, 0. So you leave the 0, carry the 1, and 2 plus 1 is again 1, 0, so you carry the 1, and you keep going on like that forever.\n as the ten-addicts, but in addition you will never find a number that is its own square besides 0 and 1, nor will you find one non-zero number times another non-zero number being equal to 0. And this is why professional mathematicians work with p-addicts, where the p\n stands for prime, rather than the ten-addicts. P-addicts are the real tool. They have been used in the work of over a dozen recent fields medalists. They were even involved in cracking one of the most legendary math problems of all time.\n In 1637, Pierre de Fermat was reading the book Arithmetica by the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus. Diophantus was interested in the solutions to polynomial equations phrased in geometric terms, like the Pythagorean Theorem for\n For a right triangle, x squared plus y squared equals z squared. The set of solutions to this equation in the real numbers is pretty easy to find, it's just an infinite cone. But Diophantus wanted to find solutions that were whole numbers,\n fractions like 345 and 51213. And he wasn't the first. Here is an ancient Babylonian clay tablet from about 2000 BC with a huge list of these Pythagorean triples.\n By the way, this list predates Pythagoras by more than a millennium. Right next to Diophantis' discussion of the Pythagorean Theorem, Fermat writes a statement that will go down in history as one of the most infamous of all time. The equation x to the n\n n plus y to the n equals z to the n has no solutions in integers for any n greater than 2. I have a truly marvelous proof of this fact, but it's too long to be contained in the margin. Fermat's last theorem, as this became\n known would go unproven for 358 years. In fact, to solve it, new numbers had to be invented, the P-addicts. And these provide a systematic method for solving other problems in Diophantus' Arithmetica.\n For example, find three squares whose areas add to create a bigger square, and the area of the first square is the side length of the second square, and the area of the second square is the side length of the third square.\n giving the first instance of algebra many many centuries before algebra. So if we set the side of the first square to be x then its area is x squared. This is the side length of the second square which therefore has an area of x to the\n This is then the side length of the third square, which has an area of x to the 8. And we want these three areas, x squared plus x to the 4 plus x to the 8, to add to make a new square. So let's call its area y squared.\n So x squared plus x to the 4 plus x to the 8 equals y squared. Now it's not hard to find solutions to this equation in the real numbers. For example, set x equal to 1 and you find y is root 3. In fact, we can make a plot of all\n the real number solutions to this equation. But Diophantus wasn't interested in real solutions, he wanted rational solutions, solutions that are whole numbers or fractions. These are much harder to find. Where would you even start?\n Well, in the late 1800s, a mathematician named Kurt Hensel tried to find solutions\n So working with the prime 3, the solutions would take the form of x equals x naught plus x1 times 3 plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x1 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus x2 times 3 squared plus\n x3 times 3 cubed and so on, and y would also be a similar expansion in powers of 3. Each of the coefficients would be either 0, 1, or 2. Now imagine inserting these expressions into our equation\n for x and y and you can see it's going to get messy real fast. But there is a way to simplify things. Say you wanted to write 17 in base 3. Well one way to do it is to divide\n Divide 17 by 3 and find the remainder, which in this case is 2. So we know the units digit of our base 3 number is 2. Next, divide 17 by 9, the next higher power of 3, and you get a remainder of 8.\n Subtract off the 2 we found before and you have 6, which is 2 times 3. So we know the second to last digit is 2. Next, divide 17 by 27 and you get a remainder of 17. Subtract off the 8 we've already accounted for\n and you have 9, so the 9's digit is 1. So 17 in base 3 is 122. What we're doing here is a form of modular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, numbers reset back to 0 once\n reach a certain value called the modulus. The hours on a clock work kind of like this with a modulus of 12. The hours increase up to 11, but then 12 o'clock is the same thing as zero o'clock. If it's 10 in the morning, say,\n you could say 14, but usually we'd say 2pm, because 2 is 14 modulo 12. It's 2 more than a multiple of 12. So in other words,\n Modular arithmetic is only about finding the remainder. 36 modulo 10 or 36 mod 10 is 6 and 25 mod 5 is 0. Mod 3 means your clock only has 3 numbers in it.\n it 0, 1, and 2, and if you multiply 2 by 2 you get 4, and 4 is the same thing as 4 o'clock is the same thing as 1 o'clock on a 3 hour clock. What's great about this approach is it allows us to work\n out the coefficients in our expansion one at a time by first solving the equation mod 3 and then mod 9 and then mod 27 and so on. So first let's try to solve the equation mod 3 and since all the higher terms are divisible by the\n 3 they're all 0 if we're working mod 3 so we're left with x0 squared plus x0 to the fourth plus x0 to the eight equals y0 squared and this will allow us to find the values of x0 and y0 that satisfy the equation\n Now we know that x0 can be either 0, 1, or 2, and y0 can also be either 0, 1, or 2. If x is 0, then so is x2, x4, and x8. If x is 1, then x2 is 0, and x2 is 1.\n is 1, and so is x to the 4 and x to the 8. If x is 2, then x squared is 4, but remember we're working mod 3, and 4 mod 3 is just 1. To find x to the 4, we can just square x squared, so\n that also equals 1, and squaring again x to the 8 equals 1. Now we can sum up x squared plus x to the 4 plus x to the 8 to find the left hand side of the equation. If x is 0, then the sum is equal to 0.\n If x is 1 or 2, the sum is 3. But again, we're working mod 3, so 3 is the same as 0. Now, let's calculate y squared. If y is 0, y squared is 0. If y is 1, y squared is 1.\n And if y is 2, then y squared is 4, but again 4 mod 3 is 1. Now since for all values of x the left hand side of the equation is 0, the only value of y that satisfies the equation is y equals 0.\n But x can be 0, 1, or 2. So we have three potential solutions that satisfy our equation mod 3. We've got 0, 0, 1, 0, and 2, 0. Now we shouldn't be surprised to find 0, 0 as a solution.\n since x equals 0 and y equals 0 does satisfy the equation. But squares of zero size don't really count as solutions to Diophantus' geometric problem. So let's try to expand on one of the other solutions. I'll pick\n 1, 0. This means x0 equals 1 and y0 equals 0 satisfies the equation mod 3. Now let's try to find x1 and we'll do this by solving the equation mod 9. All of the terms higher than x1 have\n factor of 9 in them, so they're all 0 mod 9. So we're left with this expression. Expanding out the first term, we have 1 plus 6x1 plus 9x1 squared. But again, since we're working mod 9, the last part is 0.\n The next term is just the first term squared, so that equals 1 plus 12x1 plus 36x1 squared. But 36 is 9 times 4, so that's 0 mod 9. And 12 mod 9 is 3.\n So we have 1 plus 3x1. The final term is just that squared. So 1 plus 6x1 plus 9x1 squared. Again, the last part is 0. So on the left hand side we have 3 plus 15x1. And on the right hand side we have\n we have 0 plus 9y1 squared, which is also 0 because it contains a factor of 9. So 3 plus 15x1 equals 0. Now remember, since we're working mod 9, the 0 on the right hand side represents any\n multiple of 9. So in this case, if x1 equals 1, then 3 plus 15 equals 18, which is a multiple of 9, so it's 0. So x1 equals 1 is a solution to the equation. Let's find one more term\n the expansion by solving the equation mod 27. Again, all the terms with 3 raised to the power of 3 or higher contain a factor of 27, so they're zero, leaving only this expression. But we know x0 and\n x1 are equal to 1. So we can simplify to this. Expanding again, we get\n 16 plus 18x2 plus 81x squared, but 81 is 27 times 3, so that's 0. The next term is the square of the first, so 256 plus 576x2 plus 324x2\n squared. But 324 is 27 times 12, so that's zero, and since we're working mod 27, we can simplify this down. 576 is 9 more than a multiple of 27, and 256 is 13 more than a multiple of 25.\n So we're left with 13 plus 9x2. And the last term is just that squared, so 169 plus 234x2 plus 81x2 squared, which reduces to 7 plus 18x2.\n The right hand side reduces to 0 plus 81y squared, which is again 0. So we have 36 plus 45x2 equals 0, which mod 27 is the same as 9 plus 18x2 equals\n So x2 must be equal to 1. 9 plus 18 is 27, which mod 27 is 0. So what we've discovered is the first three coefficients in our expansion are all 1.\n And in fact, if you kept going with modulus 81, 243, and so on, you would find that all of the coefficients are 1. So the number that solves Diophantis' equation about the squares is actually a 3-adic number where\n all the digits are 1s. But how do we make sense of this? What does this number equal? Well remember that this is just another way of writing 1 times 3 to the 0 plus\n times 3 plus 1 times 3 squared plus 1 times 3 cubed and so on. So each term is just 3 times the term before it. This is a geometric series, and to find the sum of an infinite geometric series you can use\n the equation 1 over 1 minus lambda, where lambda is the ratio of one term to the previous one. So in this case, it's 3. Now, I know for this to work, lambda is meant to be strictly less than 1, because otherwise the terms keep growing and the sum\n doesn't converge, it just diverges to infinity. I promise I'll come back to this, but for now, let's just say that lambda equals 3 and see what happens. Well then we have 1 over 1 minus 3, which is negative 1 by 2.\n So if we believe this formula, then x equals negative a half should be a solution to our original equation. If we sub it in, we get x squared is a quarter, x to the 4 is a sixteenth, and x to the 8 is 1 over\n 256. Let's put all of these over a common denominator. So a quarter becomes 64 over 256, a sixteenth is 16 over 256, and if we add them all together we get 81 over\n over 256, which is indeed the area of a square with sides of length 9 sixteenths. We have found a rational solution to Diophantis' sum of squares problem. The first\n To find the solution\n we used new seemingly absurd numbers, p-addics, infinite digits going off to the left of the decimal point, implying an infinite expansion of increasing powers of three. Then we used the geometric series formula to find that an infinite string of ones in three\n The chaotic notation is actually negative 1 half. This works even though the ratio of each term to the previous one is 3. So by common sense the series shouldn't have converged. It should have blown up to infinity. So the real question is how did this work?\n Well, the key idea is that the geometry of the P-addicts is totally different from that of the real numbers. In fact, they don't exist on a number line at all. One way to visualize them is with something like a growing tree. For the 3-addict\n integers we've been working with, three base cylinders represent the unit's digit, or x0, being 0, 1, or 2. Above each cylinder is a trio of shorter cylinders corresponding to the 3's digit, or x1. And we continue\n in this way forever, making an infinite, triply branching tree. Looking down from above, it looks like a Sierpinski gasket. Each 3-adic number is represented here as a stack of infinite cylinders that get shorter and\n narrower as they go up. And this actually reflects the relative contributions each successive cylinder makes to the value of the 3-adic number. Contrary to what you'd expect, the coefficients multiplying higher powers of 3 actually make finer\n and finer adjustments. So when we calculated successive coefficients to solve Diophantis's squares problem, we were actually zooming in more and more accurately on the solution. This is the feeling of slowly zooming in\n Normally, we think of the size of a number as being determined approximately, at least, by how many digits it has to the left of the decimal point. But here, all the numbers have infinitely many digits. So, people\n We'll realize that to determine the distance between two numbers, we need to look at the lowest level of the tower where they disagree. If two numbers differ in the units place, we say their separation is 1. But if they differ in the\n 27's place, we say they differ not by 27, but by 1 over 27. In the world of peatics, what we're used to thinking of as big is small, and vice versa.\n Let's say S1, which will be some sequence like 2 times 1 plus 1 times 3 plus 0 times 3 squared plus 1 times 3 cubed.\n plus two times three to the fourth and so on. We'll be close to another number with a similar expansion except at the let's say three to the third place I change a digit.\n and then it doesn't matter what I do after that. The digits can be all the same or all different. These two numbers will say that their distance, their three-adic distance, is roughly of size the first place where they go wrong. So this will be 3 to the minus 3.\n Am I supposed to think of the threes as kind of like the bigger they are the smaller the numbers that they're multiplying or something? Exactly. In the three-addicts we want numbers to be close when they agree up to\n It turns out that if you do this crazy thing, swap big and small, all the other laws of\n work in the usual way. This is why the geometric sum worked out even though we thought it would blow up to infinity.\n numbers became useful, just like square roots of negative numbers became useful. This feels even crazier than negative numbers or square roots of negatives. Just because it's less familiar. And you can prove this notion of size\n fits the criteria you would want for an absolute value.\n itself zero. So that's called positive definite. So it should be multiplicative if I take x times y, and I multiply those two, that should be the same as the absolute value of x times the absolute value of y. And I want one more property, which is that if you add\n x and y. Should that be the same as the absolute value of x plus the absolute value of y? No, but it should be at most the sum, right? This is the triangle inequality. So we have multiplicativity, positive defineness, and the triangle inequality. You give me only these three very abstract\n I can extract things and I can prove that your function is in fact the usual absolute value or one of these P-adic absolute values or the thing that gives 0 to 0 and 1 to everything else. So that's the trivial absolute value.\n This geometry makes the P-addicts much more disconnected when compared to the real numbers. And this is actually useful for finding rational solutions\n to an equation. There are many fewer peatic solutions in a neighborhood of a rational solution. If we tried the same strategy of solving Diophantus' squares problem digit by digit in the real numbers, it would be doomed to fail, because there are\n simply too many real solutions all over the place. They get in the way. In a groundbreaking pair of papers in 1995, one by Andrew Wiles and another by Wiles and Richard Taylor, they finally proved Fermat's\n theorem, but the proof could not possibly have been the one Fermat alluded to in the margin, because it made heavy use of the\n it to switch to the prime 5. And this is literally called the 3-5 trick. There was something that worked for the prime 3 most of the time, but sometimes it didn't work, and when it didn't work for the prime 3, it did work for the prime 5. Each prime gives you a completely unrelated number system, just like these number systems are unrelated to the real\n numbers. There is a great quote I like by a Japanese mathematician, Kazuya Kato. He says,\n see the stars, even though they are just as important. Well I hope this video has revealed at least a glimpse of those stars to you.

            "transcription": "This is the most dangerous problem in mathematics. One that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erd\u0151s, a famous mathematician,\n mathematician said mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions. Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're going to apply two rules if the\n number is odd, we multiply by 3 and add 1. 3 times 7 is 21, plus 1 is 22. If the number is even, we divide by 2. 22 divided by 2 is 11. Now we keep applying these\n two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by 2, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by 2, 26,\n still even. Divide by 2, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39, add 1, and that's 40, which is even. So we divide by 2, 20, divide by 2, 10, divide by 2, 5, odd. Multiply by 3,\n 16, add 1, 16, divide by 2, that's 8, and then 4, 2, and 1. Now 1 is odd, so we multiply by 3 and add 1, which equals 4, but 4 goes to 2 goes to 1, so we're\n a loop and the lowest number is 1. Now the conjecture is this, every positive integer if you apply these rules will eventually end up in the 4-2-1 loop. This is commonly called the Collatz conjecture.\n after German mathematician Lothar Kollatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Haase's algorithm, the Syracuse problem,\n and simply 3n plus 1. Why is 3x plus 1 so famous? Among professional mathematicians maybe it's not famous but infamous in the sense that if someone actually admits in public that they're working on it then there's something wrong with\n with them. The numbers you get by applying 3x plus one are called hailstone numbers because they go up and down like hailstones in a thunder cloud. But eventually they all fall down to one.\n or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start 26 meters above the ground, and if you apply 3x plus 1, it rises up as high as 40 meters,\n and in total it takes 10 steps to get to 1. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all the way up\n to 9,232. As an altitude, that is higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps for 27\n to get down to 1 and end up in the 4-2-1 loop. The paths that different numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other, so how do you even start to make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, math\n mathematicians struggled.\n The first time I met him, I was a senior in college and he pulled me aside and he said, don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career,\n do not start spending time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while to establish yourself. Alex Kontarovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the past\n Here is the sequence of a large number chosen at random.\n The graph peaks, and then drops so low that you can't really see what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph with a downward trend. It looks kind of like the stock market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence.\n Both are examples of geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up. Tails, it goes down.\n 3x plus 1 is just like the random wiggles of the stock market. Over long enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x plus 1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x plus 1 is by looking at the leading digit of each number\n in a sequence. Here are the hailstone numbers starting with 3 as the seed, and we can count up how many numbers start with a 1, how many start with a 2, how many start with a 3, and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that\n starts with 4, that's a short one, and for the sequences that start with 5, 6, and 7. Again, for each sequence we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, 1 through 9, and adding that to\n our histogram. If you keep doing this for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the most common leading digit.\n 30% of all numbers start with 1. Around 17.5% start with 2, 12% start with 3, and the frequency decreases for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the numbers start with 9.\n Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x plus 1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries to the value of companies, all the physical constants and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few.\n The distribution is known as Benford's Law. And it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on your income tax forms obey Benford's Law, then you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something.\n In some sections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude, as they do for 3x plus 1.\n whether all numbers will end up in the 4-2-1 loop or not. For that, we need a different sort of analysis. At first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x plus 1, all numbers should end up at 1. I mean, consider\n that there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the\n catch. Every time you multiply an odd number by 3 and then add 1, it will always become an even number. And that means the next step is to divide by 2. So odd numbers are not actually tripled by 3x plus 1, they're increased by a factor of about\n 3 over 2. I'm neglecting the plus 1 because it's insignificant for large numbers. And 3 halves is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one odd number in a sequence to the next.\n odd number. After multiplying by 3 and adding 1, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by 2 brings you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time, you can divide by 4 before you get to the next odd number. So\n For a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be three-fourths of its initial value. An eighth of the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number. And a sixteenth of the time, you can divide by sixteen, and so on.\n the geometric mean you find on average to get from one odd number to the next one you multiply by 3 over 4 which is less than 1. So statistically speaking 3x plus 1 sequences are more likely to shrink than grow.\n Take 341 for example. Multiply by 3 and add 1, you get 1024. Which you can divide by 2, and then divide by 2 again, and again, and again, and again. 10 times in total,\n until you're down to 1. One way to visualize these paths of numbers in 3x plus 1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree, or a\n series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all the way out to infinity eventually flows into the massive\n river of 421. Some mathematicians have modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number, anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you\n end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful, organic looking shapes. Now there are two ways\n the conjecture could be false. There could be a number somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers.\n possibility is there exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far no loop or sequence that shoots off to infinity has been found.\n And not for lack of trying. Mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to 2 to the 68. That's 295 quintillion 147 quadrillion 905 trillion 179 billion 352 million\n We know for certain that every single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly 300 quintillion numbers and none of them\n In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than 421 must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So it seems pretty likely that the conjecture is true, but\n But this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seed's sequence on the y-axis. Now if you can show that in every 3x plus\n sequence, there is a number that is smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven the Collatz conjecture. Because whatever number you pick, you know it will at some point get smaller, and that smaller number as a seed also gets smaller, and\n so on down to 1, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the 4-2-1 loop. This has not yet been shown. But in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show\n that almost all callout sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than x to the power of .869, and then in 1994, it was further lowered\n In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up\n under the curve goes to 1. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x plus 1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all\n numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x, so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise as slowly as you like, so log x is an example\n or log log x works too, or log log log log x. What this means is for almost all numbers you can guarantee that there is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk you gave\n in 2020, Terry Tao said, this is about as close as one can get to the callouts conjecture without actually solving it. This is an impressive result, but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true?\n Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is looking for counter examples.\n to prove. And I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counter example. And then I realized what the correct statement should have been. And then a month later I proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counter examples than we're currently spending.\n Remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops\n at 100,000, but not all numbers can be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example, climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just shoot off two\n infinity, and it would take only one to disprove the conjecture. Or some set of numbers could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is only one loop, 421, but something\n Something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x plus 1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low values like\n Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture is Terry Tao's proof that almost all\n numbers have a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between 1 and 100 are\n perfect squares? The answer is 10. So 10% of numbers up to 100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between 1 and 1000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31, so only 3.5.\n 1% of the numbers up to 1000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the smaller this percentage becomes. Such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect\n Now we've tested by brute force all numbers up to 2 to the 68 and they all obey the call-outs conjectured.\n And you might be thinking that we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers, 2 to the 68 is nothing. I mean the Paulia Conjecture, proposed in 1919 by George Paulia, asserted that the majority of natural numbers\n up to any given number have an odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Hasselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counter example. What's remarkable is the value of this counter example was 1.8\n 845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to the 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x plus 1. One way to think about 3x plus 1 is as though it's a simple program run on a Turing machine. The\n number is the input to the machine. So in this picture 2 to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has tried\n transformed every input up to this 68 square tape down to 1 should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you like, so long\n as it is finite. If you want a number that increases by 3 over 2 5 consecutive times, you can calculate that number. If you want a number that climbs by 3 over 2 10 times in a row, or 100 times, or 1000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after\n the finite section you specify you have no more control and every number that has ever been tested always falls to one. If there is a counterexample it's virtually impossible that someone's gonna guess it and the space of all possibilities is too\n big to search exhaustively by brute force.\n then this point of view I realized that like what do we really know do we what what it's very hard to prove a theorem that's false and so could it be that everyone's struggling to prove this\n thing because it's not actually true and 2 to the 60 is not a lot of evidence and even the statistical version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory somewhere\n in the 3x plus 1 sequence. Of course there is another option and that is that we'll never know. That the problem is undecidable. In 1987 John Conway created a generalization of 3x plus 1.\n It was a mathematical machine that he called Fractran, and he was able to show this machine is Turing complete, which means it can do anything a modern computer can do. But it also means that it's subject to the halting problem, a chance that the\n machine never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x plus 1 is also subject to the halting problem, but it is possible that given what we know, we may never prove the call-outs conjecture true or false.\n You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of stuff and there it's level. It's a lie They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on Really? We can't solve this really You know, it just shows\n The math is hard. If anything, it shows that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all these other problems. For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as these incredibly regular things full of\n patterns, symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly in the choral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,\n looking and thus far intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to this structure or is there some unique filament, a spindly little thread that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it\n so hard to tell. I think that's why Paul Erdos said, mathematics is not yet ripe enough for such questions. What I love about 3x plus one is it's a\n It's a problem almost anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure things out for yourself is the best way to learn. Which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now recently, Brilliant have upped their interactivity.\n For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem solving.\n It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go. And Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more challenging over time. There's always a helpful tip or explanation.\n that takes your understanding to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are relevant to all areas of STEM, and algorithm fundamentals for anyone interested\n in coding.\n I will put that link down in the description.

            "transcription": "In 1982, there was one SAT question that every single student got wrong. Here it is. In the figure above, the radius of circle A is one third the radius of circle B. Starting from the position she\n As shown in the figure, circle A rolls around circle B. At the end of how many revolutions of circle A will the center of the circle first reach its starting point? Is it A, three halves?\n E3, C6, D9 halves, or E9. SAT questions are designed to be quick. This exam gave students 30 minutes to solve 25 problems, so about a minute\n each, so feel free to pause the video here and try to solve it. What is your answer? I'll tell you right now that option B or 3 is not correct. When I first saw this problem\n my intuitive answer was B, because the circumference of a circle is just 2 pi r, and since the radius of circle B is 3 times the radius of circle A, the circumference of circle B must also be 3 times the circumference\n of circle A. So logically it should take three full rotations of circle A to roll around circle B. So my answer was three. This is wrong, but so are answers in\n A, C, D, and E. The reason no one got question 17 correct is that the test writers themselves got it wrong. They also thought the answer was 3, so the actual correct answer\n answer was not listed as an option on\n people's entire futures. As a newspaper from the time stated, if you mess up on your SAT tests, you can forget it. Your life as a productive citizen is over. Hang it up, son.\n test takers, just three students wrote about the error to the College Board, the company that administers the SAT. Shivin Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Youngrace. I did a lot of math problems when I was young.\n The three students were confident none of the listed answers were correct, and their letters showed it.\n The director at the testing service recalled, they didn't say they had come up with possible alternative answers or that maybe we were wrong. They said flat out, you're wrong, and they proved it.\n mostly said, and no one cares. I wrote a letter to the educational testing service. It was a little while later. They called us and said I was correct. Here is their argument.\n The simplest version of this problem is with two identical coins. These have the exact same circumference, so by our initial logic, this coin should rotate exactly once as it rolls around the other. So let's try it.\n Okay. But wait, we can see it's already right side up at the halfway point. So if we finish rolling it around the other coin, it'll have rotated not once, but twice.\n Even though the coins are the exact same size, there are no tricks here. You can try it for yourself and I'll do it again slowly. That's one.\n 2. This is known as the coin rotation paradox. This paradox also applies to question 17. I've made a two-scale model of\n the problem. One useful tip for standardized tests, even though they say their images are not to scale, they almost always are. So when we roll circle A around circle B, we can see that it rotates\n once, twice, three times, and four times in total.\n The correct answer to this question is actually 4. Once again, the circle rotates one more time than we expected. To understand this, let's wrap this larger circle in some ribbon.\n and I'll make it the same length as the circumference. And then I will stick it down to the table as a straight line. I'm adding some paper here, so there's something for this to roll on.\n And now rolls one, two, three times. What's happening when we turn this straight path into a circular one is that circle A is now rolling the length of the circumference and\n and it's going around a circle. The shape of the circular path itself makes circle A do an additional rotation to return to its starting point. So this is the general solution to the problem. Find the ratio between the circumferences of circle B\n and circle A, and then add one rotation to account for the circular path traveled. But there is a way to correctly get three. Let's count the rotations of circle A from the perspective of circle B looking out at A.\n We can see circle A rotates one, two, three times.\n matter which circle you are looking from. To circle A, it also rotates three times to come back to its starting position around circle B. Similarly, from the perspective of the coins, we can see that the outer coin only rotates once as it rolls around\n the inner coin. Using the perspective of a circle is just like turning the circle's circumference into a straight line. It's only as external observers that we actually see the outer circle travel a circular path back to its\n starting point, giving us the one extra rotation. But there's even another answer. If you look closely at question 17, it asks how many\n Now, in astronomy, the definition of a revolution is precise. It's a complete orbit around another body. The Earth revolves around the Sun, which is different from it rotating.\n about its axis. So by the astronomical definition of a revolution, circle A only revolves around circle B once, it goes around one time. Now other definitions of a revolution do include the motion of an object\n After\n Reviewing the letters from the students, the College Board publicly admitted their mistake a few weeks later and nullified the question for all test takers.\n But there's more to the explanation.\n It's easy to get an intuitive reason, but it's really hard to formally prove that the answer is four. I could give you some proofs if you want. Well, that would be wonderful. I think that would be, we'd appreciate that for sure.\n a whiteboard because I'm a mathematician. So I just happen to have a whiteboard here. Hold on. Can you see that? Yep. It turns out that the amount the small circle rotates is always the same as the distance the center\n travels. All right, so why is this true? Suppose you had a camera and the camera was always pointed at the center. So in your movie it looks like the center doesn't move. In the real world the center is going around the circle. Let's\n say it's going at some speed v. What's the velocity of this point? It's zero. And that's because it's rolling without slipping. If it had any component in that direction, that's what slipping would be. I mean, this is something I think they should have spelled out\n the problem, but when you change your frame of reference, the relative velocities don't change. In the movie, the center always has velocity zero, so this point would have to have velocity negative v. So that means the\n The speed that this is turning is the same as the speed the center is moving. So if they always have the same speed, they have to go the same total distance. The total distance this turns has to be the same as the total distance the center moves.\n problem the center of the small circle goes around a circle of radius 4. So the total distance that the center moves is 8 pi. What's the total amount that the small circle rotates? It rotates four times.\n And this is always true. Take a circle rolling\n without slipping on any surface, from a polygon to a blob, on the outside or the inside, the distance traveled by the center of the circle is equal to the amount the circle has rotated. So just find this distance and divide it by the circle's\n circumference to get how many rotations it's made. This is an even more general solution than our answer to the coin paradox, where we just took our expected answer, which we'll call n, and added 1, and it reveals where this shortcut comes from.\n If a circle is rolling continuously around a shape, the circle's center goes around the outside, increasing its distance traveled by exactly one circumference of the circle. So the distance traveled by the circle's center is just the perimeter of the shape plus the circle's circumference.\n When we ultimately divide this by the circle circumference to get the total number of rotations, we get n plus 1. If a circle is rolling continuously within a shape, the distance travelled by the circle's center decreases by one circumference of the circle, making the total number\n rotations n-1. If the circle is rolling along a flat line, the distance traveled by the circle's center is equal to the length of the line, which divided by the circle's circumference is just n. This general principle\n When we count 365 days going by in a year, 365.24 to be precise, we say we're just counting\n how many rotations the Earth makes in one orbit around the Sun. But it's not that simple. All this counting is done from the perspective of you on Earth. To an external observer, they'll see the Earth do one extra rotation to account for its circular\n path around the sun. So while we count 365.24 days in a year, they count 366.24 days in a year. This is called a sidereal year. Sidereal meaning with respect to the\n stars, where an external observer would be. But what happens to that one extra day? A normal solar day is the time it takes the sun to be directly above you again on Earth. But the Earth isn't just rotating, it's\n orbiting the sun at the same time. So, in a 24 hour solar day, Earth actually has to rotate more than 360 degrees in order to bring the sun directly overhead again. But Earth's orbit is negligible to distant stars. To see a star\n are directly overhead again, Earth just needs to rotate exactly 360 degrees. So while it takes the Sun exactly 24 hours to be directly above you again,\n A star at night takes only 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to be above you again. That's a sidereal day. This explains where the extra day goes in the sidereal year. If we start\n a solar day and a sidereal day at the same time, we'd see them slowly diverge throughout the year. After 6 months, the sidereal day would be 12 hours ahead of the solar day, meaning that noon would be midnight, and it would keep moving\n up until it's finally one full day ahead of the solar day, at which point a new year and orbit begins. 365.24 days that are each 24 hours long are equal to 367.\n 6.24 days that are each 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds long. So it makes no sense to use sidereal time on earth because 6 months down the line day and night would be\n completely swapped. But equally, it's useless to use solar time while tracking objects in space, because the region you're observing would shift between say 10pm one night and 10pm the next night. So instead, astronomers use sidereal time\n for their telescopes to ensure that they're looking at the same region of space each night. And all geostationary satellites, like those used for communication or navigation, they use sidereal time to keep their orbits locked with the Earth's rotation.\n So, the Quain Paradox actually explains the difference between how we track time on Earth and how we track time in the universe. The rescoring of the 1982\n With question 17 scrapped, students' scores were scaled without it, moving their final result up or down by 10 points out of 800. Now while that doesn't seem like much, some universities and scholarships use strict\n minimum test score cutoffs. And as one admissions expert put it, there are instances, even if we do not consider them justified, in which 10 points can have an impact on a person's educational opportunities. It might not keep someone out of law school, but it might affect which one\n one he could go to. This mistake didn't only cost points off the exam, according to the testing service, rescoring would cost them over $100,000, money that came out of the pockets of test takers.\n The 2017 circle problem was far from the last error on the SAT. But errors are likely the least of their concerns these days. I mean, the SAT is slowly becoming a thing of the past. After COVID-19, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges\n in the US no longer require any standardized testing. And that 1982 exam? Well, it didn't turn out too badly for some. How did you do on your math SAT, if I can ask? I got an 800. Even before the\n that it was clear I was going to go into math. I did math competitions. I did, I really liked math. Do you end up writing any math questions these days? A while back I wrote problems for a math competition. And were you careful with how you wrote them, the wording and\n I hope so. I tried.

            "transcription": "As an Australian Canadian, the Fahrenheit temperature scale has always seemed a bit arbitrary to me. I mean, why does water freeze at 32 degrees? Why that integer? And what exactly does zero represent? According to many sources, the Fahrenheit scale was defined by setting zero degrees\n equal to the temperature of an ice, salt, and water mixture, and 100 degrees being roughly equal to human body temperature. But that isn't true. The real story is much more interesting and scientific. August 14th, 1701,\n was almost certainly the worst day in the life of 15 year old Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. On that day, both of his parents died suddenly from mushroom poisoning. And he was sent from Poland, where he lived, to Amsterdam to become an apprentice\n bookkeeper. But Fahrenheit couldn't stand his apprenticeship and ran away so many times that his employer put out a warrant for his arrest. Traveling from city to city around Europe, he became fascinated with scientific instruments and in particular, thermometers.\n In 1708, possibly seeking help with a warrant, Fahrenheit met with the mayor of Copenhagen, who happened to be the famous astronomer Ole Romer. Romer is known for observing the eclipses of Jupiter's moons, and realizing that variations in the timing of those eclipses was\n caused by the time it took light to reach Earth. In other words, he found a way to accurately measure the finite speed of light. But more pertinent to this story, in 1702, Rohmer was housebound after breaking his leg, and to pass the time he devised a brand new temperature scale\n with the freezing point of water at 7.5 degrees and body temperature at 22.5 degrees. Now this might seem odd until you consider that Romer wanted the boiling point of water to be 60 degrees. As an astronomer, he had experience dividing things by 60. So if you\n So if you take this scale, divide it in half, in half again, and in half once more, you find the freezing point of water 1 eighth up the scale and human body temperature 3 eighths up the scale. So at their meeting in 1708, Fahrenheit learned of Rohmer's temperature scale and adopted it\n as his own, adjusting it slightly because he found it inconvenient and inelegant on account of the fractional numbers. So he scaled them up to 8 and 24. And this is the original Fahrenheit scale. He produced thermometers for some time\n using this scale, but then at some later point Fahrenheit multiplied all numbers on his scale by 4, setting freezing point to the now familiar 32 and body temperature to 96. It's unclear exactly why he did this. He may just have\n wanted finer precision in his measurements. But I think there was a better reason. You see, Fahrenheit was an excellent instrument maker. His thermometers agreed with each other precisely at a time when that was unheard of. He pioneered the use of mercury as a measure\n liquid which has the benefit of a much higher boiling point than the alcohol used in most other thermometers at the time and for these accomplishments he was inducted into the British Royal Society and we know that he read the works of Newton, Boyle and Hooke in which he would have come across the idea that a one degree\n increase in temperature could correspond to a specific fractional increase in the volume of the measuring liquid. And today, a 1 degree Fahrenheit increase in temperature increases the volume of mercury by exactly one part in 10,000. Is this just a coincidence?\n Well, we'll probably never know for sure because as an instrument maker, Fahrenheit was very secretive about his methods. But I think the data strongly suggests that this was the case. So what exactly did zero represent on the scales of Fahrenheit and Romer?\n By many accounts, it's the temperature of a salt, ice, and water mixture. The only problem is, there are different descriptions of these mixtures, and none of them actually produces the temperature they're supposed to. More likely, I think they picked the coldest temperature in winter, set that as zero, and later\n He used ice and brine to calibrate new thermometers. In his day, the Fahrenheit thermometer was the best you could get. But now his scale is only used regularly in the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Belize, oh, and the United States of America.\n So maybe it's time we all adopted the global scale of temperature, Celsius, which by the way wasn't invented by Celsius at all. Hey, so that was something that looked like a\n bit different. This video was animated by Marcelo Ascani, I've got a link to his channel in the description. You know I became really fascinated with temperature scales after I saw the original Celsius thermometer, you can see that video here.

            "transcription": "Welcome to beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia. This is actually where I grew up, just across that water. And I remember when I was a teenager here, I wanted to be a filmmaker. And so what did I do? Well, I\n I found a film director with a strange name who lived in Vancouver. I saw her on the cover of this magazine and then I just looked up her number in the phone book and the white pages because that's how you did back in the\n year 2000 and I gave her a call and she said she was on the other line but she'd call me back and strangely enough she did call me back and it was amazing I got to chat to her about filmmaking I guess what I really wanted was for someone else to be able\n provide me with an opportunity to get on set, to get some experience in that industry and show me what it's like. I just want to know and it's so hard when you're on the outside to figure out how to break in. You just want to reach out to someone who knows and say, help me\n with this. There is a psychological phenomenon known as learned helplessness and the experiments conducted way back decades ago that established this phenomenon were really quite terrible. What they would do is take dogs and\n for some of them at least they would force them to endure a punishment. For example, they would receive electric shocks and there was nothing they could do to prevent those shocks. For other dogs there were actually little levers or a fence they could hop over that would stop the shocks. Now later on they took all of those\n dogs and they tested them again but in environments where every one of those dogs had the opportunity to avoid the shocks by taking some action. Now what was found was those dogs that had been forced to endure the shocks and had no way of stopping them just\n They kind of came to accept the shocks, even when there were actions that they could take which would stop them. So this is learned helplessness. They have learned that there's nothing they can do to stop that uncomfortable situation.\n A related study carried out with adults where they were trying to complete a task except there was this distracting noise playing. Now some of the adults had the ability to turn off that noise whereas others did not, it was not under their control. And when you look at the performance\n the adults who had the control to turn off the noise performed better even when they didn't actually exercise that control so they just let the noise play but the knowledge that they could shut it off if they wanted to made them perform better. I have worked a\n at many jobs now, some very menial and some more managerial or entrepreneurial like I was basically running the show. And what I've found is that there's kind of this divide between employees and managers. When you're an employee and you're assigned to do something, you try\n to do it as best you've been shown, but if you hit a roadblock you kind of stop and you go to your manager or supervisor and you say, hey, what do I do now? Now I've done that before. I've done it when I was a research assistant. I'd get some result, I didn't really know what was going on, and I'd just take it to my supervisor.\n would say, oh, well, why don't you try this? And that suggestion that they made was always one that I knew, or, you know, I could have thought of if I just spent five minutes on it, or if I really wanted to achieve that goal. But instead, I just had\n I had this mentality, like, I'm carrying out this task and when I get stuck I'm just gonna ask someone else. You know, there's a story that Tim Ferriss tells. He's the guy who wrote The Four Hour Workweek, which is a book I would recommend. But he went and visited this university\n and he challenged the students that he was talking to. He said, look, I will give you $25,000 and a trip around the world for anyone who shows that they have made contact by some sort of signature or email or letter or something with either\n Jennifer Lopez, Bill Clinton, who I think at the time was the president, possibly, and JD Salinger, who's the most reclusive writer of all time. And did anyone do it? Nope. Not a one. Now the following year,\n He went back to the same university and in addition to making the challenge, he told them the story from the previous year that no one had actually done it. No one had really tried. In that year, six people actually\n actually achieved his challenge. The point being, you need to find a way around the learned helplessness mentality, the employee mentality, and find a way to realize that things that seem impossible can be accomplished.\n if you really accept that you have control of these things, that it's not outside of your control. There may be a question we should ask is, does our school system promote learned helplessness? Do we force kids to\n suffer punishment that they really can't change time and time and time again and then we expose them to a world and say now you go out and and do what you want to do I think to a certain degree we are doing that you know school is for a lot of kids just\n a weird and unusual kind of punishment. And I guess it's no wonder that they learn that, you know, there's things beyond their control because school is kind of about taking control away from kids. You know, for the dogs,\n How did they get the dogs to overcome their learned helplessness and actually get away from the shocks they were receiving? They tried treats and encouragements, but it didn't work. They had to physically move the dogs away from the area where they were being shocked.\n at least twice before they would actually learn that they had the power to change their fate, that they didn't have to suffer that kind of punishment again and again. But with you, I feel like just letting you know\n that this thing exists might be enough to change the way you view your life and your opportunities. Let's talk briefly about career paths. I applied to acting school three times\n and was rejected three times. I applied to film school twice and was rejected twice. I think what I was looking for out of those institutions was a surefire way to get to the career that I wanted. I was basically doing the same thing that I was doing\n when I asked that director in Vancouver to help me out, to get me on set. I was asking for someone else to make this possible for me. I mean there's a small number of jobs where the career path is clearly laid out. You want to be a doctor, you have to go to med school. You want to be a lawyer,\n where you have to go to law school. You want to be an academic, you have to do a PhD. But I think there's a much larger group of careers where you really have to figure out a way to do it yourself. And that's the whole point. That is the whole\n challenge. You feel like you're not in control and you want someone else to help you get that control or get in the place where you need to be. But no one can really help you. Just like that director couldn't really help me get where I need to be, I cannot help other people get where\n they need to be, you really have it all up to you. I mean, you have to demonstrate that you can do what you want to do. You know, there is this quote, grant me the serenity to accept\n Now my point is, when you're contemplating the things that you can and cannot change, err on the side of thinking that\n you can change much more than you can. Because often you will be able to. I mean, everything seems impossible until it's done. That's a Nelson\n Mandela quote, which I think is kind of appropriate in this circumstance. Things look a lot more impossible than they are. And really, it's up to you to find out.\n Hey, as you can tell, books have had a huge impact on my life and how I see the world. And when I'm traveling, I like to listen to them as audiobooks because it's just more convenient on planes and trains. And there's actually one I want\n recommend to you, it is called Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely. It's about how humans don't really behave rationally even when we think that's what we're doing.

            "transcription": "Part of this video was sponsored by HBO Max and their new show, Raised by Wolves. There's a place in the New Mexico desert, open to the public for just two days out of the year. But I got to visit by myself with only a small film crew.\n This is the Trinity bomb test site where on July 16th 1945 at exactly 529 and 45 seconds in the morning the first nuclear bomb was\n exploded. The test was called Trinity. There was actually a tower here that stood a hundred feet, or about 30 meters. The list of people who witnessed the\n The test reads like a who's who of 20th century physics. Fermi, Feynman, Oppenheimer, von Neumann. But the test was top secret. The general public weren't to know. But how do you hide a huge nuclear explosion?\n Well, the Albuquerque Tribune published a statement claiming it was a large but accidental conventional explosion. It wasn't just the general public who were kept in the dark. The governor of New Mexico was not even aware that Trinity was a nuclear test until after the bombing\n coming of Hiroshima. Even then, details about the blast were scarce. But Kodak, the film company based on the other side of the country in New York State, well, they figured out what was happening. It all started with some defective x-ray\n film. Kodak found when they developed unused film, it showed tens or even a hundred little dark spots. The film had been exposed to radiation even though it had never been taken out of its packaging. This was actually not a new problem. During World War\n In 1902, radium was used extensively to make glow-in-the-dark dials, flight instruments, and watches. Radium glows because it is radioactive. It gives off alpha particles. Now, some of this radium ended up on paper and cardboard at these factories.\n Because supplies were scarce, leftover paper products were salvaged and recycled, leading small amounts of radium to end up in the general paper supply. And when this paper was used to package up Kodak film, radiation from radium would expose the film before it was\n ever used. And it was such a problem that Kodak altered their supply chain, carefully selecting just a few paper mills where they could strictly control the raw materials. One of the mills was in Vincennes, Indiana on the Wabash River. It made strawboard, which was in\n inserted between sheets of x-ray film. Now for months, this strawboard was working perfectly, until a batch, manufactured on August 6, 1945, started to cause spots to appear on the x-ray film. So Julian Webb, a scientist at Kodak, was tasked with solving the\n problem. So he punched out little holes of strawboard behind where the film had been exposed and then he measured the alpha particles coming off that material. But the level was not appreciably higher than background and this ruled out radium and the other nat\n occurring isotopes of uranium, thorium, and actinium, all alpha emitters. But when he measured beta radiation, he found significant activity. This matched what he saw on the film. The radiation penetrated several layers, something beta particles can do but not\n alpha. And over a period of months, he measured the half-life of the radioactive substance, finding it was only about 30 days. This half-life combined with the energy of the beta particles led Webb to conclude that the radioactive contaminant was most likely Serium-148.\n 1941, an isotope that could only have come from a nuclear fission explosion. What's more, the same contaminant appeared in paper from a nether of Kodak's mills, this one hundreds of kilometers away\n in Tamah, Iowa. So how did Sirium-141 end up in that strawboard? Well, when that first atomic bomb exploded in the New Mexico desert, the plutonium core underwent a fission chain reaction. Plutonium nuclei ripped in two\n releasing energy and more neutrons to continue the chain reaction. But vision is a messy process. It doesn't always split the nucleus into the same products. Instead, hundreds of different nuclei are produced, virtually all of them radioactive.\n and they are carried up into the stratosphere with the mushroom cloud and dispersed on air currents whichever way the wind blows. In this case, they traveled over a thousand kilometers ending up over Iowa and Indiana. Here, rain captured some of these radioactive particles\n causing them to fall out of the sky, hence the term radioactive fallout. This radioactive material ended up in rivers like the ones that run beside the two Kodak paper mills, which used that river water to make their paper. So that's how Sirium-141\n ended up fogging Kodak's x-ray film and exposing the US nuclear secret. Now, word of Kodak's detection made it back to scientists at Los Alamos who were intrigued and wanted to know more. A consultant wrote to Webb to find out how much radioactivity per square mile\n he detected and the size of the particles which fell and the half-life of the activity. Although Webb completed his experiments by the end of 1945, he only published them in Physical Review in 1949. And that's because I'm sure he recognized just how sensitive\n sensitive his findings were. After all, he himself had worked on the Manhattan Project at Berkeley and Oak Ridge using electromagnetic techniques to separate uranium isotopes. What was clear to Kodak was that they needed to take steps to protect their film.\n and so they installed air samplers to monitor for fallout in the air intakes of their buildings.\n to some extent contaminate the atmosphere. Now the US government was aware they needed to carefully consider where to test nuclear bombs. What we need is a site closer to our stateside laboratories and available air support. Somewhere in the\n After Trinity, the Manhattan Project's chief of radiological safety, Stafford Warren, recommended tests be conducted at least 150 miles from civilian populations. In 1948, an Air Force meteorologist\n biologist, Colonel Holzman, told the site selection committee that a location on the east coast would be best, because otherwise the prevailing westerly winds across the US would spread the fallout across the country. The site they chose was Nevada, almost as far west as you\n can go in just 100 miles from Las Vegas. The rationale was this site was closer to weapons labs so it would accelerate their development. After the first bomb test there in 1951, Kodak detected fallout at their headquarters in Rochester, New York.\n After a snowstorm, Geiger counters read 25 times the normal background. So Kodak threatened to sue the US government for the considerable amount of damage to our products resulting from the Nevada tests or from any further atomic energy tests.\n Instead of a lawsuit, the two sides came to an agreement. The Atomic Energy Commission would give Kodak, and indeed the entire photographic industry, advanced warning about upcoming tests and where the fallout was likely to end up given meteorological models.\n turn, the company agreed to keep quiet about radioactive fallout. And from 1951 until 1963, the US conducted 100 above-ground nuclear tests in Nevada. The resulting mixture of radioactive nuclei was blown, as predicted, across\n When these atoms fell on agricultural land, they were eaten by livestock or taken up in crops and they became part of the food supply. Radioactive iodine-131 eaten by cows is passed on to humans through their milk.\n and this is particularly problematic because iodine is concentrated by the body in the thyroid gland and children with small developing thyroids drink the most milk. It's estimated that the nuclear tests led to tens of thousands of extra cases of\n of thyroid cancer. The Atomic Energy Commission wasn't too worried about iodine-131 because it has a radioactive half-life of only 8 days. It decays quickly. They were more concerned about strontium-90, which has a half-life of almost 30 years.\n Strontium-90, because of a unique combination of properties, probably represents the greatest danger. Strontium-90 behaves biochemically like calcium, so when ingested it ends up in our teeth and bones, and as it emits ionizing beta radiation, it can\n cause bone cancer, cancer in the surrounding tissues, or leukemia. In what's become known as the Baby Tooth Survey, scientists in St. Louis collected up 320,000 teeth between 1950 and 1970. They found that kids born in 1963\n had 50 times more strontium in their baby teeth than those born in 1950. Presently existing evidence indicates that fallout has caused only a small increase in background radiation and correspondingly only a minute increase\n In reality, both iodine-131 and strontium-90, plus other radioactive isotopes in the fallout, almost certainly increased rates of cancer and other diseases in the US population. This is borne out by studies showing correlation\n between rates of disease and radioactive isotope uptake. The graph shows a peak in 1964, just after the partial nuclear test ban treaty was signed in 1963. It banned nuclear tests in the atmosphere, underwater, and in outer space, leaving only\n tests. A central aim of the treaty was to address growing public concern over the scale of nuclear tests and the resulting radioactive fallout. When the US Senate finally held a hearing on the matter almost 50 years later in 1997, the agreement with Kodak was\n sharply criticized, especially by Senator Tom Harkin, who said,\n children in these areas. The government protected roles of film, but not the lives of our kids. There's something wrong with this picture. And I think the main problem was that in the 40s and 50s, not enough was known about the biological effects of radioactive fallout.\n And so often a gene changes or mutates and a characteristic of the organism is altered. We do not know the exact process by which mutations occur. Cancers took years or even decades to appear.\n fallout models predicted a more uniform and therefore less concentrated spread of contaminants. When students in Albany, New York measured a thousand times background levels after a heavy rainstorm, well the Atomic Energy Commission's report about the event called it an\n interesting example of a small area of very intense fallout. Now, concerned with alarming people unnecessarily in downwind communities, the Atomic Energy Commission's approach was to limit as much as possible the information that was shared. Their conclusion is\n it seems, was that people are less sensitive to radiation than film is. So the studies of radioactive fallout remain inconclusive. What is certain is that 1945 marked the start of a new era, no\n radioactive fallout before then and lots after it. And scientists have shown you can use this to detect wine forgeries. Any wine made in the last 75 years will give off distinctive gamma rays from cesium-137, whereas none before that date will. Plus, the level\n of activity can be used to estimate the vintage, at least between 1952 and 1980. A similar technique can be used to detect art forgeries because old paint contains no radioactive cesium or strontium. You can even use strontium-90 to determine the age of\n a skeleton, how long ago that person died, given it's in the past 75 years or so. This technique has been employed in dozens of forensic cases, where there previously was no reliable method of estimating the year of death if it was within the last 50 years.\n This method works because while we're alive, we are ingesting strontium-90, something that stops when we die. To this day, we all have some strontium-90 in our bones, albeit at lower levels. It's been about two half-lives since the peak of radioactivity.\n contamination, so three quarters of it have decayed and the rest has dispersed throughout the environment. So these days it's no longer much of a health concern. Still, it is there, inside every one of us, a signal that can't be covered up or faded.\n we are of this modern age. In your bones are the literal atomic fragments of atomic bombs that exploded decades ago. Hey, this\n This part of the video was sponsored by HBO Max and their new show Raised by Wolves.

            "transcription": "In 2011, an article was published in the reputable Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. It was called, Feeling the Future, Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Effect.\n In other words, proof that people can see into the future. The paper reported on nine experiments. In one, participants were shown two curtains on a computer screen and asked to predict which one had an image behind it. The other just covered a blank wall. Once the participant made their selection,\n the computer randomly positioned an image behind one of the curtains. Then the selected curtain was pulled back to show either the image or the blank wall. The images were randomly selected from one of three categories, neutral, negative, or erotic. If participants selected\n the curtain covering the image this was considered a hit. Now with there being two curtains and the images positioned randomly behind one of them you would expect the hit rate to be about 50% and that is exactly what the researchers found. At least for negative\n neutral images. However, for erotic images the hit rate was 53%. Does that mean that we can see into the future? Is that slight deviation significant? Well to assess significance scientists usually turn to p-values, a statistic that tells you how likely it results at\n least this extreme is if the null hypothesis is true. In this case the null hypothesis would just be that people couldn't actually see into the future and the 53% result was due to lucky guesses. For this study the p-value was 0.01 meaning there was just a 1% chance of getting\n a hit rate of 53% or higher from simple luck. P-values less than 0.05 are generally considered significant and worthy of publication. But you might want to use a higher bar before you accept that humans can accurately perceive the future and, say, invite the study's author on\n your news program. But hey, it's your choice. After all, the .05 threshold was arbitrarily selected by Ronald Fisher in a book he published in 1925. But this raises the question, how much of the published research literature is actually\n false. The intuitive answer seems to be 5%. I mean if everyone's using p less than 0.05 as a cutoff for statistical significance, you would expect 5 of every 100 results to be false positives. But that, unfortunately, grossly underestimates the problem.\n And here's why. Imagine you're a researcher in a field where there are a thousand hypotheses currently being investigated. Let's assume that 10% of them reflect true relationships and the rest are false. But no one, of course, knows which are which. That's the whole point of doing the research.\n Now, assuming the experiments are pretty well designed, they should correctly identify around, say, 80 of the 100 true relationships. This is known as a statistical power of 80%. So 20 results are false negatives. Perhaps the sample size was too small or\n the measurements were not sensitive enough. Now consider that from those 900 false hypotheses using a p-value of 0.05, 45 false hypotheses will be incorrectly considered true. As for the rest, they will be correctly identified as false, but\n But most journals rarely publish null results. They make up just 10 to 30 percent of papers depending on the field. Which means that the papers that eventually get published will include 80 true positive results, 45 false positive results, and maybe 20 true negative results.\n Nearly a third of published results will be wrong even with the system working normally. Things get even worse if studies are underpowered, an analysis shows they typically are, if there is a higher ratio of false to true hypotheses being tested,\n or if the researchers are biased. All of this was pointed out in a 2005 paper entitled, Why Most Published Research is False. So recently, researchers in a number of fields have attempted to quantify the problem by replicating some prominent past results.\n The reducibility project repeated 100 psychology studies but found only 36% had a statistically significant result the second time around. And the strength of measured relationships were on average half those of the original studies. An attempted verification of 53 studies considered\n in the basic science of cancer only managed to reproduce six, even working closely with the original study's authors. These results are even worse than I just calculated. The reason for this is nicely illustrated by a 2015 study showing that eating a bar of\n chocolate every day can help you lose weight faster. In this case the participants were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups. One went on a low-carb diet, another went on the same low-carb diet plus a 1.5 ounce bar of chocolate per day, and the third group was the control.\n instructed just to maintain their regular eating habits. At the end of three weeks the control group had neither lost nor gained weight but both low carb groups had lost an average of five pounds per person. The group that ate chocolate however lost weight 10% faster than the non-chocolate\n The finding was statistically significant with a p-value less than 0.05. As you might expect, this news spread like wildfire. To the front page of Build, the most widely circulated daily newspaper in Europe, and then to the Daily Star, the Irish Examiner, the Huffington Post,\n and post and even Shape magazine. Unfortunately the whole thing had been faked. Kind of. I mean researchers did perform the experiment exactly as they described but they intentionally designed it to increase the likelihood of false positives. The sample\n size was incredibly small, just five people per treatment group, and for each person 18 different measurements were tracked, including weight, cholesterol, sodium, blood protein levels, sleep quality, well-being, and so on. So if weight loss didn't show a\n significant difference there were plenty of other factors that might have. So the headline could have been chocolate lowers cholesterol or increases sleep quality or something. The point is a p-value is only really valid for a single measure. Once you're comparing a whole slew of variables the\n probability that at least one of them gives you a false positive goes way up. And this is known as p-hacking. Researchers can make a lot of decisions about their analysis that can decrease the p-value. For example, let's say you analyze your data and you find it nearly reaches statistical\n So you decide to collect just a few more data points to be sure. Then if the p-value drops below 0.05, you stop collecting data, confident that these additional data points could only have made the result more significant if there were really a true relationship there. But numerical simulations\n In fact, there are a great number of ways to increase the likelihood of significant results, like having two dependent\n variables, adding more observations, controlling for gender, or dropping one of three conditions. Combining all three of these strategies together increases the likelihood of a false positive to over 60 percent, and that is using p less than 0.05.\n Now if you think this is just a problem for psychology, neuroscience, or medicine, consider the pentaquark, an exotic particle made up of five quarks as opposed to the regular three for protons or neutrons. Particle physics employs particularly stringent requirements for studying\n statistical significance, referred to as 5 sigma, or one chance in 3.5 million of getting a false positive. But in 2002, a Japanese experiment found evidence for the theta plus pentaquark, and in the two years that followed, 11 other independent experiments then looked for\n and found evidence of that same pentacork with very high levels of statistical significance. From July 2003 to May 2004, a theoretical paper on pentacorks was published on average every other day. But alas, it was a false discovery.\n Further experimental attempts to confirm that theta plus pentaquark using greater statistical power failed to find any trace of its existence. The problem was those first scientists weren't blind to the data. They knew how the numbers were generated and what answer they expected to get.\n and the way the data was cut and analyzed or p-hacked produced the false finding. Now most scientists aren't p-hacking maliciously. There are legitimate decisions to be made about how to collect, analyze, and report data and these decisions impact on the statistical significance of\n results. For example, 29 different research groups were given the same data and asked to determine if dark skin soccer players are more likely to be given red cards. Using identical data, some groups found there was no significant effect while others concluded dark skin players were three\n times as likely to receive a red card. The point is that data doesn't speak for itself. It must be interpreted. Looking at those results, it seems that dark skin players are more likely to get red carded, but certainly not three times as likely. Consensus helps\n in this case, but for most results only one research group provides the analysis and therein lies the problem of incentives. Scientists have huge incentives to publish papers. In fact, their careers depend on it. As one scientist Brian Nocek puts it,\n is no cost to getting things wrong. The cost is not getting them published. Journals are far more likely to publish results that reach statistical significance. So if a method of data analysis results in a p-value less than .05, then you're likely to go with that method.\n It's also more likely if the result is novel and unexpected. This encourages researchers to investigate more and more unlikely hypotheses, which further decreases the ratio of true to spurious relationships that are tested. Now what about replication? Isn't science meant to self-correct?\n by having other scientists replicate the findings of an initial discovery? In theory, yes, but in practice it's more complicated. Like take the precognition study from the start of this video. Three researchers attempted to replicate one of those experiments and what did they find? Well, surprisingly,\n By surprise, the hit rate they obtained was not significantly different from chance. When they tried to publish their findings in the same journal as the original paper, they were rejected. The reason? The journal refuses to publish replication studies. So if you're a scientist, the\n Successful strategy is clear. Don't even attempt replication studies because few journals will publish them. And there is a very good chance that your results won't be statistically significant anyway. In which case, instead of being able to convince colleagues of the lack of reproducibility of an\n effect, you will be accused of just not doing it right. So a far better approach is to test novel and unexpected hypotheses and then p-hack your way to a statistically significant result. Now I don't want to be too cynical about this because over the\n past 10 years things have started changing for the better. Many scientists acknowledge the problems I've outlined and are starting to take steps to correct them. There are more large-scale replication studies undertaken in the last 10 years, plus there's a site Retraction Watch dedicated to publicizing\n papers that have been withdrawn. There are online repositories for unpublished negative results and there is a move towards submitting hypotheses and methods for peer review before conducting experiments with the guarantee that research will be published regardless of results so long\n as the procedure is followed. This eliminates publication bias, promotes higher-powered studies, and lessens the incentive for p-hacking. The thing I find most striking about the reproducibility crisis in science is not the prevalence of incorrect information in\n published scientific journals. After all, getting to the truth we know is hard, and mathematically not everything that is published can be correct. What gets me is the thought that even trying our best to figure out what's true, using our most sophisticated and rigorous mathematical tools\n peer review and the standards of practice we still get it wrong so often. So how frequently do we delude ourselves when we're not using the scientific method? As flawed as our science may be, it is far and away more reliable than\n And any other way of knowing\n with hundreds of thousands of titles in all areas of literature including fiction, nonfiction and periodicals.

Why are they selling it and why is it so expensive?\n Does it ever feel like you're living inside a sci-fi story or something? I've been here for a long time so I don't think it from that perspective but I should say yes. The science fiction element to me is like there's so much\n There are apple leaves and peach leaves, oyster tissue, bars of zinc metal, carbon dioxide in nitrogen.\n These vats of liquid nitrogen, there are samples of marine animals. Muscle samples, dolphin samples, whale samples, birds as well, bird tissue, and some human tissue as well.\n the weirdest thing they sell is something really mundane. Peanut butter. It looks like a peanut butter. It is peanut butter. It's creamy. It's probably the most expensive jar of peanut butter in the whole world. We essentially pay for\n company to make generic peanut butter. We might have 2,000 jars of generic peanut butter and what we do is we then go through and measure the fats in these jars and figure out how much of various compounds are in there and we actually then slap on a label and provide a certificate.\n Have you ever eaten some of this peanut butter? All of these things are not for human consumption because I don't know if I could actually tell you how old it is, but it's old enough that you probably don't want to eat it. How much does it cost? These are not sold at commercial grade prices.\n An ordinary jar of peanut butter costs less than $5.\n And on the label, you can see the ingredients and the amounts of different nutrients like protein, fats, sugar, and sodium. Those values have been measured by the manufacturer using different machines and analytical techniques. But how do you know those results are accurate?\n Well, this is where the government's standard jar of peanut butter comes in. It is mixed up so carefully and thoroughly that each jar contains exactly the same substance. We take great pains at homogenizing these things to make sure it's consistent.\n Then, scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, take years to painstakingly identify the quantities of all the different compounds in the peanut butter, with specified uncertainties. This peanut butter is then\n known as a standard reference material, or SRM. They sell these perfectly characterized SRM samples of peanut butter to researchers and manufacturers so they can calibrate their equipment. Essentially, the buyer knows that their\n equipment is working properly if, when they run the standard peanut butter, they get the values NIST supplies on the certificate.\n So what you're paying for is not really the peanut butter. It's the knowledge of exactly what is in the peanut butter.\n is our ability to assert the truth. We produce what I call truth in a bottle. You might think, why does it matter that the label on my peanut butter is accurate? But it is way more than the things on the label that NIST measures. Peanut butter actually\n contains naturally occurring aflatoxins, a carcinogen which can cause liver cancer, and they're produced by fungi on the peanuts. So if your peanut butter is made from a bad batch of peanuts, you want the factory to be able to accurately\n The FDA sample peanut butters and\n There are\n There are different challenges to measuring the components of different foods. Fine powder, for example, is easier to characterize than goopy peanut butter. So it's helpful to have a standard material that closely matches the target in composition and consistency.\n But it's also impossible for NIST to characterize every different type of food.\n fish you can usually use it as a surrogate. So you have a standard trout? Correct, yes. Tell me about meat homogenate. It is a mixed meat product that has been mixed thoroughly, been ground into a very fine particle and packed into a\n very nice tint. Why do you mix like chicken and pork? Why not just have like a chicken reference, a pork reference? We never do this by ourselves. We always work with these industry companies and say, hey, what kind of mixes do you need? And then we request that kind of material to be blended.\n For a reference material to be useful, it doesn't have to be the exact material a manufacturer wants to characterize, it just has to be close enough. NIST sells around 30 different food items that are spread around their food triangle.\n At the corners of the triangle are 100% carbohydrate, 100% fat, and 100% protein. So based on their mix of these three macro ingredients, all foods fall somewhere on this triangle, and to characterize each one, you would want to use the closest\n standard reference material.\n something, a matrix that looks as much as possible as what they're used to dealing with. They even have a standard diet mix. This is called typical diet. Through surveys, they identified what the average American eats and they purchased it all.\n And they blended it all up and then they freeze dried it into a nice fine powder. It's like a light gray powder and this represents all the nutritional components that an average American would consume. So it represents the sugar content, it represents the protein.\n In total, NIST has nearly 1,300 standard reference materials.\n warehouse and so it's approximately 20,000 square foot warehouse in which we store all of our inventory our products the SRM's and so we are a business and so what excites me about this being on the technical side is that I get to run a 20 million dollar business\n within the federal government.

In the early 1900s, like 1905, there was a huge issue with the quality of steel that was being used in rail cars, both locomotives\n in on the tracks. It was that they knew what they had to have in the alloys to make it work. It's just that all the foundries that were making them had no way to compare their results of the material they were making to what all the chemists knew they should be making. And so Congress basically\n said to National Bureau of Standards at the time, we need you to come up with standard samples of SEALs so that everyone can be on the same page. And so what we did was we made these standards deals, analyzed them for all their constituent parts, so all the elements, the chrome, the iron,\n iron, hydrogen, carbon, and then distributed that to the stakeholders, again the foundries, so that they can inter-compare and compare their results to a known source of steel. And those were our very first products that we produced.\n Steel is still one of the most important SRMs at NIST.\n stronger steel is. What Professor Charpy, Mr. Charpy came up with was a test where he set up a pendulum and at the end of a pendulum is a weight and if you pull that pendulum up to a certain distance you can calculate its potential energy.\n At the bottom of the swing of this pendulum, the arc, is a vise. And in the vise is held a standard piece of metal called a charpy. And this has a little V-notch in it.\n So the idea is that the pendulum comes through and breaks this thing and then it goes up on the other side and from that you can then calculate the amount of energy that it took to break this piece of steel. Every company in the United States and frankly internationally now has to check\n their materials against our Sharpies annually because the kind of steels they're making are used in pipelines or they're used in defense industries, you know, for tanks, for things that store nuclear waste. So I have a joke. I love things that break or burn and these things break and they have\n to break and they can't reuse them so we sell a lot. How many would you sell in a year? We sell of those of all the different kinds we sell about 8,000. Wow. Yeah. NIST has been making these standard reference materials for over a century.\n This is what our very first standard sample number one looks like. It is the real deal. And it's gray powder. It's limestone. We are still making limestone number one for 110 years. And it is still so popular.\n Most of the SRMs we've discussed so far are used for calibration, but there's another\n class of SRMs used for validation. This means they're used directly in industry tests to ensure consistency. An example is cigarettes. Evidently, smoking in bed was a real issue. You know, people were like catching on fire. And so there\n There was a lot of regulation as to how materials in your mattress or in your sheets or your bed clothes should react to a combustible source. And we produced some standard cigarettes that essentially, along with\n And for those tests to be consistent, the fires must be started with a standardized NIST cigarette.\n Fires started by smoking materials are the leading cause of death by fire in the home in the US. Products like this, but also with the regulations that were in place and just the educational campaigns that went on have saved many, many lives.\n But they also have standards for things you would never expect, like a standard bullet. Forensic labs then have to measure these\n grooves to match the bullet from the crime scene to others fired by the suspected weapon. But how do you know they are accurately measuring the grooves?\n indentations on it, so very, very fine marks, and it mapped it on this bullet. They weren't fired through a gun, they were manufactured. So to validate their equipment, Forensic Labs can run the standard bullet at the same time as a bullet from a crime scene, so they know their measurements are accurate.\n The goal of every standard is to quantify something about the world, something important that's usually pretty hard to measure. Like house dust. In the early 90s, we worked with\n made services and we got vacuum bags. We went to hotels, went to motels, took all the vacuum bags that we got from all these hotels and houses and everything, mixed it together in a big pot so it's fully mixed so every little jar has the same number of chemicals.\n Identifying dangerous contaminants is a\n But that's not a big part of what these standard reference materials are for, which is why they have several types of lead paint, or water from a glacier in Greenland.

            "transcription": "Do you bring this trick out at parties? Oh no, it's a terrible party trick. Here we go. 3.14159265358979323... This is Grant Guzman. He watched an old video of mine about how we think that there are two\n systems of thought. System two is the conscious, slow, effortful system and system one is subconscious, fast and automatic. To explore how these systems work in his own head, Grant decided to memorize a hundred digits of pi.\n Then he just kept going. He has now memorized 23,000 digits of Pi in preparation to challenge the North American record.\n That's amazing! I have wanted to make a video about experts for a long time. This is Magnus Carlsen, the five-time world chess champion.\n He's being shown chess boards and asked to identify the game in which they occurred. This looks an awful lot like Tal Botvinnik. Whoops.\n This is the 24th game from Seville obviously. Now I'm going to play through an opening and stop me when you recognise the game and if you can tell me who was playing black in this one. Okay.\n I'm sure you've seen this opening before. Against the butter. How can he do this? It seems like superhuman ability.\n So decades ago, scientists wanted to know what makes experts like chess masters special. Do they have incredibly high IQs? Much better spatial reasoning than average? Bigger short-term memory spans? Well, it turns out that as a group, chess masters are not exceptional.\n exceptional on any of these measures. But one experiment showed how their performance was vastly superior to amateurs. In 1973, William Chase and Herbert Simon recruited three chess players, a master, an A player, who's\n advanced amateur and a beginner. A chessboard was set up with around 25 pieces positioned as they might be during a game, and each player was allowed to look at the board for 5 seconds. Then they were asked to replicate the setup from memory on a second board in\n front of them. The players could take as many 5 second peeks as they needed to get their board to match. From just the first look, the master could recall the positions of 16 pieces, the A player could recall 8, and the beginner only 4.\n The master only needed half the number of peaks as the A player to get their board perfect. But then the researchers arranged the board with pieces in random positions that would never arise in a real game. And now the chess master performed no better than expected.\n than the beginner. After the first look, all players, regardless of rank, could remember the location of only three pieces. The data are clear. Chess experts don't have better memory in general, but they have better memory specifically for chess positions that could occur in a\n The implication is, what makes chess masters special, is that they have seen lots and lots of chess games. And over that time, their brains have learned patterns. So rather than seeing individual pieces at individual positions, they see a smaller number of rectangles.\n recognizable configurations. This is called chunking. What we have stored in long-term memory allows us to recognize complex stimuli as just one thing. For example, you recognize this as pi rather than a string of six unrelated numbers.\n or meaningless squiggles for that matter.\n At its core, expertise is about recognition. Magnus Carlsen recognizes chest positions the same way we recognize faces. And recognition leads directly to intuition. If you see an\n angry face, you have a pretty good idea of what's gonna come next. Chess masters recognize board positions and instinctively know the best move. Most of the time I know what to do. I don't have to\n To develop the long-term memory of an expert takes a long time. 10,000 hours is the rule of thumb popularized by Malcolm Gladwell, but 10,000 hours of practice by itself is not sufficient.\n There are four additional criteria that must be met. And in areas where these criteria aren't met, it's impossible to become an expert. So the first one is many repeated attempts with feedback. Tennis players hit hundreds of foreheads\n hands in practice. Chess players play thousands of games before their grandmasters, and physicists solve thousands of physics problems. Each one gets feedback. The tennis player sees whether each shot clears the net and is in or out. The chess player either\n wins or loses the game, and the physicist gets the problem right or wrong. But some professionals don't get repeated experience with the same sorts of problems. Political scientist Philip Tetlock picked 284 people who make their living commenting or\n offering advice on political and economic trends. This included journalists, foreign policy specialists, economists, and intelligence analysts. Over two decades, he peppered them with questions like, would George Bush be re-elected? Would apartheid in South Africa end peacefully?\n Would Quebec secede from Canada? And would the dot-com bubble burst? In each case, the pundits rated the probability of several possible outcomes, and by the end of the study, Tetlock had quantified 82,361 predictions.\n So, how did they do? Pretty terribly. These experts, most of whom had postgraduate degrees, performed worse than if they had just assigned equal probabilities to all the outcomes. In other words, people who spend their time and earn their\n living studying a particular topic produced poorer predictions than random chance. Even in the areas they knew best, experts were not significantly better than non-specialists. The problem is most of the events they have to predict are one-offs. They haven't had the experience\n of going through these events or very similar ones many times before. Even presidential elections only happen infrequently and each one in a slightly different environment. So we should be wary of experts who don't have repeated experience with feedback.\n The next requirement is a valid environment, one that contains regularities that make it at least somewhat predictable. A gambler betting at the roulette wheel, for example, may have thousands of repeated experiences with the same event, and for each one they get\n clear feedback in the form of whether they win or lose. But you would rightfully not consider them an expert because the environment is low validity. A roulette wheel is essentially random so there are no regularities to be learned. In 2006\n legendary investor Warren Buffett offered to bet a million dollars that he could pick an investment that would outperform Wall Street's best hedge funds over a 10-year period. Hedge funds are pools of money that are actively managed by some of the brightest and most experienced traders on Wall Street.\n They use advanced techniques like short selling, leverage and derivatives in an attempt to provide outsized returns and consequently they charge significant fees. One person took Buffett up on the bet, Ted Cides of Protege Partners. For his investment, he\n He selected five hedge funds, well actually five funds of hedge funds, so in total a collection of over 200 individual funds. Warren Buffett took a very different approach. He picked the most basic, boring investment imaginable.\n index fund that just tracks the weighted value of the 500 biggest public companies in America, the S&P 500. They started the bet on January 1st 2008 and immediately things did not look good for Buffett. It was the start of the global financial crisis\n and the market tanked. But the hedge funds could change their holdings and even profit from market falls. So they lost some value but not as much as the market average. The hedge funds stayed ahead for the next three years but by 2011 the S&P 500 had\n pulled even. And from then on, it wasn't even close. The market average surged, leaving the hedge funds in the dust. After 10 years, Buffett's index fund gained 125.8% to the hedge fund's 36%. Now, the market\n performance was not unusual over this time. At 8.5% annual growth, it nearly matches the stock market's long-run average. So why did so many investment professionals with years of industry experience, research at their fingertips, and big financial incentives to perform\n fail to beat the market? Well, because stocks are a low-validity environment. Over the short term, stock price movements are almost entirely random. So the feedback, although clear and immediate, doesn't actually reflect anything about the quality of the decision-making.\n It's closer to a roulette wheel than to chess. Over a 10-year period, around 80% of all actively managed investment funds fail to beat the market average. And if you look at longer time periods, underperformance rises to 90%.\n And before you say, well, that means 10% of managers have actual skill, consider that just through random chance, some people would beat the market anyway. Portfolios picked by cats or throwing darts have been shown to do just that. And in addition to luck, there are nefarious\n practices from insider trading to pump and dump schemes. Now I don't mean to say there are no expert investors, I mean Warren Buffett himself is a clear example, but the vast majority of stock pickers and active investment managers do not demonstrate expert performance.\n because of the low validity of their environment. Brief side note, if we know that stock picking will usually yield worse results over the long term and that what active managers charge in fees is rarely compensated for in improved performance, then why\n Why is so much money invested in individual stocks, mutual funds, and hedge funds? Well, let me answer that with a story. There was an experiment carried out with rats and humans, where there's a red button and a green button that can each light up.\n the green button lights up and 20% of the time the red button lights up, but randomly. So you can never be sure which button will light. And the task for the subject, either rat or human, is to guess beforehand which button will light up by pressing it. For the\n If they guess right, they get a bit of food, and if they guess wrong, a mild electric shock. The rat quickly learns to press only the green button and accept the 80% win percentage. Humans, on the other hand, usually press the green button, but once in a while,\n they try to predict when the red light will go on. And as a result, they guess right only 68% of the time. We have a hard time accepting average results and we see patterns everywhere, including in randomness. So we try to beat the average by predicting the pattern.\n But when there is no pattern, this is a terrible strategy. Even when there are patterns, you need timely feedback in order to learn them. And YouTube knows this, which is why within the first hour after posting a video, they tell you how its performance compares to your last\n 10 videos. There's even confetti fireworks when the video is number one. I know it seems like a silly thing, but you have no idea how powerful a reward this is and how much YouTuber effort is spent chasing this supercharged dopamine hit. To understand\n the difference between immediate and delayed feedback, psychologist Daniel Kahneman contrasts the experiences of anesthesiologists and radiologists. Anesthesiologists work alongside the patient and get feedback straight away. Is the patient unconscious with stable vital signs?\n With this immediate feedback, it's easier for them to learn the regularities of their environment. Radiologists, on the other hand, don't get rapid feedback on their diagnoses if they get it at all. This makes it much harder for them to improve. Radiologists typically correctly diagnose\n breast cancer from x-rays just 70% of the time. Delayed feedback also seems to be a problem for college admissions officers and recruitment specialists. After admitting someone to college or hiring someone at a big company, you may never or only much later find out\n how they did. This makes it harder to recognize the patterns in ideal candidates. In one study, Richard Melton tried to predict the grades of freshmen at the end of their first year of college. A set of 14 counselors interviewed each student for 45 minutes to an hour.\n They also had access to high school grades, several aptitude tests, and a four-page personal statement. For comparison, Melton created an algorithm that used as input only a fraction of the information, just high school grades and one aptitude test.\n Nevertheless, the formula was more accurate than 11 of the 14 counselors. Melton's study was reported alongside over a dozen similar results across a variety of other domains, from predicting who would violate parole to who'd succeed in pilot training.\n If you've ever been denied admission to an educational institution or turned down for a job, it feels like an expert has considered your potential and decided that you don't have what it takes to succeed. You know, I was rejected twice from film school and twice from a drama program, so it's comforting to know\n know that the gatekeepers at these institutions aren't great predictors of future success. So if you're in a valid environment and you get repeated experience with the same events, with clear timely feedback for each attempt, will you definitely become an expert in 10,000 hours or so?\n The answer, unfortunately, is no. Because most of us want to be comfortable. For a lot of tasks in life, we can become competent in a fairly short period of time. Take driving a car, for example. Initially, it's pretty challenging, it takes up all of system 2, but after\n After 50 hours or so, it becomes automatic. System 1 takes over and you can do it without much conscious thought. After that, more time spent driving doesn't improve performance. If you wanted to keep improving, you would have to try driving in challenging situations like new terrain, higher\n speeds or in difficult weather. I have played guitar for 25 years, but I'm not an expert because I usually play the same songs. It's easier and more fun. But in order to learn, you have to be practicing at the edge of your ability, pushing beyond your comfort zone. You have\n use a lot of concentration and methodically repeatedly attempt things you aren't good at.\n and know exactly where you are and what your fingers are doing and what it feels like. This is known as deliberate practice and in many areas professionals don't engage in deliberate practice so their performance doesn't improve. In fact sometimes it declines. If you're experiencing chest pain\n and you walk into a hospital, would you rather the doctor is a recent graduate or someone with 20 years experience? Researchers have found that diagnostic skills of medical students increase with their time in medical school, which makes sense. The more cases you've seen with feedback, the better you are at spotting\n patterns, but this only works up to a point. When it comes to rare diseases of the heart or lungs, doctors with 20 years experience were actually worse at diagnosing them than recent graduates. And that's because they haven't thought about those rare diseases in a long time, so they're less able to recognize\n And you can see the same effect in chess. The best predictor of skill level is not the number of games or tournaments played, but the number of hours dedicated to serious\n solitary study. Players spend thousands of hours alone learning chess theory, studying their own games and those of others, and they play through compositions, which are puzzles designed to help you recognize tactical patterns. In chess, as in other areas, it can be challenging to force\n yourself to practice deliberately. And this is why coaches and teachers are so valuable. They can recognize your weaknesses and assign tasks to address them. To become an expert, you have to practice for thousands of hours in the uncomfortable zone, attempting the things you\n can't do quite yet. True expertise is amazing to watch. To me, it looks like magic, but it isn't. At its core, expertise is recognition, and recognition comes from the incredible amount of highly structured information stored in long-term\n memory. To build that memory requires four things, a valid environment, many repetitions, timely feedback, and thousands of hours of deliberate practice. When those criteria are met, human performance is astonishing. And when it's not,\n you get people we think of as experts who actually aren't. If you want to become a STEM expert, you have to actively interact with problems. That's what you can do with\n Brilliant, the sponsor of this video.

            "transcription": "I am going to turn myself into an optical illusion by going through this window right here. Okay, I'm good. Not good. I was gonna say I'm good.\n I'm not good. Okay, so you're looking at this window and it looks like it's turning around except here it stops. Now I keep rotating but the window is rotating through me. What is happening? This video is sponsored by NordVPN. They help\n create the illusion that you could be anywhere in the world. Let me back up for a second. This is the first part of a three-part illusion. What do you see? Well, there's a window and it's turning.\n except it stops and reverses direction. So the window is oscillating back and forth. That's what most people see when they look at this illusion, except that's not what the window is actually doing.\n It's on this turntable and it is rotating continuously. This is known as the Ames window illusion and I saw it on an old Australian TV program called the Curiosity Show and I was curious. So in this video I'm going\n going to dig deeper into this illusion than anyone has before. You know, the window itself is not a rectangle but a trapezoid. You can see this side here is much shorter than this side over here, and that\n is essential to the illusion. Also essential, it is shaded to make it look 3D, but it's actually just a two-dimensional card with the same image on both sides. So now that you know exactly what this object looks like and what it's doing, can you correctly\n perceive the rotation rather than the oscillation? I still can't. It still looks to my brain like this window is going back and forth. Okay, here's an idea. I'm going\n to attach this Rubik's Cube to the short side of the trapezoid so we can keep track of it as it goes around. You ready? Okay.\n Okay, the Rubik's Cube is going around. Everything seems normal. But now what is that? It looks like the Rubik's Cube is continuing to go around.\n around, but the window is oscillating back and forth. There goes the Rubik's Cube around the back. I don't even know what's happening. Whoa! Look at that!\n Looks like the Rubik's Cube is out drifting by itself out in front of the whole illusion. What is happening? Okay, new plan. I'm going to take off the Rubik's Cube and I'm going to put a ruler right through the\n the middle of the window and so we can't possibly be fooled by the illusion, right? Okay, here we go. Okay, the ruler is rotating around, but wait, now\n the window is going backwards, whoa! Whoa! The ruler is going through the window! It is doing things which I know are physically impossible, but that is how my brain is seeing it. Look, here we go again.\n And the ruler is turning around with the window, but right about here the window starts going backwards, but the ruler keeps coming. What is even... like how is this possible? This doesn't make any sense.\n But that is the way my brain interprets this. It clearly prefers the illusion over seeing what's really happening, the continuous rotation. So why is this? How does the illusion work? Well, it was created by Adelbert\n Ames back in 1947 and before becoming a researcher he wanted to be a visual artist so he was fascinated by how people perceive shapes and shading and according to him the key to this illusion is that we're all\n used to living in rectangular boxes essentially. You know, houses and rooms where virtually all of the corners we see are 90 degree angles. Doors, windows, tables and chairs are full of 90 degree angles.\n This is called the Carpentered Environment. But unless we're looking straight on at something, the angles we actually see are not 90 degrees. I mean the images that form on our retinas are typically trapezoids of different shapes and sizes.\n and sizes. Now from extensive experience, our brains know they really should be rectangles and right angles. So our brains use these strange shapes to infer depth information, which in our rectilinear world is almost always correct.\n but not in the case of a trapezoidal window that our brains assume to be rectangular, hence the illusion. Now if this carpentered world hypothesis is correct, well then you'd expect people with less experience of rectangles in their environments to be\n less susceptible to the illusion. And to test exactly this, in 1957 Harvard psychologists tried the Ames window illusion in South Africa, with 80 children aged 10 to 14. 40 of them were living in the city of Durban, full\n of rectangular buildings, doors, and windows. The other 40 were from nearby rural communities where they lived in round huts with few prominent 90 degree angles. When subjects were seated 10 feet away from the rotating Aims window,\n with both eyes open, 60% of the urban group reported seeing the window oscillating, but in the rural group, only 17.5% saw the same thing. So the results were consistent with the Carpentered World Hypothesis.\n The kids with less experience of rectangles were less likely to fall for the illusion. But that's not the whole story. When seated 20 feet away and with one eye closed, the illusion was much more convincing. Now 90% of all participants\n saw the window oscillating and there was no significant difference between urban and rural groups. That means something else must be going on over and above our experience with rectangles. In fact, you can get a similar illusion without any straight lines\n at all. This is the Deheer circle. When rotating continuously, it also appears to oscillate back and forth. So what's going on? Well, both of these illusions make use of a technique called anamorphosis, which has been used by artists\n for centuries, if not millennia. This is a painting from 1533 called The Ambassadors by Hans Holbein the Younger. It clearly shows two prominent figures, but there is also this\n distorted shape over the floor. Only when viewed from the correct position, either the top right or bottom left, does it become clear that the image is actually a detailed depiction of a human skull. It's suspected that the painting was meant to be hung in a\n stairwell, where presumably out of the corner of your eye, you would spot the striking image of the skull reminding you of your own mortality. But if you were to look at the painting head on, well, the skull would be pretty hard to see.\n This involves making a distorted projection of an object. So to see its proper proportions, you need to look at the work from a particular position or with a particular device, often a mirror. There are earlier examples, like Leonardo's Eye by Leonardo da Vinci.\n which only takes its proper form when viewed from the side. Clearly, Leonardo knew how to give side eye. And some might argue that the cave paintings at Lascaux, France from 17,000 years ago provide the first examples of anamorphic art.\n art. Due to the uneven painting surface, artists would have had to consider how their animal figures would be perceived from different vantage points.\n Amorphis is also central to perhaps Ames most famous illusion the Ames room Ames designed his first distortive room in 1934 and with one eye from one privileged perspective it just looks like an ordinary\n room, but when people move around the room, it becomes obvious that something is not quite right. An Aims room is constructed by taking an ordinary rectangular room and adding a\n a diagonal wall through the middle of it. Then draw lines connecting all the key parts of the room, like corners, windows, and so on, to the privileged viewpoint. Mark where those lines intersect the diagonal wall. Then, add a\n and a ceiling. If the projection is done properly, they will not only be tilted but also warped. Then connect the floor and ceiling with trapezoidal walls and voila, you have an Aims Room.\n Ames realized there are an infinite number of different distorted room geometries which when viewed from the privileged position create virtually identical\n So our perceptions, far from transparently representing external reality, are constantly faced with ambiguity. And our brains, below the level of consciousness, have to decide which\n of the infinite possibilities we're actually looking at. One form of ambiguity relates to depth perception. Which of these masks protrudes outwards towards the camera and which is an impression? Only through most\n motion, does it become obvious which is which? We are subconsciously attuned to visual cues that indicate how close or far away something is. Closer objects are typically bigger and brighter, plus they obscure objects behind them. But we can\n play with these attributes in order to create situations that defy our expectations. Now I have been obsessed with getting the Ames window illusion to work. Look at how many different\n Aims windows I have been making. And I made them small initially and then bigger. There used to be a disco ball in this room. I never thought that this would come in handy.\n Then I thought about the question, how could I make myself like the ruler that passes through the Ames window? And of course then I would need a very large Ames window. So it's been this holiday season\n season like we're living in a weird surreal art museum or something. It needed to be at least eight feet on its longest dimension. It's actually made out of six pieces of plywood glued screwed together.\n the challenges is to make it really thin because ideally it should just be two-dimensional. So we had to bevel these edges here. So then I would twist up these metal\n cables that hang it to the ceiling and then jump in the window and let them unwind. Okay so I'll show you some of the best shots I was able to get and you let me know does this work for you do you see it oscillating or do\n you just see it rotating as it actually is. I found lighting is really important. The lighting needs to be really even on both sides to convince you that it is really oscillating. When the\n When the large side of the trapezoid is close to us, we perceive it rotating exactly as it is. But when the large side moves around to the back, it is still larger in our field of view than the small side. So our brain perceives it as closer and rotating in the opposite direction.\n direction. This is why the window appears to oscillate. Half the time we're seeing the window as it is, and half the time we're seeing the bigger side as closer to us, even though it's farther away. But how do we develop the\n ability to interpret depth cues in the first place? Well, it seems to be an innate ability which forms very early in our development. They've actually shown babies in three different age groups, five and a half months, seven and a half months, and\n nine months the Ames window illusion. Do they see the window oscillating? And how would we know if they did? Well babies have a well-known preference for novelty. They look longer at things that are new to them. So experiment\n The printers first exposed them to an ordinary rotating circle, and then they showed them simultaneously the Ames window and a rotating rectangular window. The five and a half month old babies showed no special preference for the Ames window,\n and a half and nine-month-olds were significantly more interested in the Aims window, suggesting they perceive it as doing something different, presumably oscillating. The reason I have been so obsessed with this illusion\n conclusion is because I think it confronts one of the big misconceptions about science, which is this idea that scientists propose competing theories, and then all you have to do is look at the data to decide which is the best theory. The truth is,\n there are many circumstances in which the same data could come from very different external realities. To use a classic example, does the sun go around the earth or does the earth rotate on its axis? The observation of the sun\n moving across the sky doesn't in itself resolve that debate. Or to use more modern examples, when you make a quantum measurement, does the wave function collapse? Or does it branch the universe?\n speed of light really the same in all directions, or does it differ and only the round-trip speed is c? As of right now, the data do not discriminate between those theories. And I think we can extend this beyond\n science. Maybe the Ames illusions are a good metaphor for life. We feel as though we can directly perceive external reality, like a person looking into an Ames room, but the truth is there are an infinite number of different\n that would all look the same. You know these days a lot of people are getting basically the same fundamental information but coming to very different conclusions about the state of reality. So I think in that context it's important to remember that\n something as simple as a little rotating picture can fool our brains in fairly spectacular ways. So we should approach the world and our conclusions about it with a little more humility and a little less certainty.\n certainty.\n Earlier this year, I wanted to watch my favorite sports team in the playoffs, so I bought an all-access pass from the league. But then when I went to watch a game, there was a blackout restriction in my area. So I used NordVPN to set my location to Australia.\n and watch the game from there. In the past, I've made documentaries that were free to stream in the US or Australia, but basically impossible to access almost anywhere else. And VPNs offer the solution. They help you create the illusion\n that you are somewhere else. And with NordVPN, you get access to 5,000 servers in nearly 60 countries.

And this is something I take particular advantage of when joining\n public wifi, at cafes, or when I'm traveling.

            "transcription": "Can I tell you something I'm bad at? I am terrible at making clickbait. Up until two years ago, my most popular video was about a basketball being dropped from a dam with a bit of backspin. It takes off like a rocket and shoots out way further\n than you'd expect. This video was embedded on literally hundreds of news websites, and in its first week it got 16.3 million views, but almost none of those views came on the YouTube platform. Why?\n because I gave it this thumbnail and I called it Strange Applications of the Magnus Effect. This video is sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show. Now I believe within YouTube I'm used as an example of\n how not to package your video. As if to demonstrate just how bad a title and thumbnail this is, someone else re-uploaded the video with the clever title, Basketball Dropped From Dam. And within a few weeks, that video had received tens of millions of views on\n on YouTube. This is when YouTube gave me access to Content ID, the system that allows you to earn revenue when someone else reuploads your videos. Which was good, but I still wasn't very good at clickbait. So for this video, I called in an expert.\n I wanted to see your reaction face. Can you give me like a reaction face? Like what's a good thumbnail face? Oh, I got you. This is a thumbnail face. I have like 10 I go through the motions of like.\n When I started on this platform some 10 years ago, clickbait was less important. Subscribers were what mattered.\n because most of the views came from the sub feed and videos went viral usually by getting a lot of attention elsewhere like on reddit or Facebook not due to the YouTube algorithm but once you had a big video and people subscribed well then your next video would likely get a lot of views\n from those subscribers. So YouTube would take that popular video and share it with more people and so you'd get more subscribers in a positive feedback loop. But soon YouTube realized that this did not create the best experience for the viewer. They discovered that\n that showing people only videos from channels they were subscribed to led to fewer clicks, less watch time, and less engagement with the site as a whole. Plus, they knew that relying on other platforms to drive traffic to viral hits was risky, since those other platforms\n might disable the traffic at any time. So they needed to make YouTube a destination in itself. They wanted people to come to YouTube, see videos that interested them, click on at least one of them, and watch it for a while. Ideally get sucked down the YouTube rabbit hole\n whole\n importance of subscribers, make it less like a podcast app where you only get the shows you're subscribed to, and more like Reddit where stuff with the most engagement rises to the top. But that necessarily meant increasing the importance of clickbait.\n Now there seems to be a paradox when it comes to clickbait, people almost universally claim to hate it, but you also see it everywhere, so why is this? Well one of the problems is we don't all agree on the definition of clickbait, when a Google\n To call it, the top definition is, on the internet, content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular webpage. We could call this type one clickbait, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.\n If you didn't try to attract attention and get people to click on your links, then you wouldn't really be doing your job. But there is a second definition, one that I think more people ascribe to, which is something such as a headline designed to make readers want to click on a hyperlink,\n especially when the link leads to content of dubious value or interest. Wikipedia says a defining characteristic of clickbait is that it is sensationalized or misleading, and it also talks about teasers that intentionally withhold information to exploit the curiosity\n gap. They give you enough information to make you curious, but not enough to satisfy that curiosity. Here are two actual titles from a news website. 9 out of 10 Americans are completely wrong about this mind-blowing fact.\n and someone gave some kids some scissors, here's what happened next. I think we can all agree that these are examples of bad type 2 clickbait. Now imagine a clickbait space where on one axis you have how misleading or sensationalizing\n it is and on the other how much information is intentionally withheld to create a curiosity gap. Well then these two titles fall in the top right corner and these are the zones of type 2 clickbait. At the other extreme you have things that are so\n unsensationalized as to be dull. You could call this the dead zone. Now here is where you would find strange applications of the Magnus effect. I mean I didn't tell you what the applications were. Now in the middle is where\n where you would find type 1 clickbait. But honestly, I think type 1 and type 2 clickbait are so different that we shouldn't even use the same word for them. Instead of type 1 clickbait, my friend and YouTuber Brady Herron suggested legitbait. I mean,\n It might sound enticing, but it is legit. Instead of type 2 clickbait, we could use click trap, click trick, link trap, or dupe shoot. What's important to recognize is that for any given video, there is no\n One true title and thumbnail. Each video could have hundreds or thousands of different, legit bait titles. For example, how does a zero G plane work? I went on a plane that does parabolic trajectories. What happens to fire?\n on a zero-g plane. Now the most enticing titles and thumbnails are found close to type 2 clickbait. I'm reminded of the infographic by Smarter Every Day showing that on social media, the greatest engagement occurs close to the boundary of what's allowable.\n But remember that everyone's definition of clickbait is different and everyone's perceptions of words and images are different. So these are not clear boundaries, they're actually kind of fuzzy. What for one person might be a legit bait, for someone else could be a click trap.\n What's clear is that on a site where click-through rate is important clickbait of all types is inevitable How important to a video success is the title and thumbnail? Very important, of course, if they don't click on the video, they don't watch it. You can't get 10\n So why is clickbait everywhere? Well, because it works. More enticing thumbnails get more clicks,\n Despite some people's claims that they won't click or they'll unsub, it's just like evolution. Whatever survives multiplies and traits become amplified. If you don't begrudge the giraffe its long neck so it can reach the highest leaves, can you begrudge a YouTuber\n the big red arrow that allows them to reach further audiences? I talked about this in my video two years ago. To be successful as a YouTuber you need to optimize two things. Watch time and the click-through rate of your videos. That's the number of times the title and thumbnail are clicked divided\n it by the total number of times they're shown. At the time, this was something of a revelation for me, because I always thought my job was to make great videos, and then a title and thumbnail that adequately represented what the video was about. But now I've realized that\n that making the title and thumbnail is at least half the job. This is not just because better titles and thumbnails get you more clicks, but because better titles and thumbnails will get you way more impressions. YouTube has limited real estate with which\n to\n you more impressions. Now the big development since my last video on this is YouTube introduced real-time metrics like views impressions and click-through rate and I suggested this would create an arms race. So what you can bet will happen is that creators will\n launch a video and then they'll be sitting there with all these different variants of thumbnails and they'll be swapping them out and looking at what that does to click-through rate and then going with the one that leads to the greatest click-through rate. And this is basically what has happened.\n Let me give you my favorite example. Last year I made a video about asteroids, which I thought was really good. I called it, and people were very positive about the video. They thought it was made\n be one of my best. But the performance was well below average. In its first day, Asteroids was ranked 9th out of my previous 10 videos. It was probably on target for about 1.5 million views. So I tried different titles and\n thumbnails like asteroid impact what are our chances or asteroid impact what could we do but none of these changes got much traction and then on day three after lunch I changed the title and thumbnail to these are the asteroids to worry\n about. And immediately, the video started doing better. It quickly shot up from almost my worst performing video to my best. It now has 14 million views. Nothing about the video changed, just that one\n image and 38 characters. But because of that, the video has reached nearly 10 times as many people as it otherwise would have. And the title and thumbnail accurately describe what the video is about. Sure, there's a curiosity gap, but you couldn't explain\n the whole concept in the length of the title. So if you see a YouTuber changing titles and thumbnails, this is why. Because that effort can be rewarded many times over. I've seen people objecting to this practice because they think the creator is trying to dupe their audience,\n them to click on the same video more than once, but that's not it. The whole point is to get YouTube to show the title and thumbnail to more people. We're trying to increase the number of impressions, which is heavily dependent on the click-through rate. Now a lot of my recent videos\n have this typical view curve. There's an initial spike after I release the video and then a dip and then a second bump after I have figured out a better title and thumbnail. I changed the title and thumbnail and I watched the real-time view graph. What I'm looking for\n for\n knows exactly which thumbnail will work best beforehand.\n The thing is, you don't really know. I mean, you could know if you just were an almighty being that could just predict what people would be interested in. But us, you know, usually, like, if you do hide and seek, you don't really know if, like, you hiding in a tree and then someone walks you below\n use a good thumbnail or if you hiding a trash can in the parking front so you know just do both and then see which one interests people a little bit more I feel the same way but I do feel like you have a better sense of this than like most people of course no one gets 40 million views\n video. But what is the point in getting more views? If you're cynical you might say it's all about money and fame and while there are certainly financial incentives to getting more views that's not why I do it. As an educational\n As a YouTuber, I think there are two very good reasons for using excellent type 1 clickbait over more straightforward packaging. To understand the first reason, let's consider two different possible titles for my most recent video. I called it the simplest math problem no one\n can solve. But it's a video about the Kolat's conjecture, so perhaps a more straightforward title would have been simply to call it that. The problem is, if I publish a video called the Kolat's conjecture, the most likely people to click on it are those who already know\n know what the Collatz conjecture is, and the vast majority of people will never have heard of it. So for them, the title is meaningless, and only the very curious or those who really like Veritasium would click. In contrast, calling it the simplest math problem no one\n solve conveys more information about the video to everyone. This means more people can click on it, most of whom will never have heard of the call-outs conjecture, so I get to teach them something new. And since the video has a higher click-through rate, YouTube shows it to even\n more people, so if my aim is to increase the level of knowledge in the world by the maximum amount possible, this is the way to do it. The second reason we need to optimize titles and thumbnails is to support the major goal of this channel\n we are trying to make the best science films on every topic we tackle. That means traveling to meet experts and film experiments, hiring people to build props, make spectacular animations, research and fact check, we hire expert\n consultants to double and triple check our work. I don't want to make vlogs, I want to make science documentaries on YouTube that put broadcasts to shame. And to make this possible and sustainable, the videos have to get views, and lots of them. And to do that, we have to make\n the best titles and thumbnails we can. YouTuber and Patreon CEO Jack Conte has talked about adjusting your packaging. The idea is know what you're passionate about, what you won't compromise on, and that stuff goes in the box. All the rest, like would\n paper it's wrapped in, that's the packaging. So the video is my focus, and the title and thumbnail are the packaging that I'm happy to adjust so I can make the type of videos that are important to me. Now is it ironic that a channel whose whole purpose is to promote a truth-seeking mindset has to be\n experiment at the edge of what is truthful in order to fulfill that purpose, it is something that I often worry about. You know, when I did like risk in my life to do X, it's like, well, what probability of death does there have to be for you to risk your life? Like, 50%?\n and\n But what I realized is that I don't have to trust my instincts. This problem of getting the best\n title and thumbnail, it's a scientific problem. We're just asking which accurate representation of the video will get the most clicks from a general audience. And that's a problem we can use the scientific method to solve. So I've hired a couple of really bright people\n and we spend a lot of time brainstorming and making titles and thumbnails and testing them out, for example on Twitter and Patreon. Veritasium titles and thumbnails have gotten better not because I'm better at it, but because of my team and our testing. If you have ideas about how we\n could do it better, please get in touch. The results have often contradicted what I expected. This video seemed to perform 10% better when we excluded the word surprising from the title, so it became simply the secret of synchronization. I thought\n People thought these two titles were basically a toss-up, but Patreon had a strong preference for one over the other. What's interesting about this research is that the more clickable titles and thumbnails often better represent the content of the video. Let me give you some examples.\n One thing I didn't expect when YouTube brought in the real-time analytics tools and allowed title and thumbnail changes to affect impressions was that it would also work for older videos. So here is an old video that I originally entitled, Why the Neutron is the Hero of Nuclear Physics.\n In hindsight, it's a weird kind of meaningless title. So I changed it to why Einstein thought nuclear weapons impossible. It's clearer, more accurate, and this is what happened to views after the change.\n I changed strange applications of the Magnus effect to backspin basketball flies off dam. Again, more accurate and the video is now being watched on YouTube. Probably 10 million more views than it otherwise would have had.\n even anti-clickbait has proven effective. Here's a video I originally titled, are negative ions good for you? Which is a question nobody asked ever. Now I changed it to, do salt lamps work?\n Seriously, and here's the result. One and a half million more views. I think looking at these examples you could easily make the case that YouTube has made me better at what I do. It has improved\n the clarity and accuracy of my titles and thumbnails to help me figure out what is interesting to my audience and how to encapsulate that in a single image in fewer than 50 characters. For those of you who worry that a focus on titles and thumbnails will prevent me from picking challenging science\n topics? Well, I simply ask you to look at the videos from the last year or two, like the ones on Goodell's incompleteness theorem, general relativity, Penrose tilings, the logistic map, Newton's method of calculating pi, the one-way speed of light, good titles and thumbnails\n make it possible to tackle these topics and to reach more people who have never heard of them before. There is a symbiotic relationship between views and video quality. The more views we get, the more people, locations, props and equipment and research we\n can invest in. This makes the next video better than the last. If we can be good at titles and thumbnails, the ultimate outcome is better videos. That is something I think you and I both want.\n Hey, this video is sponsored by KiwiCo, a long time supporter of the channel. Now KiwiCo makes awesome hands-on projects for kids, including big kids like me. They have eight subscription lines targeted at different age groups all the way down\n to newborns. What I love about KiwiCo crates is that they make learning fun and something to look forward to. I mean, when I pull out a crate, my kids just jump at the chance to make it with me. And all the materials you need come right in the box, so there's no need to run to the store, you just open it up\n and go. My kids and I just built this domino machine which who knows might be inspiration for a viral video. Now the big idea is that while playing and having fun kids learn about STEAM concepts that is science, technology, engineering, art,\n and math and in addition to the project there's a magazine with a lot of additional information so I think this is the best way to learn by doing something yourself and having fun it's how education should be so if you want to try it out go to KiwiCo.com slash Veritasium50 and you'll\n you'll get 50% off your first month of any crate. I will put that link down in the description. So I wanna thank KiwiCo for sponsoring Veritasium and I wanna thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "Guess who just turned up at my place. It is Grant Thompson the king of random. What's up guys? Grant is actually gonna show me a little survival tip Let's say you're stuck out in the woods, and you need to make a fire But you don't have say matches or a lighter. We're gonna try to use a ziplock bag to\n start a fire. I guess when you're building a fire the first thing you're gonna need is some tinder so we're gonna have to go scoundrel around for some options. This stuff works pretty well and this is pretty dry. Yeah we definitely want something that's off the ground if possible because we need it as dry as possible. The first step was to grind up the tinder in\n into a fine powder. I'm just following Grant's instructions here. I'm not really sure if this is gonna work. See that right there? That's the stuff we're going for. It's super fine. We're gonna take our base plate. We're gonna pinch a nice little pile in there. Okay, so at this point we're pretty much ready to start\n the ignition process. So what do we need? For that we're gonna need a ziplock bag and a little bit of water. Now this is just a regular ziplock sandwich baggie. We're gonna pour that in until it's about halfway full. You let me know when. Grab water from a creek or stream or wherever you like. Now here's the trick, we want to\n develop this into some kind of a liquid sphere. We're going to be making a liquid magnifying glass. So I do that by turning my Ziploc bag, you know, 45 degrees so it creates this diamond shape. And then we're just going to gather these two corners together. We're going to lose a little bit of water as we do. And we're going to pinch that off. And the next goal is to\n twist it to trap all that water inside. You see as I twist it, it creates pressure that exerts almost an equal pressure on all sides. And now while it's not a perfect sphere, it will eventually start to bubble out into a nice liquid sphere where we need\n We've essentially just made a makeshift magnifying glass and you start the fire the same way you would with a magnifying glass. Now once you roll the ball around you can see where it looks the best. We're looking for as close to a sphere as possible, which is right there. Now if I back it out, you can see there it starts smoking immediately.\n That's incredible. The focal length of a lens is the place where all of the light converges. So that's really what we're trying to establish here, right, is position the Tinder pile at the focal point of this spherical, biconvex lens, essentially. Now you can see this has been smoking for a little while.\n We've developed a little bit of an ember base. It's burned a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, and so now I'm gonna sprinkle a little bit more fuel on top there And that will cause the heat to rise and burn that from the bottom and then I'm gonna hit it again from the top nice It's interesting how you're like kind of bringing it down\n down so that the surface of that is not actually where the most concentrated rays are, you're concentrating even deeper down into the pile. That's right, because we don't want the heat to dissipate too much, and if we're at an extreme focal point like this, the heat's going to bleed off, so if we can warm\n the surrounding area it actually helps speed the process. Right. We're just going to repeat that process until it will stay smoking on its own. We've only been at this for a minute or two and the amount of smoke we're seeing there is pretty significant. A little bit of sprinkle, a little bit of sunlight, rinse and repeat.\n Really elevating the temperature. Mm-hmm. At this point our pile is smoking pretty well on its own. Now I'm gonna go ahead and take this plastic bag and just set it to the side. We could reuse this again if we wanted to. At this point we can probably start adding smaller pieces of tinder.\n You'll get a few of these little pieces here. We're going to build that into a small... We want it to be extremely light, airy. Sure, to still allow the oxygen to get in there. Exactly. Because if you take away the oxygen, you smother the fire. Cool.\n We're going to let it sit for a couple minutes. While that's going, we can start chopping up some of these pieces we just found lying on the ground. They're dry, it's almost like straw. We're going to pull them into very thin fibers. We want to make something that resembles a bird's nest. Something that's light, airy, and can catch fire very quickly.\n transfer this without disturbing the coals as much as possible. The way that I like to do that is take this base, we're going to take this grass we're going to put over top and we're just going to gently roll it over like this. Oh wow. Now you can see all those hot coals transfer down into the grass and we're just going to\n cover it over to help conceal, block it from some of the wind, like this. And now because of all that straw, the air can flow through it and help build the heat. One trick that I use that looks a little bit funny, I just stick this in my hand and spin in circles.\n And it really works, honestly. That's impressive. You can already see it smoking a little bit more.\n We're going to give that a second just for the heat to build back up. Yeah, but you can totally see there's a lot more fuel catching on fire now. What we want to be seeing is thicker smoke and we want to see it progressing. If we see the smoke dying down or getting weaker, like slow down, get it out of the breeze, give it a chance for the heat to build.\n This is ready if you look down in there you can almost see glowing red embers now it wants to light it wants to light it just needs a little bit of a flick I'm just gonna build up a little more a little spinning trick. Oh you see that goes hot flame. That's amazing boom and then we wow here\n Oh, that didn't work. Shoot, sorry Derek. It's okay. We've clearly demonstrated forming a fire. Well that my friend is how to start a fire with a sandwich bag and bright side of the day. That's nicely done. I want to say a huge thank you to Graeme.\n Grant here, King of Random, you should go check out his channel. Does lots of very random things and has taught me a thing or two, that's for sure. A lot about survival hacks and a lot of those things that you really shouldn't try at home and we show you why you shouldn't try them at home. In fact, we just put a video on my channel trying to melt\n glass. We took a Dr. Pepper bottle and melted that in the backyard. And it worked amazingly well. So go check it out.

            "transcription": "Most New Year's resolutions fail. So in this video I want to talk about the science of why they fail and how to avoid that so your New Year's resolutions actually succeed and I want to tell you about three of my New Year's resolutions for 2020.\n The first one is to stop going to news websites. I find I kill a ton of time by doing that. Now don't get me wrong, I do think it's important to know what's going on in the world, but I just don't think following the day-to-day developments of the news cycle\n is the way to do that. So instead I'm going to get one newspaper delivered to my house every week and that is how I am gonna stay informed. Research has shown it is more effective\n to make resolutions at New Year's than at any other time of the year. In fact, one study found that people who made resolutions on January 1st were 10 times as likely to stick with them 6 months later than people who made their resolutions at other times of the year. And January 1st\n 2020 is the first day of a new decade, so it may be even better. Side note, those of you who want to argue that the first day of the decade is actually January 1st, 2021, while you may technically be correct because there was no year zero, we went straight for\n from 1 BC to 180. For all intents and purposes, psychologically, this January 1st is the first day of the 2020s, and that is what matters. So the technicalities I think are unimportant and this argument should be put to bed.\n 2020s start on Jan 1. But now the bad news. Even a resolution made at New Year's will most likely fail. Which is why gyms are packed in January, but they start to clear out by March. Well, research has found that only around\n of people can stick with their resolutions through the end of the year. So why is this? And how do we avoid that trap? I think it all starts with a misconception.\n Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Fugit. Well, this is going to be the part of the video where I ran on the treadmill, but the treadmill's just broken. So, uh, I think the\n The misconception is that people think that in order to make big changes in their lives, that they have to make some sort of really big effort. I mean, let's say your goal was to run a marathon. You might plan on running 10 kilometers three times\n week. That seems kind of proportionate to the end goal and you might be excited and really motivated to do it for the first few weeks, but at some point that motivation is going to lag and running 10k is going to seem too hard and so you're going\n to fall back into old habits. The misconception is thinking you need to go big, and so being overambitious with your goals and then not being able to commit and stick to them. I'm gonna fix this. The truth is, you're much better off if you pick small\n targets that you can hit consistently. That's the idea behind James Clear's book Atomic Habits, which is this idea that if you can get just 1% better every day at something, it will take a minimum amount of effort, but\n over time the effects will compound just like compound interest and James Clear proposes the two minute rule pick something that you can do in just two minutes so if you want to run a marathon start by say running two minutes a day that is\n something that you can't say you don't have time for and once that habit sticks well then you can try to extend it into something more ambitious. The next problem with resolutions is they are too often vague. The most common resolutions that people make\n are to lose weight, exercise more, and to eat better. The problem is those things are so nondescript that it's hard to know if you're making progress and it's really easy to regress into your old habits. So the science around this says you need\n need to be specific and write down your goals. People who write down their goals are 40% more likely to achieve them. That is pretty significant just by taking that step of putting pen to paper. And I'm thinking here in\n this video you should put your New Year's resolutions in the comments because at least that is taking a step towards committing yourself to a goal for the year. My second New Year's resolution for 2020 is to write a\n in a daily planner every day of this year. In fact, I can be more specific than that. I will write one word in this book each day. Now I know one word might seem unhappy,\n helpfully, ridiculously little to write in this book, but I want to commit to this idea of starting small with the idea that if I get in the habit of making the time to at least write down one word on each one of these pages,\n Well then maybe some days I will write more than one word and that will be helpful in terms of planning my day a little bit and so hopefully I will be more productive than I would have been otherwise. And then it's really important to track your progress in an obvious and visual way.\n way and I'm gonna use the Everyday Calendar by Simone Yetch. Oddly satisfying. Where there's\n a button for every day of the year and you can push it and the light turns on and that is really satisfying so I think this will encourage me to write down a word early in the day so that I can go and turn on the light.\n for that day. What's great about this is it's a very visual way to track my progress and to have it in an obvious place where I can look at it all the time. And I'll put it in the back of shot for some of my videos in 2020 so you guys can see how I'm\n progressing towards this goal. So the third major problem with New Year's resolutions is that people seem to think it's about having more willpower or motivation, being able to resist temptation better, but willpower is a finite resource.\n and it can be depleted, there are going to be some bad days, and that is when you're going to relapse. So relying on willpower is not an effective strategy. And research has shown that people who have better self-control actually just have to exercise it\n less. The way they're able to do that is by structuring their environments so they don't have to exercise their willpower. I find in my kitchen it's always like the treats and snacks which are left out on the counter, but the veggies\n which are like tucked away in the vegetable crisper drawer and I get it because you know that's where the veggies are meant to go to keep them crisp but the problem is if I don't see them if they're not in my line of sight I will just end up eating what's on the counter and\n not going digging for veggies. So we need a way of changing our environments so that we make better choices. Which brings me to my third and final New Year's resolution for 2020. I am deleting social\n media apps off of my phone. I'm getting rid of Instagram and Twitter, you are watching the exact moment that I do that. The reason for this is I find I just kill way too much time going into these apps, and research shows that any tiny\n distraction that you have during your day takes you, you know, something like 20-25 minutes to get back into your work. And so I'm losing a lot of time to just procrastinating with these apps. So I'm getting rid of them off my phone so I don't have to use my willpower\n to not click them mindlessly as I normally would. And I've actually downloaded an app that will block news sites and block my social media while I'm working because that way I don't have to restrain myself this time.\n The systems that I put in place will restrain me for me. I know a lot of this sounds a little bit CGP grey, but I think he's on to something. You don't need to follow the day-to-day movements of the news cycle and you do not need to be scrolling social media all the time, particularly when you're trying to get useful work done.\n So that's how I feel. I want to optimize my 2020 by locking down all my potential distractions, not needing any willpower, and I've got some small, specific, and written down, targeted goals.\n targeted with tracking plans for 2020. So I'd love to know what you're planning for 2020 for your New Year's resolutions. What are your plans for the next decade?\n Hey, this episode of Airtasium is supported by viewers like you on Patreon and by Audible. You know what's an excellent habit?

            "transcription": "In popular culture, the term IQ is everywhere. Do IQ exams do that? You probably need 120 points of IQ. Don't up my IQ. IQ. IQ. IQ. Low IQ individual. People who boast about their IQ are losers.\n When people say IQ, what they mean is intelligence, an objective, rigorous measurement of intellectual ability. But does it actually work? Well, in this video, I want to find out where\n IQ came from? What does it actually measure? What can it predict about your life? And I guess what is my IQ? I have never taken an official IQ test before. Honestly, I don't think I'm terribly smart.\n I've always kind of considered my IQ to be maybe just a little above average. Exothermic or endothermic? I feel like that should be... exothermic. Good job, science guy! There are a lot of IQ tests online, but I am very skeptical about their\n accuracy. Still, I figured some of them may be good practice for the real thing.\n The idea of intelligence testing goes back hundreds of years, but the first concrete breakthrough occurred in 1904. English psychologist\n Charles Spearman was studying students' grades in different subjects, and he wondered how their performance in one subject, like English, would relate to their performance in another, like math. One option would be that the better a student did in math,\n the worst they would do in English, maybe because they spent more time on their math work and so had less time to devote to English. So performance in different subjects would be negatively correlated. Another option was that performance in one subject\n subject would be completely unrelated to performance in another. After all, different subjects require different skill sets, so maybe marks would be totally uncorrelated. The third option was that the better a student did in math, the better\n they would do in English. In other words, their marks would be positively correlated. A correlation coefficient can vary anywhere from negative 1 to positive 1. A correlation coefficient of negative 1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.\n meaning an increase in one variable corresponds to a precise, predictable decrease in the other variable. Similarly, a correlation of positive 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. A correlation of 0\n indicates no relationship between the two variables. And any value between 0 and 1 indicates a positive correlation, but the data has some random spread. The square of the correlation coefficient tells you the amount of\n variation in one variable that can be explained by variation in the other variable. For example, if the correlation coefficient is 0.5, then 25% of the variation in one variable can be explained by the other.\n When Spearman analyzed his data, he found a clear positive correlation. Students who did better in math also tended to do better in English, and the correlation coefficient was 0.64. But math and English weren't\n the only subjects the students studied. They also took Classics and French, and when Spearman looked at the correlations between all of these subjects, he found the same pattern. Students who did well in one subject tended to do well in them all.\n So how do you explain this observation? Well, Spearman proposed that each person has some level of general intelligence, what he called the G-factor. This construct was meant to capture how quickly students could\n learn new material, recognize patterns, and think critically regardless of the subject matter, which explains why student scores across subjects are correlated. Those with high G score well on all subjects, and those with low G score poorly on all subjects.\n Spearman published his conclusions in a paper titled, General Intelligence Objectively Determined and Measured. But the correlations weren't perfect. So on top of the g factor, Spearman proposed subject-specific factors.\n A student's performance in math, for example, would depend on their general intelligence plus their subject-specific factor for math. Subject-specific factors could increase or decrease performance on that particular subject.\n Spearman believed that specific factors could be trained, but general intelligence was fixed. So he wanted to find a way to reliably measure general intelligence. At around the same time in France, Alfvarr\n Alfred Binet was tasked with figuring out which kids needed more help in school. Together with Theodore Simone, he developed the Binet-Symon test. Students were asked to name what's missing in the drawing, define abstract terms\n and repeat back sentences. And there was also this question asking which face is prettiest. There were 30 tasks in all. Their performance was benchmarked against other students of different ages in order to assign\n For example, if a student performed about as well as the average 8-year-old, their mental age would be 8. This mental age was then divided by their actual age and multiplied by 100 to arrive at a so-called\n called intelligence quotient. And IQ was born. So the Binet-Symon test was the world's first IQ test. It was translated by Goddard into English and brought to the US.\n At Stanford, Lewis-Turman standardized it using a large American sample, and with some modifications, it became the Stanford-Binet test, and for decades, it was the most widely used test in the United States.\n And this was just the start. Many other IQ tests were developed, and they all had the same goal of measuring the G factor. The way they did this was by assessing many different mental abilities, including memory, verbal,\n and numerical skills. Each one of these areas might have a subject-specific shift, but by averaging them all together, the idea was the subject-specific effects would cancel out, leaving a decent approximation of G.\n Of course, there would always be some error, but that's why psychologists designed IQ tests with upwards of 7 to 10 sections with distinct tasks to try to minimize subject-specific distortions. All the different IQ tests\n differed in the number of questions and their difficulty. So to standardize the scoring system, each test was given to a large sample of the population. Raw scores were normalized, usually so the mean was 100 and the standard\n deviation was 15. This is known as IQ, and it's meant to be a measure of an individual's g factor in comparison to the rest of the population. The way it's scaled\n 68% of people have an IQ between 85 and 115. Only around 2% score over 130 or under 70. 11 lions, 4 cats,\n As I was studying for my IQ test, I practiced all the different types of questions that appear on modern tests. One section will almost certainly be on vocabulary.\n They give you one word, like sanguine, and you have to pick which of the multiple choice options is most similar in meaning. Is it gloomy, asinine, recalcitrant, optimistic, or reflective?\n They might also ask you to pick a word with the opposite meaning. What is the opposite of perspicacious? Is it canny, obsequious, dull, fanciful, or sagacious?\n your ability to spot patterns with numbers. So pick the number that best completes the pattern. 3, 5, 8, 12, what comes next? Originally I was looking for complicated patterns, but as I familiarized myself with the\n online tests, I discovered the patterns were usually pretty simple. A good technique is to find the difference between adjacent terms. So in this case, the first two terms are separated by two, the next by three, and then four. So the logical next term\n should be 5 more than 12, so 17. The answer is C. Sometimes the numbers grow rapidly, like in the sequence 3, 15, 60, 180. What comes next? In cases like this, I look at\n ratio of one number to the one before it. In this case, the second number is 5 times the first, the next number is 4 times bigger, and the next one is 3 times larger. So the answer should be 2 times the fourth term, which\n is 360. Answer B. One of the best known types of IQ test questions are Raven's progressive matrices. These involve a 3x3 grid with symbols in each of the cells. You have to select the 9th cell which follows\n the pattern. I've found that the bulk of these puzzles obey one of only a few different logical rules. One is translational motion, so the symbols move from one cell to the next in a predictable fashion. The second is rotation.\n The third is missing symbols, where in each row or column each symbol appears once, so to figure out which symbols appear in the final cell you just have to spot them.\n which ones are missing. And the fourth is addition, where the first cell plus the second cell equals the third cell. In this case, lines that overlap cancel out, but a line plus nothing equals a line.\n In most modern IQ tests, all the questions are completed under time pressure. You may have only around 10 to 30 seconds per question. Okay, this morning I'm taking an official IQ test and I gotta say that I'm pretty nervous.\n You always want to do well on tests, you know, it's something I pride myself on, but at the same time, you know, who knows how this is going to go. I'm not allowed to take you in there because obviously people don't want the questions getting out and they don't even want video of what it looks like in there, you know, they're very strict about these things.\n So I'm going to go in, do the test, I'll come out and I'll let you know how it went. Wish me luck. What's remarkable about IQ tests is that an hour or two of questions on vocabulary, numbers, and arbitrary shapes can predict a surprising\n For one thing, the higher your IQ, the larger your brain is likely to be. A large meta-analysis from 2005 estimated a correlation of .33 between IQ and brain size.\n So high IQ is literally big brain. IQ is also predictive of school success. In 2007, Scottish psychiatrist Ian Deary measured the IQs of 13,011 year olds. And five years later,\n when these students completed national school examinations, Deary compared their exam marks to their IQs. Their performance on an IQ test when they were 11 correlated with their performance five years later on the GCSEs. About 0.8 that's an extremely\n It means about two-thirds of the variation in national school examination scores could be predicted by IQ tests taken five years prior. Now the correlation coefficient of this study is at the high end of the point two to\n 0.8 range found in similar studies, but research supports the claim that IQ is a good predictor of school success. It also predicts how much schooling a person will complete. Maybe this shouldn't be so surprising, since some school tests are\n essentially IQ tests. It's been argued that tests like the SAT, ACT, and the GRE are basically IQ tests. They correlate with standard IQ tests at around 0.8. Now on my SATs, I got a score of 1330.\n which corresponds to an IQ of around 130. So it'll be interesting to see if my official IQ score matches that, or if I was able to increase my score by familiarizing myself with IQ-style questions. I don't know. But IQ also has predictive power.\n outside of school. One of the most robust findings is that IQ can predict job success. Particularly in technical or high-complexity jobs. How do you measure occupational success? You ask people's bosses.\n The correlations typically range from 0.2 to 0.6, and the effect is most notable for\n more complex jobs, which makes sense. The highest effect is for military training. In fact, the US military will not accept anyone with an IQ under 80. They also limit to 20% the number of recruits with IQs\n between 1981 and 1992. During the Vietnam War, in order to increase the pool of applicants, they relaxed this last requirement. But what they found was that those below the threshold were 1.5\n to three times as likely to fail recruit training, and they required between three to nine times as much remedial training. Taken together, this added so much strain that the military ran more efficiently without the extra\n recruits. In total, 5,478 people recruited under this initiative died, at a fatality rate three times higher than ordinary recruits. So the military reinstated their requirements, and today, anyone with an IQ less than\n Even outside the military, IQ seems to play a role in how long you live.\n tests from kids when they were 11 years old. Now 65 years later they checked to see who from the sample was still alive at age 76 and they found that on average for every 15 point increase on the IQ test you would be 27% more likely to still be alive\n A large meta-analysis confirms that people with higher IQs have a lower risk of dying during the time frame investigated in each study. The last major thing that IQ seems to predict is income.\n This study shows a clear tendency for income to increase with IQ, and it found a correlation coefficient of 0.3. But the variance is huge. In fact, the top three earners in this study all had IQs below 100.\n Meta-analysis of 31 studies found the correlation between IQ and income to be 0.21. That is significant, but small. It means that only 4.4% of the variance in income is explained by IQ.\n for\n Yeah, a lot of people who have very high intelligence scores don't have the same interest in\n The relationship with net worth is even weaker. It hardly seems to correlate with IQ. Even though people with higher IQs are supposedly more intelligent and on average they make more money each year. But this apparently doesn't translate\n into saving or accumulating more wealth overall. But if IQ correlates with school achievement, job performance, income, and longevity, why don't we hear more about it? Why aren't more people tested? I think it's because\n Because IQ has a dark history. When Henry Goddard brought Binet's test to America, its use and interpretation shifted dramatically. In France, Binet believed intelligence could be\n improved through education. He designed his tests so that struggling students could be given more help to catch up. But in the US, the modified test was given to adults, to rank them by intelligence.\n And researchers like Spearman believed that G was unchangeable, that whatever general intelligence you were born with, you would have for the rest of your life. And many thought G was inherited, passed down from\n parents to children. These days we would say it has a genetic basis. There is some evidence to support these assertions. IQ appears fairly consistent over one's lifetime.\n Their scores, 80 years apart, were correlated at around 0.5 to 0.6.\n There's also evidence for a genetic basis to IQ.\n Henry Goddard used the claims that intelligence was inherited and unchangeable to put IQ at the center of the American eugenics movement. Eugenicists wanted to prevent those with\n undesirable traits from having kids. In many states, laws were passed to enable forced sterilization of people who failed to meet a certain threshold on an IQ test. The constitutionality of these laws was upheld\n held by the Supreme Court in 1927. In his judgment, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote,\n In all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime, or to let them star for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. Three generations of imbeciles are enough.\n In total, over 60,000 people were forcibly sterilized as a result of these laws. In fact, they served as a model for Nazi Germany. Hitler himself claimed to be inspired by American eugenicists.\n These have been used for horrific things in the past. At the Nuremberg trials after the war, some Nazis quoted from the American Supreme Court decision. Given this awful history, I think it's understandable that many\n people completely disregard IQ today. On the science of intelligence, there are a number of things those early researchers got wrong. One is that IQ is not entirely determined by genetics. Can you quantify\n the effects of genetics versus environment? When you look at twin studies, on average across the whole lifespan, it's about 50-50 to heritability and environment. You simply can't, for ethical reasons, estimate\n Okay.\n Plus, intelligence might not be a single construct as initially imagined. These days, scientists recognize two forms of intelligence, fluid and crystallized.\n Fluid intelligence is your ability to learn, process information, and solve novel problems, whereas crystallized intelligence involves the knowledge you've accumulated over your lifetime. Both types of intelligence increase throughout childhood, but fluid intelligence\n But IQ has been further misused to promote the idea of racial differences in intelligence.\n gap between the average IQ of black and white Americans. Articles have also been published on the IQs of different nations around the world. Many of these nations are purported to have average IQs below 70. That's the cutoff for intellectual\n The conclusion that some draw is that there are genetic differences between races or nations in intelligence. But I think that's a gross misrepresentation of the data.\n The problem, I'd argue, is that IQ tests don't necessarily measure what you think they're measuring. And the proof is that there's a representative sample of white Americans whose average IQ is 70. Who are these people?\n Just ordinary Americans who lived around a hundred years ago. Researcher James Flynn studied the average results of IQ tests over the past century, and every so often the tests get updated and re-normalized to keep their average\n average at 100.\n population was increasing at a steady rate for the last hundred years, adding up to around a 30 point increase. This is known as the Flynn Effect.\n Now, the genetics of the population haven't really changed over a hundred years.\n So what caused the increase? Well there is some debate about the true causes, but one of them is probably improving childhood nutrition and health. Another cause is better education.\n There's lots of evidence that school makes you more intelligent.\n A third proposed cause is a shift in the types of work that most people do, from mostly manual labor 100 years ago to much more abstract thinking these days. And that shift may have made us better at answering the types of questions\n The point is that IQ tests appear to objectively measure intelligence, but they don't. Even in the same country, separated only by the number of people who are able to measure it.\n Only by time, cultural changes can affect the average scores on IQ tests.\n questions should be equally valid for all cultures. But the truth is, it's impossible to construct such a test.\n such a thing as a completely culture-free or culture-fair test. Culture-fair tests assess visual relations, geometric shapes and patterns, ignoring the fact that cultures differ in, for example, whether they have words for shapes or spatial\n These differences influence how people think about and use categories. It's also debatable whether cultures without printed materials even perceive them in the same way that we do. What culture fair tests don't assess is ethnobotanical knowledge.\n or training dogs to hunt or surviving alone in the rainforest. Arguably these forms of intelligence are more important for survival than knowing say the next number in the sequence but since they are less common in our culture and we don't have good ways of measuring them we\n see IQ puzzles as the definitive way to quantify intelligence. And the people who make these tests agree. There are stringent requirements before a test validated for one population can be used with a very different population. Even in the limited forms of\n intelligence that IQ attempts to assess, there are factors other than G which affect the final IQ. Like motivation. How much someone is incentivized to complete the test can have a marked impact on their score.\n Many studies have tried paying subjects to complete an IQ test. In some studies, they're offered a little, say around a dollar. Other studies offer between $1 and $10, and the real high rollers offer more than $10. A large medical\n Data analysis showed that motivating people in this way increased IQ, and the larger the dollar amount, the greater the average increase. At the high end, IQ increased by up to 20 points. The effect is largest for those with below average IQ.\n So in addition to G, IQ tests also measure motivation. But it doesn't stop there. Training and coaching for an IQ test can boost scores by up to 80%.\n I just completed the test and some random notice... I can barely talk after that. It seemed pretty fair. There were lots of different sections. The math section in particular, I feel like I killed those questions were easy.\n I would say having done the test, I feel like that should be trainable. Like you should be able to train someone to do that well. Test taking strategy is also important. Some people are just better at taking tests under time pressure than others. I think the hardest thing about the test was the time limits.\n looking for the patterns in a series of shapes and it just normally takes me a little while and so I feel like I didn't finish those. You have to know when to skip questions, how to eliminate clearly wrong answers, and when to guess. Anxiety also plays a role.\n Apparently, a small amount of anxiety is good, but past a certain point, it negatively impacts performance.\n I actually got my results from the author of the IQ test I took.\n one\n the\n It's interesting that that one is significantly lower, I guess. And that's not an unusual difference. Around that concept of G, people have strengths and weaknesses. If we were to look at the best estimate of G for you,\n on this set of tests and it'd be different if you took a different test. We said 134 which is higher than 98.8% of the population. Wow. Hopefully you're not disappointed with any of that.\n No, you know, I wanted to do well. I feel like my motivation was high, possibly higher than the average person. So what is IQ good for? My clinical practice now is forensic neuroscience and about 90%\n Can't the criminal just throw a knife at you?\n throw the IQ test. Can't they just intentionally answer every question, Ron? We know that. I mean, we include that just like in the test that you took, there are embedded measures of invalidity. It's detected using various\n Oh wow.\n they go into cognitive decline, it takes them longer to reach the point where they'll have sort of functional, actual everyday problems where they lose independence, whether it comes to dealing with their money or whether it comes to dealing with\n Maybe its best use is in identifying individual\n with strong intellectual abilities who haven't otherwise been able to demonstrate them. Teachers would recommend that a kid gets put in the gifted and talented program because generally they'd observe them doing well in the classroom. But if you replace that with a standardized test,\n an IQ test. You find a higher proportion of poorer kids and kids from minority ethnic backgrounds in the gifted and talented program when you use an IQ test. And the reason is that you're using an objective measure. You're not just relying on some teacher\n Getting into a good school was about who you knew, or who your parents knew, or how much money your parents had. Not so much about how you were doing. The idea that you could try to develop an objective-ish measure that would try and\n and out all those social biases was clearly a well-meaning idea. IQ is something that not only psychology but the general public has a love-hate relationship with. Tell me about that. Psychologists hate to talk about\n it\n IQ but you know we don't really care about that what was it? And then I also think you have the debate about IQ extremes on both sides which I think doesn't help you have the extreme of people who say this is the most\n important thing ever. People's IQ is a majorly important factor that we must know about them and we can classify them into particular schools or particular ways of education or whatever. That's on one extreme and I think that's totally unproductive. But there's another extreme, the other extreme is the kind\n a blank slate view, which is that these tests are completely useless, they don't tell us anything, that they're only a tool of racism and prejudice and so on. I think that's wrong as well. And there's just this massive firestorm on both sides happening around them. And the people in the middle just get\n I think the big mistake is thinking that IQ in some way determines someone's worth.\n What's much more important, in my opinion, is how you interact with and help the people around you. Which is why I think Stephen Hawking said, people who brag about their IQ are losers.\n While IQ tells us something, it doesn't tell us how our lives will turn out.

As you can see, it has the liquid lens that is actually the one responsible for replacing the\n So how does this liquid lens work?\n voltage will cause the polar substance to actually change its shape and go hug or repel the surfaces of the lens. So by changing the shape of the bubble, you change the way light refracts through it as it passes through the two glass windows, and therefore you're changing the focal length.\n the lens. You made an app? Yeah I did. So the screen you're looking at which runs on an app on my smartphone displays a test chart and runs an algorithm to actually do the refraction. I mean those are pretty small letters. Those three static glass lenses are\n able to make it so the light coming from the phone are projected to a virtual distance of that 20 feet so it's basically simulating that that test room but you know optically instead. So the way it works is there's an algorithm running on the smart\n phone app that generates pairs of lens voltages for the patient to compare. And in order to switch between the two lens voltages, the patient can click a button on a pair of headphones. So you can click once to toggle between the two. And once you've found which of the two is\n the best. Okay, that's better. Alright, so you can double click it and it will, you know, indicate to the algorithm that it indeed is the best and generate the next pair. I think it got worse. Yeah, so... And I'm gonna click... Yeah. Okay, that's better, but it's not\n the best I've seen. The algorithm will basically cycle through this lens voltage pair generation process. This is like night and day. It's not even a question. Until it zeros in on the one voltage that works best for you. Okay.\n Okay, that or... Uh-huh, yes. Test complete. Alright, awesome. Would you like to know? I would love to know what my eyesight's like. Alright. So I calculated negative 1.25 diopters, which is roughly in the range\n most people with slight nearsightedness would have. Anna Humphrey wanted to find hidden exoplanets with math. The Kepler Space Telescope has been the most prolific planet finder to date, detecting over 2,000 exoplanets by measuring\n a dip in their host star's brightness when they pass in front of it. But what happens if the planet passes just above or just below the star? Also, what if that planet is really small? Those little tiny shadows are really hard to pull out when you've got a lot of noise.\n A further challenge is that the Kepler mission only ran for four years. To identify planets Kepler might have missed, Anna looked at existing multiplanetary systems and calculated\n whether additional planets could fit in between the ones we observed without disturbing their orbits. I imagine that you already have some sort of planets here so we're gonna call this planet X. So what are these two lines? This line\n here is the same as this outer line. It's how close your imaginary planet can get to your outer planet. And this line here is your AX min. So it's how close your imaginary planet can get to your inner planet.\n So it's this line here. We have this region of stability, given the extremes of where we can put a planet. And we have the maximum mass that you can fit there. And anything in this area here, sort of shade around it.\n anything between these two graphs is a combination of a planet's mass and a location of the planet that we could fit in between the two we know about and maintain a stable system. Cool! Now the question everyone will ask is,\n you is like, what's to say that this planet really exists as opposed to you just making up stuff? So the assumption that I made going into my research was that systems are going to try to have as many planets packed in as possible. This is called the packed planetary\n system hypothesis, there are 560 locations where we could fit additional planets. So quite a few. How might we go about actually finding them? One of the ways you could go about doing this is by doing something called folding the data. So\n So let's say we figure out that a planet should have an orbital period of about one month. If we have a year's worth of data and we fold that data in 12 and get it to line up just right, we can get it so those transit signals actually layer on top of each other.\n We get a larger signal as a that you know we can find As opposed to the really small signals that sort of get lost in the noise. Do you want to introduce yourself? Sure. What's your name? What do you do? My name is Anjali Chada. I am a senior at Dupont Manual High School\n in Louisville, Kentucky. What is this? Anjali was concerned with dangerous contaminants in drinking water. This is a prototype of my arsenic sensor. So you want to load a water sample right here.\n in this compartment. The whole process starts with an automated chemical reaction. So there are a bunch of chemical reagents that sit in this compartment above the water sample. So the first reagent is tartaric acid. Next is a combination of salts. It's called monobstant\n potassium sulfate and then the third is zinc. Arsenic is an element that's never found freely but it's always bound to other elements so basically that chemical reaction will help to free up all of the arsenic and then the arsenic content changes into\n a gaseous form of arsenic gas. And that's the best detectable form of arsenic basically. So what happens after that gas is formed is that there is a test strip and it's covered in mercury bromide which oxidizes in response to the arsenic\n and then changes color. So it's actually on a gradient scale. If there's very little arsenic content, then it changes to a light color, and then there's a lot of changes to dark color and everything in between, right? So what I then did was write an image processing algorithm using\n using some embedded electronic devices. Specifically this device called an ArduCam. It's just an embedded camera and essentially the camera takes a picture of that tester after it's changed color. It then pulls\n out all of the color values of the test strip and converts them into concentration data. So I wrote some mathematical models that kind of make that conversion. And then the last kind of piece of the puzzle is that there is this device, it's a microcontroller called a particle\n and it's connected to this cellular antenna so that the data is instantaneously transmitted to the cloud. And the real advantage of that is that several people would be able to access the data collected from one sensor, whether it's people in the same community who want to connect to the data.\n of have that information and knowledge about their water sources or whether it's people in research organizations who are trying to really learn more, learn what to test, learn what to improve and what sites to really work on. So those are kind of the reasons why I chose to do that.\n So now the moment of truth. Which one of these high school students will win $250,000? Now I should point out that all 40 finalists each receive at least $25,000 with the top 10 receiving more than that.\n winner and recipient of a $250,000 award from TC Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia, Anna Humphrey.\n Congratulations to Anna Humphrey on winning this year's Regeneron Science Talent Service.\n search. If you know any bright American high school students, please consider sending them this video. It could be their turn next up on that stage. And if you are an American high school student, think about these numbers. Around\n 3.6 million students graduate high school in the US each year, but only 2,000 or so apply to the Regeneron Science Talent Search. That means if you enter your science research project, you have a 1 in 50 shot of winning at least $25,000.\n When else in high school do you get the opportunity to get such a financial boost and receive recognition for your ability in science and math? This opportunity could literally be life changing. So take the next step. Click the link in the description and sign up to receive updates about\n the competition. Entries are open to all American high school seniors for next year starting June 1st. And good luck. Now a little epilogue about Anna. You know I asked her what inspired her to pursue this research in the first place and she told me\n Researchers at Caltech had predicted this ninth planet. Do you know what the researchers names were? Mike Brown and Constantine Batygin. I always say his last name. So I took her work and showed it to Constantine Batygin. When I first looked at this\n I was blown away by the fact that this was a high school student. This is done at the very least at the level of a senior undergraduate, maybe a graduate level student.\n I mean, I was a PhD level student. And finally, when I was watching the Black Hole press conference the other morning, We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole.\n Who should be in the audience asking a question? Anna Humphrey. It's like science is in her blood. I expect to see much more in the future from this very talented young scientist. Congrats again, Anna.\n you\n you"

It's unbelievable, but there are two very good reasons why they launched rockets from here. The first is because the ground beneath our feet is moving to the east very fast. Everything\n is going about 900 miles per hour that's 1500 kilometers per hour and that means as your rocket takes off up and to the east it starts off with that velocity. The earth is giving that rocket an initial boost so you don't\n have to put in as much energy, you don't have to speed it up as much. Now the other thing is, if you're gonna fly to the east and something goes wrong with that rocket, you're gonna want it to not hurt anything.

But why are the astronauts floating?\n I'm here at the powerhouse museum in Sydney to find out if anyone knows the answer. Why are they floating? No gravity. No gravity. Zero gravity. There's no gravity. There's no gravity. The stuff that holds us to the planet when we spin doesn't happen up there.\n Gravity holds you down so in space there's nothing there. So you just float. There's no gravity in space. No gravity or there's very little. But is there really no gravity in space? After all, the moon orbits the earth due to gravitational attraction.\n So where would the space station fit in this picture? Can you make me a roughly the scale model of the earth and the moon and then we're going to position the space station in there so about like that? Yeah, about this? Closer, maybe.\n Are you ready to see the real distance? What do you reckon? It's actually about\n here maybe a little further. Now if the moon is here and the earth is there whereabouts would you put the space station? About halfway yeah right about here so that's maybe like a quarter of the distance to the moon.\n Let me show you the real distance you ready for the real distance the space station is right about there The space station is actually\n only about 400 kilometers away. So if you're in Sydney it's a little further than the drive to Canberra. But does it make sense that the earth exerts a big gravitational force on you but nothing on the astronauts just a short distance away? You reckon there'd be\n no gravity there? Well, in truth, the force on the astronauts is almost as\n So then why are they floating while you're stuck here? The answer is the astronauts aren't floating, they're falling. And not only that, but the space station they're in.\n is falling as well. So why doesn't the space station come crashing into the earth? Well the reason is the space station and astronauts inside have this huge sideways velocity of about 28\n So even though they're falling towards the Earth, they're going so fast that as they fall towards the Earth's surface, it curves away from them. If the Earth didn't put a gravitational force on them, they would...\n fly out into space. So it's due to that gravitational pull that they can actually keep orbiting the earth. If it was to stop moving, it would be plummeting. Exactly. But would they? They would still feel weightless until you smash into something.\n So the space station and the astronauts inside are constantly accelerating towards the Earth's core, but they never get any closer. And because they're accelerating at the same rate, the astronauts feel weightless.\n They have this amazing sensation of floating."

            "transcription": "We take it for granted that our universe contains planets, stars, and galaxies because those are the things we see. But the only reason these big structures exist is because of the nature of nothingness, empty space.\n But to understand why we have to go back to the beginning, the very beginning, the Big Bang. You know, I always thought that in the Big Bang, the observable universe started as a point and then just expanded steadily more or less to the point that we're at today.\n But that's not actually how it happened. There were four different phases in the universe's expansion. To start, it was expanding steadily, but then after just a tiny fraction of a second, the expansion just blew up and the whole\n universe increased in size by like 10 to the 26 times in a very short period of time and that period is known as inflation and then just as abruptly as it began inflation stopped and after that the universe\n continued expanding but at a decreasing rate. So the expansion of the universe was actually slowing down, which is exactly what you expect if the universe is full of massive objects that gravitationally attract each other. But then about five or six billion\n million years ago, the expansion of the universe started speeding up again. And this is thought to be caused by dark energy, an energy tied to space. So before that time, there was enough matter, the matter density was high enough, that\n It was pulling everything back together, slowing down the expansion. But once the universe reached a critical size, well then there was enough dark energy to start pushing things apart. And that is the phase that we're still in, the expansion of the universe is accelerating.\n Now this story doesn't really explain the formation of galaxies until you tie in the nature of nothingness. Now ordinarily we think of everything around us as made of particles of atoms and electrons, but our best theories of physics\n are actually field theories that say all of these particles should be seen as just excitations in fields. The word field always gets me because it makes me think of, well, fields. But a field is just something that has a value in\n everywhere in space. So every subatomic particle has its own field. An electron field, an up quark field, a down quark field, a neutrino field, and so on. And anywhere there's an excitation in this field, that is some energy in the field, well that is\n where we will observe particles. So out in completely empty space where the values for all of these fields are basically zero. But here's the thing, it's impossible to make a field perfectly flat\n and zero.\n flat everywhere. Now this is important because ordinarily these fluctuations are really really tiny and they only affect subatomic processes. But during that period of inflation the universe expanded in size so rapidly and so\n so incredibly that those tiny fluctuations got blown up to the scale of the observable universe. Now, without them, we think the matter distribution in the universe would have been completely homogeneous, completely uniform.\n And that means the gravitational force on any object in the universe would have been the same in all directions, which means nothing would ever have collapsed into the big structures that we see today. But thanks to these fluctuations, there were slightly denser and\n less dense regions and of course the denser regions had stronger gravitational fields so they pulled in the matter from around them and that clumped together the matter into huge gas clouds that would go on to be the galaxies that contain the stars and the planets and the things we\n know today. You can actually see the imprint of these quantum fluctuations in the leftover radiation from the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background radiation. The quantum fluctuations in the fields were amplified to big classical fluctuations\n I think it is\n incredible that without these fluctuations in the vacuum, these tiny insignificant things that we take for granted, our universe might really contain nothing. Nothing of interest anyway.\n Speaking of the vacuum, this episode was supported in part by Dyson, who sent me their 360i vacuuming robot. It's got this little camera on the top that can see 360 degrees around it. Now it uses that visual\n Plus some complex math and trigonometry to work out its location precisely and to figure out where it's cleaned already and where it still needs to clean it actually makes a map that you can see on your phone using the Dyson app and you can use that app also to\n control the vacuum or to schedule it even when you're not at home. So I for one welcome robots taking over the housework. If you want to find out more you can click the link in the description.

            "transcription": "Now I've been around Sydney and I've asked people what causes the phases of the moon and you know what they say. How do we get the phases of the moon? Because of the the earth blocks the light that comes\n from the sun? A full moon is basically where we're seeing the full circle of the moon reflected back to earth but the light is actually coming from the sun. And the crescent, the crescents are caused by the shadows of the earth.\n from the sun onto the moon. The phases of the moon, is that about the sun and the moon and the something goes in front of something? The earth's between the moon and the sun.\n we won't see the moon and then as it goes around the earth gets out of the way so more of the sun shines on the moon and we can see the moon, I think. So let's try to resolve it. What really causes the phases of the moon? Phases of the moon, we need to know a couple of things first. One is there's only one sun.\n of light in the solar system and that's the Sun. So at the centre of the solar system it produces all the light. So both the Earth and the Moon are half illuminated by that one source of light. As the Moon moves around the Earth, our perspective on it\n changes because sometimes we see just the unlit face of the moon when the moon is between us and the Sun that's a new moon. Other times we'll see the moon has moved around the earth and we see the moon half illuminated and half dark we'd call that first quarter\n At other times still, when the moon is moved further around the Earth, we see the full illuminated face of the moon and we call that full moon. But it's just because the moon is half illuminated by the sun and it's our perspective on that half illuminated moon.\n which gives the phases. Why doesn't the Earth block the light when we're seeing a full moon? You know, if it's Sun, Earth, Moon, why doesn't the Earth block out the light so we can't see the Moon? You would think that would happen every full moon. You would think the Moon would go through the Earth's shadow at every full moon.\n moon. But in fact the moon's orbit is tilted slightly to the orbit of the Earth around the sun. How much is it tilted? By about five degrees. So virtually every full moon, the moon is moving just above or just below the Earth's shadow. I'm here with Andrew\n Jacobs at the Sydney Observatory and we've just witnessed a total lunar eclipse. So can you tell me what that is? So total lunar eclipse is when normally there will be a full moon but the full moon happens when the moon is in Earth's shadow. So the moon is passing\n through Earth's shadow. It's gone through the outer fainter part of the shadow, gone into the inner darker part and turned red. So why does it look red when it's in the middle of Earth's shadow? Ah, there's three effects here going on. One is that the Earth's atmosphere is refracted.\n directing the light into towards the moon. It's a bit like a prism, is it? A bit like a prism, yes, exactly like that. The blue light, however, is being scattered out by the Earth's atmosphere, just like a sunset. You see a red sunset because the blue light is scattered\n outwards. So that leaves the red light preferentially to get through to the moon and then if there's dust, perhaps volcanic dust in the Earth's atmosphere, that dims the light. So it leads to either a brighter or a darker red colour on the face of the moon.\n use the lunar eclipse for? Why is it important to us? A few years ago I would have said it had no importance at all, not much importance anyway, beautiful thing to look at but not much scientific importance. But nowadays we know that there are planets orbiting around other stars, alien stars,\n exoplanets we call them, and if we can measure the light that's going through Earth's atmosphere and reflecting off the Moon, it can give us an idea of what we might expect to see\n if the light is coming through the atmosphere of an exoplanet orbiting around another star. So we can use the observations of a lunar eclipse around the Earth to infer what the atmosphere of an exoplanet is.\n maybe like. We can detect things like ozone or carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere by looking at the spectrum that reflects off the Moon. And if we see a similar spectrum when we look at an exoplanet around another star, we could infer there is ozone or\n carbon dioxide in that atmosphere. Could you detect water vapor as well? You could detect water vapor as well, yes. And that would obviously be a pretty exciting sign if we saw that. That would be a very exciting sign, yes, yes. All those things together, and perhaps a methane as well, might suggest that there's life out there in the universe.\n you"

            "transcription": "Should I put this down? Yeah, of course. Alright, we're about to do some welding. Goggles off. Here on earth,\n If you want to get two metals to fuse, you have to heat them up past their melting point. But in space, it's a different story, as we found out the hard way. On the 3rd of June, 1937,\n In 1865, astronaut Ed White conducted the first ever American spacewalk aboard Gemini 4. Tethered via a long gold-plated hose, he propelled himself outside the capsule by shooting pressurized oxygen from a handheld gun.\n He enjoyed it so much that flight control literally had to order him back into the spacecraft. Returning to the vehicle, he commented it was the saddest moment of his life.\n Little did he know what would happen next. Inside the spacecraft the crew was faced with a problem. The hatch would not close. For about an hour there was no word from Gemini 4. Flying over Africa they actually went out of range.\n of communication with the ground. But after a lot of wrenching and brute force they got it closed and everything was fine. The original mission called for another depressurization where they would open up the hatch and throw away\n a bunch of bulky gear, things they needed only for the spacewalk. But the pilot, Mcdivitt, radioed to say that under no circumstances were they going to open the hatch again. Flight thought it was because the astronauts wanted to keep the EVA suit and gas guns as souvenirs.\n The astronauts eventually returned to Earth safely, with the extra gear literally stuffed into the footwells of their cramped craft. So what caused the hatch to stick? Well, NASA engineers at the time identified that the failure was due to something called cold welding.\n You see, in space, if two metals come into contact, they can actually fuse together without the need for heat or melting of either piece. The reason for this is due to the fundamental structure of metals, which is a little bit like this candy bar.\n in that they contain a lattice of positively charged ions, like the peanuts, embedded in a sea of freely moving negative electrons, like the caramel. Now, here on Earth, the surface layers of a metal react with the oxygen in the atmosphere,\n create a protective oxide layer and this actually prevents two pieces of metal from joining together. But in space this oxide layer can be worn away like if two pieces of metal are in\n sliding over each other as in hinges. And then the bare pieces of metal with a little bit of force or impact can actually fuse together. So the electrons from one piece of metal can flow into the other.\n As physicist Richard Feynman put it, the atoms have no way of knowing that they're in different pieces. This obviously has huge implications for the construction and maintenance of spacecraft like the International Space Station. So why don't we hear about\n more disasters like this happening in space all the time. I mean, why isn't the ISS already a big welded mess? Well, the truth is that cold welding is not as big of a problem as scientists originally thought it was. I mean, experiments on the ground in vacuum chambers and\n in space have shown that perfectly clean metal surfaces when pressed together in the absence of atmosphere will weld together. But in practice the metals that are used in spacecraft are never that clean. I mean they have those oxygen\n layers on them, not to mention other contaminants, dirt, and grease, and it would take a long time for all of those things to be eliminated so that bare metal touches in space. So the Gemini 4 hatch problem was not actually caused by cold welding.\n It was just a sticky door. But that's not to say that cold welding never happens. For example, in 1991 the Galileo spacecraft was on its way to Jupiter. Now when scientists tried to unfurl its high-gain antenna, which was meant to open like a\n an umbrella. It got stuck. Three of the 18 ribs of the antenna refused to open and this was due in part to the fact that they were cold welded. The pins were stuck in place and nothing the scientists could do would open it.\n And so in the end, they had to scramble to find a way to use the low-gain antenna to send back data from Jupiter, something that it was never meant to do. A 2009 report by the European Space Agency recommended three main ways to reduce the risks of\n cold welding. Number one, where possible use plastics or ceramics to avoid sliding metal on metal contacts. Second, if you have to use metal and metal try to use two different metals, maybe two different metal alloys because that reduces the risks of\n those metals melding together. And third, use durable coatings that resist wear to avoid bare metal on metal contact. But cold welding is not always a bad thing. Scientists have actually found it incredibly useful in fabricating nanotechnology.\n technology. You know traditional welding techniques used on that sort of tiny scale can often go wrong because you're trying to pinpoint heat onto tiny nanowires and you can end up pretty quickly with a melted mess on your hands. So in conditions\n Very similar to the vacuum of outer space, scientists have shown that single crystal gold nanowires fuse to each other in seconds using no heat, just the cold welding technique. And those welds are perfect. The crystalline structure is identical\n to the rest of the nanowire as are the mechanical and electrical properties. So although cold welding is a bit of a potential problem in space, it's actually incredibly useful here on Earth to manufacture nanotechnology.\n Hey, this episode of Veritasium was supported in part by viewers like you on Patreon and by audible.com, the leading provider of audiobooks with hundreds of thousands of titles in all areas of literature including fiction, nonfiction, and period.\n articles.

            "transcription": "Wednesday April 10th 2019 you will probably see the first ever image of a black hole. That's when the Event Horizon telescope will be releasing their results and I haven't seen them yet but I think they're going to\n look something like this and I can be relatively confident because well it's gonna look a bit like a fuzzy coffee mug stain but if you are disappointed by this image I think that misses the gravity of the situation.\n From this image we should be able to tell whether the general theory of relativity accurately predicts what happens in the strong gravity regime. That is, what happens around a black hole. What I want to do here is understand what exactly\n are seeing in this image. So here is my mock black hole of science and this sphere represents the event horizon that is the location from which not even light fired radially away from the black\n hole could be detected by an outside observer. All of the world lines end up in the center of the black hole in the singularity. Once you're inside here, there's no coming back, not even for light. The radius of the event horizon is known as\n Schwarzschild radius. Now if we were just to look at a black hole with nothing around it we would not be able to make an image like this because well it would just absorb all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it. But the black hole that they're looking at specifically the one in the center\n of our Milky Way galaxy Sagittarius A star has matter around it in an accretion disk. In this accretion disk there is dust and gas swirling around here very chaotically it's incredibly hot we\n we're talking millions of degrees and it's going really fast a significant fraction of the speed of light and it's this matter that the black hole feeds off and gets bigger and bigger over time but you'll notice that the accretion disk does\n not extend all the way in to the event horizon. Why is that? Well that's because there is an innermost stable circular orbit and for matter around a non-spinning black hole that orbit is at\n three-swart-shield radii. Now in all likelihood the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be spinning, but for simplicity I'm just considering the non-spinning case. You can see my video on spinning black holes if you want to find out more about that.\n So this is the innermost orbit for matter going around the black hole. If it goes inside this orbit it very quickly goes into the center of the black hole and we never hear from it again. But there is something that can orbit\n orbit closer to the black hole and that is light. Because light has no mass, it can actually orbit at 1.5 Schwarzschild radii.\n Now here I'm representing it with a ring but really this could be in any orientation so it's a sphere of photon orbits and if you were standing there of course you could never go there but if you could you could look forward and actually see the back of your\n head because the photons could go around and complete that orbit. Now the photon sphere is an unstable orbit meaning eventually either the photons have to spiral in to the singularity or spiral out and\n head off to infinity. Now the question I want to answer is what does this black quote-unquote shadow in the image correspond to in this picture of what's actually going on around the black hole? Is it the event\n horizon are we simply looking at this or is it the photon sphere or the innermost stable circular orbit? Well things are complicated and the reason is this black hole warps space-time around it which changes the path of light rays so\n So they don't just go in straight lines like we normally imagine that they do. I mean, they are going in straight lines, but space-time is curved, so yeah, they go in curves. So the best way to think of this is maybe to imagine parallel light rays coming in from the observer\n and striking this geometry here. Of course if the parallel light rays cross the event horizon we'll never see them again so they're gone that will definitely be a dark region but if a light ray comes in just above the event horizon it too will get bent and end up\n crossing the event horizon it ends up in the black hole. Even a light ray coming in the same distance away as the photon sphere will end up getting warped into the black hole and curving across the event horizon. So\n So in order for you to get a parallel ray which does not end up in the black hole, you actually have to go out 2.6 radii away. If a light ray comes in 2.6 Schwertschild\n radii away, it will just graze the photon sphere at its closest approach and then it will go off to infinity. And so the resulting shadow that we get looks like this. It is 2.8\n six times bigger than the event horizon. You say what are we really looking at here? What is this shadow? Well in the center of it is the event horizon. It maps pretty cleanly onto the center of this shadow. But if\n you think about it light rays going above or below also end up crossing the event horizon just on the back side. So in fact what we get is the whole back side of the event horizon mapped onto a ring\n this shadow. So looking from our one point in space at the black hole we actually get to see the entirety of the black hole's event horizon. I mean maybe it's silly to talk about seeing it because it's completely black but that really is\n where the points would map to on the shadow. It gets weirder than that because the light can come in and go around the back and say get absorbed in the front you get another image of the entire horizon next to that in another annular ring.\n And then another one after that and another one after that and you get basically infinite images of the event horizon as you approach the edge of this shadow. So what is the first light that we can see? It is those light rays that come in at just such an angle that they graze the photon sphere and\n then end up at our telescopes and they produce a shadow which is 2.6 times the size of the event horizon. So this is roughly what we'd see if we happen to be looking perpendicular to the accretion disk.\n but more likely we will be looking at some sort of random angle to the accretion disk. We may be even looking edge on. And in that case, do we see this shadow of the black hole? You might think that we wouldn't, but the truth is because\n of the way the black hole warps space-time and bends light rays, we actually see the back of the accretion disk. The way it works is light rays coming off the accretion disk bend over the top and end up coming to our telescopes. So what we end up\n is something that looks like that. Similarly light from the bottom of the accretion disc comes underneath gets bent underneath the black hole and comes towards us like that and this is where\n get an image that looks something like the interstellar black hole. It gets even crazier than this because light that comes off the top of the accretion disc here can go around the back of the black hole\n graze the photon sphere and come out the bottom right here producing a very thin ring underneath the shadow. Similarly light from underneath the accretion disk in the front can go underneath and around the back and come out over the top which is why we\n we see this ring of light here. This is what we could see if we were very close to the black hole, something that looks truly spectacular. One other really important effect to consider is that the matter in this increase\n disc is going very fast, close to the speed of light, and so if it's coming towards us it's going to look much brighter than if it's going away. That's called relativistic beaming or Doppler beaming. And so one side of the secretion disc is going to look much brighter than the other and that's\n why we're gonna see a bright spot in our image. So hopefully this gives you an idea of what we're really looking at when we look at an image of a black hole. If you have any questions about any of this please leave them in the comments below and I will likely be making\n a video for the launch of the first ever image of a black hole so I'll try to answer them then. Until then I hope you get as much enjoyment out of this as I have because this has truly been my obsession for like the last week.\n I guess what would be exciting is to watch it over time, how it changes, right? There's a lot of hope that there are blobs moving around and you know if you see a blob going around the front and then it goes on the back and then you see\n in the back image etc. that that's going to be kind of cool."

            "transcription": "On November 22nd, 2014, a burst of x-rays was detected by ASSASSIN. That's the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. But this was no supernova. The signal came from the center of a galaxy around 290 million years ago.\n light years away. And what we now believe happened was a star came too close to a supermassive black hole with a mass millions of times that of our Sun and it was eaten. The black hole fed on the star. And yes this is the actual terminology\n astrophysicists use to describe it. Events like these are thought to be rare, occurring maybe once every 10 to 100,000 years in a galaxy. They're called tidal disruption events or tidal disruption flares. As the star approached, the side closer\n The forces to the black hole experienced a much stronger gravitational pull than the other side, ripping the star to shreds. Matter spiraling into the black hole formed an accretion disk, an annular ring of gas and dust that's accelerating and heating up, emitting visible\n light, UV and x-rays observable from Earth. Now what's remarkable about this event is that it transformed a dormant or quiescent black hole, one that wasn't really feeding, into one that we can observe thanks to the matter falling in from that star.\n this is what it looked like. Okay, if you're disappointed check out these artist renditions of the same event. But if you're cynical you might say, well how do we know that\n That's what really happened. What if the scientists are just making this up to get more grant funding or to inspire people to go into science? Well, I'll explain how we know this is actually what went down. But first things got weirder. Scientists trained three x-ray telescopes\n to observe this part of the sky for years after the event. And what they found was a strong and regular pulse of x-rays brightening and dimming every 131 seconds. And it shows up in the data from all three telescopes. They observed periodically\n over 450 days, but the pulse maintained this rhythm and didn't get weaker. In fact, as time went on, the relative strength of the pulse got stronger, modulating the X-ray signal by around 40%. What was causing these periodic flashes of X-rays?\n And what could it tell us about the black hole? Well, let's back up because black holes are some of the simplest objects in the universe. By that, I just mean that they are characterized by only two attributes, mass and spin. Okay, there's also\n charge but since black holes should essentially be neutral mass and spin are the two that count. Mass is relatively easy to determine. Far away from a black hole you can even use Newtonian physics by measuring the gravitational effects of the black hole on other\n bodies you can estimate the mass of the black hole. This has been done and black holes have been found with masses ranging from just a few times our Sun stellar mass black holes up to billions of solar masses supermassive black holes. It's generally accepted that there is a supermassive\n supermassive black hole at the centers of most galaxies, including our own. But what about spin? Since black holes form from collapsing stars and all known stars rotate, all black holes should also be rotating. I mean, what are the\n chances that a bunch of matter just collapses into a point perfectly with no rotation. It's just not going to happen. And then additional matter falling into the black hole contributes its angular momentum. So like a figure skater pulling their arms into a porous\n object, you can imagine black holes get spinning pretty fast. But spin is harder to measure because unlike mass, it only affects objects relatively close to the black hole. But there is a way to do it. Actually, three ways. To understand all of them, you have\n have to understand ISCO. In Newtonian physics, around a compact mass you can place an object in a circular orbit at any radius and it will be stable. It doesn't matter how close you get. This is not the case according to general relativity. Here there\n is\n of the accretion disk is at our isco. What's useful for our purposes is that our isco depends on the spin of the black hole. The faster it's spinning, the smaller our isco becomes, assuming it's spinning in the same direction as the matter in the accretion disk.\n The rotation enables particles to orbit closer to the black hole than they'd be able to for a non-spinning black hole. So you can kind of think of it as though the spin is supporting the particles against the relentless pull of gravity. Now spin is normally discussed in terms\n of a dimensionless parameter that ranges from zero, no spin, to one, maximum spin. Though I guess you could also have spins down to negative one if the black hole is spinning in the opposite direction from the accretion disk. Now as spin increases, our ISCO decreases.\n by a factor of 6, shrinking down to the size of the event horizon. And this sets what many scientists think is the maximum span a black hole can have. Because if the minimum stable orbit were the size of the event horizon, then light could escape from the black hole\n allowing us to see into the singularity. This is called a naked singularity and it makes a lot of scientists uncomfortable. As yet, there isn't a strong theoretical reason why a black hole can't exceed this maximum spin. It's just that we haven't seen one and the thought of an exposed\n singularity just kind of feels wrong. Most suspect the maximum real-world spin parameter is around 0.998. So how can you use our Isco to measure the spin of a black hole? Well first let's think about how we measure the size of anything\n far away from us in deep space like the radius of a star. Most stars are so far away that they're simply point objects in our telescopes. So how can you figure out their radii? Well first look at the spectrum of their light and by seeing how red shifted absorption lines are you can\n determine how far away the star is. The spectrum also tells you the temperature of the star, because it should approximate a blackbody curve. And now the power radiated per unit area of the star is strongly dependent on its temperature. So if you know how bright the star appears\n from Earth, how far away it is, and how much power it's radiating per unit area, well then you can work out its area and hence its radius. You can actually do something very similar for a black hole's accretion disk. Just instead of estimating the radius of a glowing sphere,\n you're estimating the radius of the dark circle, R-ISCO, in the middle of the glowing accretion disk. Then you can use R-ISCO to find the spin parameter. This has been done for a number of black holes, revealing spin parameters from around 0.1 up to close to the maximum.\n But this method only works if the radiation from the black hole is dominated by black body radiation from the accretion disk, which often it's not. Another approach involves looking at x-rays emitted by iron around a black hole. Some black holes show a distinct iron\n emission line but instead of the single frequency you'd expect the line is broadened by factors like the Doppler shift due to the high velocity of the iron in the accretion disk and gravitational redshift due to the extreme gravitational fields close to the black hole. By looking at the\n low energy limit of the iron emission line you can determine how close to the black hole it was emitted and hence our isco but what if there is no bright iron emission line well luckily there is a third way and that is to look for periodic oscillations in\n the data, like the repeated x-rays observed every 131 seconds. The thinking is these cycles must be caused by clumps of matter orbiting the black hole. And at frequencies that high, they must be orbiting very close in, probably near our ISCO.\n Even that close, they'd be going half the speed of light. But what kind of clumps or objects would these be? Well, the study's authors argue the best candidate involves an unlikely scenario. Years before the tidal disruption event, they propose there was a white dwarf star in\n orbit around this black hole. Now it might be stable orbiting in this way for perhaps one or two hundred years. By itself it wouldn't be visible from Earth. But then the other star wandered by and was ripped apart in the tidal disruption event. Its mass fell into\n toward the black hole forming an accretion disk. With the addition of this stellar debris, the white dwarf was cloaked in glowing matter, creating an x-ray hotspot orbiting the black hole, and its period would directly relate to the spin of the black hole. In this case, the measured\n spin parameter turned out to be at least 0.7 and possibly as high as the theoretical maximum of 0.998, meaning objects in the accretion disk were going at least half the speed of light. This is the first measurement of spin made possible by a tidal disruption event.\n The implication is that this could provide a method for determining the spin of black holes, particularly ones that have been dormant, which is about 95% of supermassive black holes. If they shred a star, we get insight into their spin. Now why is this\n important? Well, because it helps us understand the origins of black holes. If supermassive black holes grow in size mainly by feeding on a steady stream of matter from within their own galaxy, you'd expect their spins to be very large because the angular momentum\n of that matter would be more or less aligned. So it would add up over time. But if instead supermassive black holes grow predominantly by merging with other large black holes, you might expect their spins to be lower because the spins of two black holes are likely to be randomly oriented.\n As we are able to measure the spins of more black holes in different ways, farther out and therefore further back in time, we should be able to better understand their growth. And since supermassive black holes lie at the centers of most galaxies, they\n They also lie at the center of an understanding of how those galaxies have formed and evolved over billions of years.\n you"

            "transcription": "A portion of this video was sponsored by Salesforce. More about Salesforce at the end of the show.\n In the spectrum of the Sun, you see these dark lines. And we see those same lines in the spectra from galaxies, except they're shifted to longer wavelengths, towards the red end of the spectrum. So we say their light is red-shifted.\n Now, the usual explanation for this redshift is that as the light is traveling through expanding space, the photons themselves become stretched, so short wavelengths get longer. And this is known as cosmolitanism.\n The explanation is fairly intuitively satisfying and most people go on without giving it a second thought. But the problem is, if you do give it a second thought, you think, well, if expanding space can stretch something like a photon, something that's so\n incredibly tiny, does it also stretch atoms and molecules? Is expanding space stretching stars and galaxies? And what about you? Are you expanding with the universe?\n To answer these questions we've got to take a closer look at what it really means to redshift. Physicists actually talk about three different types of redshift. Doppler redshift where observers moving relative to one another\n measure photons to have different wavelengths, gravitational redshift, where observers at different locations in a gravitational field measure different wavelengths, and cosmological redshift, where observers exchanging photons over vast cosmological distances in\n expanding universe measure different wavelengths. These three cases appear very different and they're governed by different equations. So how does each redshift actually occur? Let's start with a photon in a gravitational field.\n There is this famous experiment conducted in 1959 by Pound and Rebka sending photons up and down a 22 meter tower at Harvard. Now they used gamma rays but I'll represent them with a visible light. They found that photons\n The photons detected at the top of the tower were redshifted relative to the source, by the exact amount predicted by general relativity. Which is a tiny amount. I'm dramatically exaggerating the effect just so you can see it.\n Along the photons path does this redshift take place? Well it seems to happen continuously. The photon loses a little bit of energy each millimeter it climbs up that tower. Meaning that the photon in the middle of the tower\n Now, according to Einstein's equivalence principle, being at rest on Earth's surface is indistinguishable from being in a rocket in deep space accelerating up at 1g. So, we could do the same in\n experiment in a rocket ship and we should get the same result. If we send blue photons from the back of the rocket they should be red when they reach the front and in the middle of the ship they would appear green. This is exactly what we saw at the\n rest in a gravitational field so the equivalence principle holds. Now imagine there are a line of external observers just hanging out in space at rest relative to each other and they can all see into the rocket.\n Let's also say the rocket is initially at rest and the thrusters are switched on the instant the photon is released. Now since both observers are at rest at this moment, they will both measure the photon as having the exact same wavelength. It's blue. But what about when\n the photon reaches the middle of the rocket. But we know someone inside will see it as green. But what about a stationary observer outside? Well, to them, the photon has just been moving through ordinary flat spacetime. So it must look\n blue, just as blue as it was when it was emitted. So what's the deal? How can the same photon look green and blue at the same time? Has the equivalence principle been violated? The answer is no.\n It matters a lot to this measurement who is doing the observation. Consider this, after the photon is emitted the rocket accelerates, it's speeding up, so by the time the photon reaches the middle of the rocket everyone inside is now\n moving at high velocity relative to the source when the light was emitted, and relative to the observers outside the rocket. So it makes sense that the photon as measured inside will look different, it'll be redshifted. This is the Doppler redshift, because\n the observer in the middle of the ship is moving very quickly away from the source. By the time the photon makes it to the top of the rocket, well the rocket will be going even faster and this is why it appears red. But to a stationary observer outside, well it's still\n looks blue. This thought experiment shows us that wavelength and energy are not intrinsic properties of photons. They are properties of the photon observer system. Now let's recreate\n the Harvard Tower experiment. Observers in the building see the photon redshifted as it climbs. But here's a question for you. What would a free-falling observer see? Well they would be just like the stationary observer\n in space watching the rocket accelerate up. The physics of these two situations are identical so they would measure no redshift. To them the photon would look blue the whole time. What I want to show is that there are\n aren't actually three different types of redshifts, there is only one. We've seen that the gravitational redshift can equivalently be seen as a Doppler redshift when we do the same analysis in an accelerating rocket ship. So what about cosmological redshift\n shift. Well for this we have to zoom way out past our solar system, the Milky Way galaxy, our local cluster of galaxies. We want to zoom so far out that the galaxies in the observable universe\n are like molecules in a fluid, the cosmic fluid. At this scale, we can treat the whole universe as being smooth and uniform. Cosmologists say it is homogeneous. And just as you don't notice the individual\n molecules in a cup of water, at this scale we don't notice the individual galaxies in the cosmic fluid. And the cosmic fluid looks the same in every direction. There is no preferred orientation. It's said to be isotropic.\n Now what you'll notice is that the cosmic fluid is spreading out. It doesn't matter where you look, you see the same thing. Things moving apart. The density of the cosmic fluid is decreasing over time.\n And this is the basic property of an expanding universe. We can draw some coordinates on the universe, we could pick any different coordinate system we like, but one way it's often done is to make a coordinate system that expands with the\n cosmic fluid. So there will be certain observers whose coordinates don't change over time. And these are known as co-moving observers. They are at rest with respect to the cosmic fluid. By the way,\n On Earth, we are not a co-moving observer. Our galaxy is moving at 600 km per second relative to the cosmic microwave background radiation. Now, let's pick two co-moving observers a large distance apart, and have them exchange\n photon. Its wavelength will be stretched by the amount the universe has expanded during the photon's journey. This is the standard picture of cosmological redshift. But now consider a bunch of other co-moving observers along the path of the\n this photon. Each one absorbs the photon and instantaneously emits another, identical to the one they measured. Now each successive observer will measure a slightly longer wavelength than the observer before them, the photons stretching out just\n as you'd expect in an expanding universe. But the reason they would give for this redshift would be different. To each observer, their neighboring co-moving observers would appear to be moving away from them in locally flat spacetime.\n time, so they would attribute the increase in wavelength to the Doppler shift, just due to the relative motion between them. The entirety of the cosmological redshift, then, can equivalently be thought of as the result of a long\n series of Doppler shifts. What we've seen is redshifting is not something that happens to a photon itself. Instead it depends on what's happening to observers at the point of emission and absorption of that\n photon. And because of this, there are actually not three different types of redshift, there's only one described by a single underlying mathematical framework. They only look different depending on your frame of reference. Now it can be convenient to talk about if\n expanding space when you have two co-moving observers exchanging a photon over vast distances in an expanding universe, then the photons wavelength is just stretched by the amount the universe expanded during its journey. That's nice and simple, but you can equally well\n describe the redshift by a long chain of Doppler shifts, no expanding space required. The misconception is to think that because photons are redshifted as they travel\n across the universe, that means expanding space is pulling on things and stretching things apart. That's not how it works. Space is not like that. So let's come back to the central question of this video, which is do you expand\n with the universe? The answer is no. Because on the scale of people, the universe is not homogeneous. I mean, matter is condensed down into objects and the earth. And the universe is not isolated.\n Looking up looks decidedly different from looking down. The basic assumptions we made about our expanding universe just don't apply here. I mean, the local spacetime curvature is dominated by the\n by the Earth. So what if we took you out into deep space, the middle of nowhere, then would you expand?

            "transcription": "On July 20th, 50 years ago, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first set foot on the moon. But before they went there, they came here. This is Sedan Crater and it was excavated by a nuclear bomb in 19\n It's part of the Nevada Test Site, an area of desert bigger than Rhode Island. Located 70 miles northwest of Las Vegas. Here, the U.S. performed 900\n 128 nuclear explosions. And from 1965, they trained Apollo astronauts like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin before their trips to the moon. In the following years, astronauts returned with spacesuit\n mockups and TV cameras. They even tested out a mockup of the lunar roving vehicle. Over a period of seven years, 11 of the 12 men who would eventually walk on the moon visited this site. So why would you bring a\n Apollo astronauts to a nuclear bomb test site. That's what we're going to find out. The obvious reason is because the moon is covered in craters, so the astronauts needed experience in cratered terrain. But there\n There were other locations available, like Barringer Crater in Arizona, claimed to be the site of a meteorite impact, though its origins were disputed until the 1960s. In another part of Arizona, scientists used conventional\n explosives to recreate the exact pattern of craters on the moon around the Apollo 11 landing site. Now the astronauts did train at both of these sites, but the Nevada test site provided something extra.\n The Nevada test site was commissioned in 1951 as a place to test nuclear explosions. The goal was not only to develop better\n bombs, but also to understand how homes and household items could be made to withstand a nuclear blast.\n A hundred tests were conducted above ground\n before the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963. It banned testing in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, leaving only underground testing, like the blast that formed Sedan Crater.\n A one meter wide hole was drilled down into the ground right here 635 feet deep and that is where they located a nuclear bomb. It was a hundred and four kiloton device. That means\n This means the energy released was equivalent to 104,000 tons of TNT, roughly eight times as big as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. This close-up view was taken from a ground station three miles from ground zero.\n The dome rose to a height of 290 feet before it vented at three seconds. It excavated 12 million tons of dirt and rock forming what is the largest\n man-made crater in North America. In fact, it's the second biggest in the world after Shagan Crater in Russia. It's about 400 meters in diameter and nearly a hundred meters deep. This was part of an operation called Plowshare.\n is conducting for the benefit of all nations a program it calls Plowshare. With the idea being if you need to form a big hole somewhere, let's say you're making a huge construction\n construction project, maybe a canal, could you use nuclear weapons to excavate that dirt?\n As you can see, it's a pretty good excavator, but later they found out that it's very hard to reduce the contamination.\n But what they had created was the closest thing you can get to a meteorite impact crater.\n When I think about meteor impacts, I imagine the sort of compressions of a big rock coming in and pushing the dirt out of the way. But that's not actually how it works. Meteors are typically going incredibly fast, like 10 or 20\n 20 km per second. So when one strikes the ground, it creates an incredibly hot, dense high pressure region at the site of the impact. This melts and vaporizes rock. A shockwave travels\n falling out from the point of contact transforms minerals due to the extreme pressure. As the high pressure region decompresses, it creates what is essentially a huge explosion, and it is this explosion that creates the crater.\n Something you might notice if you look at craters is they're almost always circular. But if you think about it, meteors impact from all sorts of different angles. The reason you're seeing a circle is because really a meteor impact is\n An explosion. That is what forms the crater. It's not the impact. Otherwise you would see all sorts of weird oblong shaped craters. Nuclear explosions are so much like meteorite impacts that craters on this test site provided the definitive evidence\n This is a very interesting evidence confirming that Beringer crater was in fact the result of an impact. Scientists compared samples from both sites and found the same shocked minerals like coasite, a shocked form of quartz.\n only be formed under the intense pressure of a meteorite impact or a nuclear explosion. Further similarities with nuclear test craters allowed scientists to estimate that the energy of impact was around 10 megatons. That's the\n of a fairly big thermonuclear detonation. Another similarity is in how these cratering events excavate rock. All of this dirt got excavated out of here, 12 million tons, and it was ejected out and over the rim and\n And what actually happens in that process is the layers of rock actually get turned over at the rim. It's called inverted stratigraphy. This is a telltale sign of meteorite impacts and nuclear explosions, and it helped the astronauts\n know when they collected samples on the moon what to look for and where.\n science, visiting sites like this one where they could learn about geology, about the rocks and minerals and the formations that they should look for when they're on the moon. And I guess it makes sense because these were scientific\n missions, but they weren't conducted by professional scientists. By and large, the Apollo astronauts were expert pilots. As Apollo 11 blasted off, the astronauts were journeying into the unknown, literally.\n knew so little about the moon, like how it formed, what it was made of, and whether or not it was volcanically active. When the Apollo astronauts were on the moon, they actually used\n used some of their training from here. The astronauts were really excited when they found the rocks that they recognized.\n In fact, it was probably due to their training here that they were able to recognize those minerals.\n and those rocks which were so important to bring back and to learn not only about the moon's formation but also about our entire solar system and the formation of all the planets. This is the actual moon dust or lunar regolith.\n collected by the Apollo 11 astronauts. I'm gonna take a look at it under the microscope. Now since the moon has basically no atmosphere, all of this material had never been exposed to oxygen. So there was some concern that one\n Once the astronauts brought it back into their spacecraft and introduced some oxygen, that it would spontaneously catch fire. So Buzz recounts the story of how they were ready to throw all the samples out if that were to happen.\n But, of course, thankfully, nothing did happen when they brought those samples in and repressurized the lunar module. Amongst the dark lunar dust that Apollo 11 brought back, scientists identified tiny flecks of a light-colored rock, which they\n they immediately identified as anorthosite. And that was an important discovery because it supported the theory that in the past the moon was entirely melted, covered in a magma ocean at least 100 kilometers thick.\n So the idea goes that when anorthosite forms, when the minerals that make it up crystallize out, they are less dense than the magma around them, so they float to the surface. So the initial surface of the moon, the primordial surface of the moon, would have been made\n of anorthosite. And then about a billion years later there was more volcanic activity on the moon leading to lava flows over these regions that are darker called the mare. And you can see they have fewer craters on them because, well,\n younger. So how do you get anorthosite over here in the Sea of Tranquility? Well that must have happened through giant impacts in the highlands which would have sprayed ejecta all over the moon and so it got mixed\n mixed in with the dark soil over here and brought back by the astronauts to my petri dish where I can look at it today. But anorthosite was just the tip of the iceberg. Inside all of these samples was a subtle clue to how the moon\n formed. Looking at the amounts of different isotopes in a rock can tell you where that rock came from. And when scientists analyzed the moon rocks, they found the same isotopic abundances as in Earth rocks. This is why we\n We believe today that the Earth and Moon formed together from the same event, a giant impact between planets, four and a half billion years ago. Going to the Moon and knowing what to look for taught us not only\n how the moon formed, but also how our earth formed. And all this from less than 400 kilograms of moon rock from the near side of the moon. Clearly there is still a lot to learn up there, and personally I can't wait\n until we go back. Who knows what unexpected discoveries are waiting for us when we return?\n audible. For the last few weeks I have been re-listening to A Man on the Moon by Andrew Chaykin.

            "transcription": "This episode was sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show. Until recently, half the universe was missing. Or hidden, or just undetected. And no, I'm not talking about dark matter or dark\n energy which make up 27 and 68 percent of our universe respectively. Now I'm talking about normal ordinary matter which makes up you and me and the planets and stars and nebulae and basically everything you can see. And since most\n of this stuff is made of protons and neutrons which are forms of baryons this has been known as the missing baryon problem we expect the universe to be made up of five percent baryonic matter but when we go looking we only find\n Now the first question you're probably asking is, why should we expect the universe to be 5% ordinary baryonic matter in the first place? The answer is, because with that density we can explain the relative\n abundances of different elements that we observe in the universe, specifically the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen to helium. In the beginning, like right after the Big Bang, there were all of these neutrons and protons\n But as the universe expanded, it cooled to the point where protons and neutrons could start fusing together. A particularly stable nucleus to form\n would be helium-4, made of two neutrons and two protons. The problem was, to form helium-4, you first have to form deuterium, one proton and one neutron. And this is a less stable nucleus, and as quickly as it formed,\n it would get smashed apart. But by about 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled sufficiently that deuterium could form, and as soon as it did, it would rapidly fuse into helium. The rate at which this happened depended\n on the density of matter in the early universe. The higher the density, the faster this fusion could occur. Then, by 20 minutes after the Big Bang, the temperature had dropped low enough that fusion could no longer occur. So at this point, the\n fundamental abundances were locked in. Like a snapshot of this moment. There was 75% hydrogen and 25% helium by mass, which is basically still what we observe in the universe today. Of the hydrogen nuclei,\n 36 out of every million were deuterium. What's amazing about deuterium is that it's stable, it doesn't decay, and there are no known processes that can produce it in significant quantities\n since the Big Bang. And that means virtually all the deuterium in the universe today, including the one out of every 6,000 hydrogen atoms in tap water, was created not in stars, but in the first 20 minutes after the Big Bang.\n When we look deep into space, the oldest light we can see is the cosmic microwave background radiation, the afterglow of the Big Bang, which has been traveling through the universe unimpeded since about\n 400,000 years after the Big Bang and so we can literally count up those photons and work out the density of radiation right after the Big Bang and using the value of 26 deuterium nuclei per million\n hydrogen nuclei, well we can work out the ratio of baryonic matter to photons and that is how we work out that there should be about 5% baryonic matter in the universe. So in the late 1990s scientists went looking for\n all this baryonic matter. It was a census of sorts. They added up all of the planets and stars and black holes, galaxies, dust clouds, gas, basically everything you can see or infer\n exists using a telescope. And what they found is that everything that I normally think of as the actual stuff in our universe, it only makes up barely 20% of all the baryonic matter. So where\n Where is the rest? Well, not all ordinary matter is glowing brightly or is illuminated by nearby stars. It's not dark matter, but it is ordinary matter that is just in darkness. And so, if you want to\n To find those baryons, well, one way is to use a backlight. A bright source of light very far away, and that also means in the very early universe. And quasars are the perfect backlight.\n The light comes from the accretion disk of a supermassive black hole at the center of an early galaxy, as it engulfs all this matter. And since it is so small, it is not a matter of size.\n So distant the light we receive from quasars is heavily redshifted For example the light emitted when a hydrogen atom goes from its first excited state to its ground state the Lyman alpha transition it produces ultraviolet light of around 121\n 1.6 nanometers in a lab. But from a quasar, it can be observed as a peak in their spectrum at over 560 nanometers. That is yellow light. What's fascinating is if you look to the left of this peak,\n you see many little dips. These are absorption lines created by neutral hydrogen atoms that lie along our line of sight with the quasar. When light from the quasar reaches neutral hydrogen, the photons that can excite\n the electrons from the ground state to the first excited state are absorbed. This is the same Lyman-alpha transition. But since these patches of hydrogen gas are closer to us, they are less redshifted. So the notches they make in the spectrum\n This has been described as the Lyman Alpha Forest. It's like a one-dimensional map that shows us where and\n How much neutral hydrogen gas lies along the line connecting us to the quasar? Adding all of that neutral hydrogen gas into our baryon budget brings us almost to 50%.\n So where is the other half of the baryons? Well, computer simulations of the entire universe suggested they are out there, just in between the galaxies in these sheets or filaments, and they're very\n spread out, just 1 to 10 particles per cubic meter. Plus, these particles are ionized so they don't absorb the light like the neutral hydrogen gas. And they're in a temperature range between about 100,000 and 10 million Kelvin.\n a range astronomers like to refer to as warm-hot. So this is known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium, or WIM for short. But finding the WIM has been a real challenge. Because they're ionized and because of their temperature,\n only emit or absorb in the high energy UV or low energy x-rays. Now some people have used very sophisticated techniques to try to find the whim, but then recently a naturally occurring physical phenomenon allowed us to\n Let's find out how. First, we need to talk lightning. And I promise this is related. Okay, so did you know that it's possible to detect lightning from the other side of the earth?\n This is because lightning produces a flash of electromagnetic radiation in all parts of the spectrum. I mean, we see the white light, but there's also broad spectrum radio waves which are released, and if you were nearby you could detect those as a\n pulse. But the very low frequency radio waves can actually travel up and out of the atmosphere and they get guided along the Earth's magnetic field lines out several radii from the Earth and then back down where they can be detected\n in the other hemisphere. Except if they're detected there, they don't come in as a single pulse. Instead, they are spread out as a whistler. Now if you play these radio waves through a speaker, we can actually hear them. So listen to this.\n You hear that descending tone that sounds like a sci-fi laser gun? Yeah, that is lightning on the other side of the earth. So what's happening here?\n Well, as the radio waves travel through the Earth's magnetosphere, they encounter free electrons, which slows them down, and more for the lower frequency waves. This is dispersion, just as a prism separates\n white light into its component colors, the plasma in the magnetosphere separates the radio waves into its component frequencies. Low frequencies are slowed down more than high frequencies. So what started as a pulse ends up as a whistler and the\n The amount of dispersion tells you how many free electrons that radio wave had to pass through to reach the detector. Now just imagine, we could do something very similar to find all the ionized baryons in the universe. All we would need is a\n bright flash of radio waves somewhere in the distant universe. And as if on cue, in 2007, astronomers found the first fast radio burst, which is just what it sounds like, a very short\n pulse of intense radio waves and it came from the deep universe from other galaxies. Now these pulses can be incredibly powerful I'm talking billions or trillions of times as powerful as the\n Sun but they last for on order of a millisecond. We don't really know what creates them though some people suspect that it's magnetars or neutron stars or some sort of collision between these very powerful massive objects like black holes\n and neutron stars, but for our purposes all we need to know is that those flashes exist and that we can use them to look at their dispersion and figure out how many ionized baryons are between us and the source.\n And this is exactly what one recent paper did in nature. They plotted out the dispersion measure of several of these fast radio bursts versus the redshift of their host galaxy. And what they found was, sure enough,\n And the further out these fast radio bursts were, the more dispersed their signal when it reached the earth. And in fact, using their measurements, they were able to estimate the total baryonic matter that is out there. And that includes all the ionization\n And so this validates what we had been thinking about.\n thinking the whole time. You know what surprised me in making this video? It was realizing just how little of the ordinary matter from the Big Bang ended up in things like stars and galaxies, what I normally consider as the stuff of the universe. No, that's only\n like 10 or 20 percent of all the baryonic matter. So it turns out the formation of these interesting structures is a really inefficient process. But this finding is yet another triumph for science. Those computer simulations run decades ago\n turned out largely to be correct. So everyone involved should be congratulated. But this also highlights for me the difference between scientists and non-scientists. I feel like non-scientists like being right. They like when things turn out the way they were expected.\n But scientists, on the other hand, they want things to work out not the way they expect it. Because that's the way we get clues into what new physics is still out there to be discovered. I guess for now we'll have to be content with being very\n right.\n Christmas present.

Rank these things from smallest at the top to biggest on the bottom. But sometimes you have to ask\n the question no one would bother to in order to figure out what people are actually thinking.\n Science place. I'll say planets are the smallest. I'll say planet might be the top of the line Is the Sun bigger than the moon? It depends on the planet, right? It does but as a general category stars, thin moons, and then there's stars\n Yeah around the planet. The Sun is a star right? You think this one's next? I trust you. We're talking about galaxy bro. We're talking everything. You looking at the galaxy too.\n Okay, I think it's this one and then this one you're right you can wait no unless you believe in the multiverse then you know that you're taking this like Four-dimensional chest level. I think the moon would be bigger now. I mean you think right because like it looks bigger. Yeah\n Is this supposed to be like a science lesson? There's definitely some science to this. We are not astrology majors. So what is a moon? Like how's a moon different from a planet?\n of dust maybe. The way that they come about in astrology and like the I don't know like the meteors. Planets is like human life already exists or potentially can exist. And a planet has its own like I don't know I feel\n I get why some people would think this, because the Earth has an atmosphere while our moon has essentially no atmosphere.\n Titan, Saturn's largest moon actually has a thick atmosphere, while Mercury has no substantial atmosphere. So if having an atmosphere isn't what makes a planet, then what is it? You don't know if the moon has people on it. It could. You think the moon could have\n people on it? There could be moon people we never know. I'm thinking like orbits or something something around there. I think I think natural satellite is the term used so so they you you'll always have moons around a planet you can't see a planet around a moon. How many planets do we know\n of? I don't know. I guess. Let's see. Seven, eight? Seven or nine? Do we have eleven in our solar system? I think a planet has to be a certain size to be considered a planet.\n When Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was hailed the ninth planet.\n it quickly became clear that Pluto was different. The real nail in the coffin came on the 5th of January 2005 when astronomers discovered Eris, an object in the Kuiper belt that's around 30% more massive than Pluto. Similar large objects had\n been discovered and more were likely to follow. So scientists faced a choice, either add a whole bunch more planets or demote Pluto. In 2006 the decision was made and a new definition for a planet was established.\n To be a planet, an object now had to set a\n satisfy three criteria. First, it must orbit the sun. Second, it must have enough self-gravity so that it's round or almost round. And third, it must be gravitationally dominant and cleared out its neighborhood. Pluto satisfies\n first two criteria but not the third. So now we're back to the set of planets without Pluto. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Oh it's eight. Nice! Any name to\n Bonus points! How many planets outside the solar system? Maybe around a couple hundred to a thousand maybe? Probably a couple million. Probably more than that.\n I mean in terms of the number that we know is about 5,000 right now. Oh that have been identified but like there you're right There's many more but we just haven't haven't seen them yet. So we don't know So the moons are the smallest they go around the planets planets go around the stars. What makes a star a star?\n Kind of like a dead planet, right? Like it's just emitting heat. Like little gas things and they explode all the time and we don't even see them. But I don't know where they come from. Can you tell me? If you have a bunch of just like gas as you say like hydrogen, helium,\n and that all kind of clumps together, it forms a star. And then like you say, there's like fusion in the middle of explosions in the middle that are giving out light and heat and stuff like that. Wow, you just taught me something new. I didn't even know that. There you go. Doesn't it take eight Earths to fill the Sun?\n A million Earths. A million Earths. I got it wrong, okay? I'm stupid. No, no, but like it's a lot, right? Here's one way to put this in perspective. In our solar system, there are eight planets, hundreds of moons, millions of asteroids, and more.\n But in terms of mass, all that only makes up 0.14% of the mass of our solar system. The other 99.86% of the mass is the Sun. That is just how much bigger and more massive the Sun is.\n Moon's smallest and planets and stars Well, what is a galaxy like what is that a group of planets in a\n I'd say a certain amount of proximity. Like the solar system, like the system of planets. So like just how we have our solar system is what makes the galaxy. Tons of stars, moons and planets in together makes the galaxy.\n Maybe just a collection of like solar systems? So how many is a collection of solar systems? How big is a galaxy? How many stars? Uh... Help. Wait, I don't know. Own a friend. 60,000. A million?\n I'd say millions. Tens of millions of stars perhaps? How many stars in a galaxy? Roughly. Ballpark. Probably hundreds of millions. Million? Billion? Hundred billion.\n Oh, you are way off! 100 billion? 100 billion stars? Damn! Really? Okay. Number of stars in the galaxy, that can vary depending on the size of the galaxy, but like 100 billion, 200 billion, 300 billion,\n 50 billion like that's like a ballpark with the average is a hundred billion yeah that's crazy right yeah they're huge there's a funny question are there more trees on earth or stars in our galaxy\n Oh, actually, I'm now thinking about like a math problem where it's basically you have to find I guess the whole entire surface area of that. Oh, the answer is I'll save you the trouble.\n more trees on earth than there are stars in the galaxy. You don't have figures you know. So a galaxy is a huge collection of stars, planets, gas, dust, dark matter, and other objects, all bound together by gravity.\n gravity.\n Like all types of vastness, you know supernovas You know, this is a thing that I find nuts and one of the things I wanted to see if people know but like the Milky Way is like one galaxy But it's huge. It's like hundreds\n thousand light years across. That's pretty big. You know what I mean? But then around us, there's nothing. Oh wow. I didn't know that. Basically nothing. Yeah. It's kind of like the continents, right? You have a continent, but then around it, like, there's all this ocean.\n And then there's like more galaxies. And then there's nothing. And then more galaxies. And nothing. More galaxies. Nothing. But this animation is not to scale. Really, it should look more like this. The distances between galaxies are enormous.\n typically millions of light years.\n there in the universe? I'll take a guess and say like 20 something. How many galaxies in the universe? F*** if I know. 12? I don't know. Is it, is that like close? It's more. 20?\n much more oh much more I'm gonna say a hundred more than hundreds thousands more than thousands oh my gosh that's small I mean 10,000 gallons be easy\n galaxies got a hundred billion stars 16,482 hundreds of thousands millions billions 1 billion but is that is that too small 1 billion galaxies each one with a\n 100 billion stars? I'll say 10 billion that we know of. What are you gonna say? The answer is... How many galaxies in the universe? About.\n 100 billion. What? Really? About a hundred billion galaxies. Holy seriously? Yeah. About a hundred billion. Dang. Weird. Oh man. It is huge. A hundred billion are\n observable and those these are just galaxies these are galaxies each galaxy then has about a hundred billion stars Okay, right. That's mind-blowing a little bit, right? Yeah, this is what I'm saying I feel like most people don't know this scale of the universe and that's why I'm out here to talk about that's why\n In fact, there could be even more, because 100 billion galaxies is a conservative estimate. Some believe there are up to 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.\n So it's huge. And between all these galaxies? Nothing. What a wacky universe, right? And around each star there might be on average about six planets. So you can think about 100 billion times 100 billion\n times six roughly and that's conservative okay like the number of planets maybe in the universe so it's insanely huge yes that does sound that is actually wow I feel like\n I feel like it makes me less stressed because it's just a blip in the system man. Nothing's ever that deep. So the universe is insanely huge. And we're incredibly small, I got you. How does that make you feel? Very small. To think about the size of it. Very small.\n I don't know it doesn't make me feel that small. No, there's not still feel pretty big I don't feel big but you know, I still feel like this earth in particular has a pretty decent not a Signific whatever, you know significance. This is a special place\n On the 14th of February 1990, the Voyager 1 spacecraft was about 6 billion kilometers from the sun when it took this picture.

I appreciate it. I like learning. That's awesome. Well, thank you for being open to learning because that's so important. The thing that people are worried about is making mistakes, but you can't learn without making mistakes a lot of times.\n So many people don't know the basics about the universe we live in, but it can even be hard to understand the world we live in. And this has a lot to do with our media ecosystem, which often prioritizes speed over accuracy and since\n The problem that's so big in science communication, I made a whole video about it. But Ground News, the sponsor of this video, changes the game by giving you the tools to consume news in a more nuanced and transparent way.\n It's grounded by a former NASA engineer and it gathers articles from around the world in one spot. So ground news shows how different outlets cover the same story and gives you context about the source of the information. Take a look at this study on America's trust in\n science. I can see that more than 10 articles were published on it. And if I scroll down, I can read them all in one place. Next to each headline, there are tags showing me who owns the outlet, how reliable their reporting is, and if they have a political bias.\n What's interesting is that some headlines just mention a decline in trust, some link it to COVID, and others focus on the trend being worse in minorities. Brown News also gives a biased distribution chart, showing me that this story is mostly covered by\n center-leaning sources with little coverage from the left and none from the right. So for readers living in a right-leaning media bubble, this would be a blind spot. Ground News actually sorts stories like this into a separate feed so you can see what topics both\n of the political spectrum tend to focus on and make sure you're getting the full picture.

            "transcription": "Ever since the invention of nuclear weapons, humanity has almost accidentally destroyed itself many times over. This is a video about just some of those times. It's about nuclear bombs and missiles accidentally detonating.\n It's about hydrogen bombs being lost. And it's about false alarms that could have led to the end of the world. On the 17th of January, 1964,\n In 1896, a B-52 bomber was flying over the coast of Spain. It was carrying four hydrogen bombs, each one 75 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n This was part of a military operation known as Chrome Dome, where bombers flew around the United States and skirted the borders of the Soviet Union with\n hydrogen bombs on board. The thinking was that if the USSR initiated a first strike, the US could rapidly retaliate by having bombers already up in the air and closer to their targets. The flight took off from North Carolina.\n and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, with the plan to fly by the border of the Soviet Union and return home. The plane would be in the air for more than 24 hours. The flight was so long it required two mid-air refuelings.\n But long flights and mid-air refuelings were commonplace. Flights like this happened every day. The first refueling went smoothly. After flying by the Soviet Union and turning around, the plane needed to be refueled again.\n At about 1030 a.m. over the coast of Spain, above the small fishing village of Palamares, the refueling tanker pulled up in front of the B-52. Larry Messinger, the pilot of the bomber, recalled,\n a little bit too fast. There's a procedure they have where the boom operator, if you get in a dangerous position, he calls breakaway, breakaway, breakaway, and you immediately cut the throttles and drive\n The two planes collided. The boom arms\n which held the refueling nozzle hit the B-52, breaking off its left wing. The resulting explosion was big enough that it was witnessed by another B-52 which was flying a kilometer and a half away. All four men on the refueling tank\n tanker, and three of the seven on the B-52 were killed in the accident. The four bombs fell to earth. Each one of them had a yield of 1.1 megatons of TNT, about 75\n times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. A hydrogen bomb gets most of its power from the fusion of tritium and deuterium, which are isotopes of hydrogen with extra neutrons. When these isotopes fuse into helium,\n little bit of mass is lost, which is released as energy. But it takes a tremendous amount of energy to get that reaction started, which is why a hydrogen bomb is actually three bombs in one. A conventional bomb, which when detonated triggers the plutonium\n vision bomb, which then creates high enough temperatures and pressures and releases enough energetic x-rays to trigger the fusion reaction. The conventional explosives in two of the four bombs detonated on impact. Fortunately, to trigger\n the fission reaction, the explosion needs to be symmetrical. But since the conventional explosives detonated on impact with the ground, the shockwave wasn't symmetrical and so the fission and fusion bombs weren't set off.\n Unfortunately, the conventional explosive blew up the plutonium core, contaminating a 2.6 square kilometer area of the Spanish coastline with radioactive material. The area is still contaminated with radioactive atoms to the\n But after the crash, the villagers were told to eat no locally produced food and there was an embargo on it in nearby markets. The third bomb was found intact in a nearby riverbed. But the fourth bomb was missing.\n 29 US Army ships\n were involved in the search, and it still took 81 days for the bomb to finally be located and recovered.\n missing for nearly three months. This is not an isolated incident, it's common enough that the US military has a term for accidents involving nuclear weapons. They call\n them broken arrows. The Pentagon officially lists 32 such accidents between 1950 and 1980. Five of them occurred during Operation Chromedome, cases when a B-52 carrying hydrogen bombs crashed. In 1961,\n In 2001, the first year of Operation Chromedome, a B-52 had a fuel leak and it crashed over North Carolina. Three members of the crew died in the accident. It was carrying two 4-megaton bombs.\n fell to earth. One had its parachute deployed and it landed on the ground, mostly intact. The other slammed into a field and broke into pieces. The good news is that the conventional explosives did not explode, so radioactive\n of plutonium was not strewn all over North Carolina. The bad news is that the conventional explosives didn't explode, and so there was a chance that the hydrogen bombs could be armed and ready to detonate with full force. Recalling the incident 52 years later,\n Lieutenant Jack Revelle, who was responsible for the safe disposal of the bomb, said,\n At the time, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said that the bombs were unarmed and could not have accidentally exploded. But in a report declassified in 2013, it was stated that the bomb\n was armed, a single switch could have triggered the detonation. By the way, the bomb is still there, lodged about 50 meters under the field. After the bomb fell on the field, there was a\n flash flood, which meant that it couldn't be recovered. So to make sure that no one could dig up the bomb, the US military placed a 120 meter diameter slab of concrete over the whole area. According to the Pentagon report, there is no detectable\n radiation and no hazard in the area, but a portion of one weapon containing uranium is missing. There are dozens more events like this, like the plane crash over Greenland in 1968, the four high\n The hydrogen bombs it was carrying burned up in the fire. The decontamination of the surrounding area took four months. That same year, the Soviet K-129 submarine sank in the Pacific Ocean, killing all 98 of its crew.\n It was also carrying three nuclear warheads. Part of the submarine was covertly recovered by the CIA. Another standout incident occurred in 1965 about 100 kilometers off the coast of Japan. A Douglas\n a four jet carrying at least one hydrogen bomb fell off the aircraft carrier during a training exercise. The plane, the bomb, and the pilot were never recovered. So for more than half a century, there has been a one megaton\n hydrogen bomb lying on the sea floor, 4 kilometers below the surface of the ocean. It is one of at least six US nuclear weapons that have been lost and never recovered. In 1998, Alexander Lebed,\n Russia's former chief of national security asserted that there are more than 100 1 kiloton nuclear bombs that are unaccounted for. The most well known broken arrow event happened in September 1980.\n In a made-as-silo in rural Arkansas, a team was conducting routine checks on the Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile. The missile was fueled, ready to launch at a moment's notice. In its nose cone sat a 9-megaton hydrogen bomb.\n As one of the repairmen was walking around the silo, the socket from his ratchet wrench fell off. It fell 24 meters\n hitting the fuel tank of the missile and puncturing a hole. The highly flammable rocket fuel began to leak into the silo. The missile complex and surrounding area were evacuated, but a number of military personnel\n remained on site to try to defuse the situation. At 3am, about 8 and a half\n hours after the puncture of the fuel tank, the leaking fuel vapors ignited, resulting in an explosion. This explosion led to one death and 21 injuries. The 740 ton door keeping the silo sealed flew more than\n 60 meters into the air. It was recovered 200 meters away. The warhead containing the hydrogen bomb was also blown out of the silo, landing some 30 meters away. Luckily, it did not detonate.\n And these are just the near misses that we know about. Of the 32 broken arrow events listed by the Pentagon, one which occurred in the spring of 1968 remains classified. There are likely many dozens more nuclear mistakes and\n near misses the public knows nothing about from every nation that has a nuclear arsenal. The worry of a nuclear mishap is not just the immediate damage done by a hydrogen bomb explosion, it's also the misunderstanding\n and retaliatory strikes that could arise. Imagine that in 1966, instead of hydrogen bombs falling off the coast of Spain, the plane crash occurred closer to the border with the Soviet Union. Humanity has been on the brink of nuclear war\n many times, and so far we've been lucky. The closest we've likely ever come was in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The US Navy began dropping signaling charges into the water to bring a Soviet\n Soviet submarine to the surface. But tensions were high and the submarine had not been in radio contact with Moscow for days. The captain of the submarine decided that war had broken out and he was about to launch a nuclear torpedo. But the launch required\n the authorization of three men. Two out of the three authorized the launch, but Vasily Arkhipov did not. A full-blown nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union was avoided by the rational decision of\n one person. The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. later noted that this was not only the most dangerous moment of the Cold War, it was the most dangerous moment in human history. And during the\n Cuban Missile Crisis, with the tensions between the US and USSR at an all-time high, both countries still conducted high-altitude nuclear tests. The US set off a 410-kiloton bomb 50 kilometers above the Pacific Ocean, and a smaller\n 7 kiloton bomb at an altitude of 147 kilometers. Two of the 300 kiloton tests conducted by the Soviets occurred in space. It's pretty hard to justify these actions, but if one of these tests was thought to be a nuclear\n nuclear first strike, leading to all out war. Because false alarms happen for something a lot more innocuous than nuclear tests in space. On the 26th of September 1983, the Soviet satellite based early warning system detected the\n launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Their policy dictated that if any inbound missiles were detected, there was to be an immediate counterattack against the United States. This would have likely led to all out war.\n The Soviet officer on duty at the time of the detection, Stanislav Petrov, was skeptical of the reading. He reasoned that if there was a genuine first strike, the US would launch hundreds of ICBMs simultaneously, not just one. The detection system then warned\n Petrov of another four missiles headed towards the USSR. But these two he dismissed as a glitch. Petrov was right. He made the right decision, and his clear thinking likely saved millions of lives. The warning system malfunctioned.\n it confused sunlight reflecting off high-altitude clouds for ballistic missiles. After this incident, Petrov took an early retirement and later suffered a nervous breakdown. Another close call happened on January 25th,\n 1995, when scientists launched a rocket off the coast of Norway. The rocket was there to study the Northern Lights, but Russian radar picked up this launch as it had a similar flight pattern and speed as the submarine-launched Trident ICBM.\n The incident was serious enough that a briefcase containing the nuclear launch codes was taken to the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin. I think most people believe the biggest threat posed by nuclear weapons is their deliberate use. There is this idea\n that as long as nations only have them and don't use them, they could act as a deterrent keeping us safer. But all of these incidents demonstrate that the real risk of nuclear weapons is some freak accident. So far,\n humanity has been lucky, but how long until our luck runs out? But there is hope. In 1986, there were more than 70,000 nuclear weapons. In 2022, that number had dropped\n to 12,705. And more are being dismantled. But as long as there are any nuclear weapons remaining, the future of humanity is not safe.\n Hey, this part of the video is brought to you by Henson Shaving. Close shaves are bad when it comes to nuclear weapons, but they're great when it comes to shaving. Henson is a company that was started by aerospace machinists\n who wanted to use their experience in precision manufacturing to create a better shaving experience. And honestly, I think they've succeeded. I've been using their AL13 for the past few months, and it's the best shave I've ever had. The Razer\n is made using CNC machines with incredibly tight tolerances, so the blade sticks out just .03mm. This means that the blade is perfectly supported, which reduces chatter, the up and down movement of the blade. This reduction in\n chatter reduces skin irritation. In fact, Henson conducted a test where participants shaved the left part of their face with the multi-blade razor and the right part with the AL-13, and they saw a statistically significant reduction in skin irritation when the Henson\n razor was used. The AL-13 is really high quality and it uses standard double-edged blades which are much less expensive than the proprietary blades sold by other companies. So once you own a Henson razor, the cost of shaving works out to be just three to five\n dollars per year, depending on how often you shave. And because you're not throwing away all that plastic, it's also much better for the environment. So if you'd like to have a better shaving experience while saving money and helping the environment, head on over to\n henshavings.com and enter code VERITASIUM for 100 free blades with the purchase of a razor. I want to thank Henson for sponsoring this part of the video and I want to thank you for watching.\n you"

            "transcription": "What would happen if a star exploded near the Earth? Well, the nearest star to Earth, of course, is the Sun, and it is not going to explode. But if it had eight times the mass, then it would go supernova at the end of its life.\n life. So what would that look like? Well, as noted by XKCD, if you held up a hydrogen bomb right to your eyeball and detonated it, that explosion would still be a billion times less bright\n than watching the sun go supernova from earth. That's how insanely powerful supernova explosions are. They are the biggest explosions in the universe. When we see supernovae in other galaxies,\n On the 8th of October 1604, the astronomer Johannes Kepler\n looked up into the night sky and noticed a bright star he had never seen before. It was brighter than all the other stars in the sky, and about as bright as the planet Jupiter. On moonless nights, it was bright enough to cast a shadow.\n Kepler published his observations of this star in a book called De Stella Nova, which means about a new star in Latin. Kepler thought he was witnessing the birth of a new star, but it was actually a star that was born.\n stars' violent death. Over the following year and a half, the light faded until it was no longer visible. But the name stuck. Even once we learned what was really happening in the 1930s, the violent final explosion for\n stars between about 8 and 30 solar masses has been called a supernova. But how exactly a star explodes is not what most people think. For most of a star's life, it exists in a stable\n balance. In its core, it fuses lighter elements together to make heavier ones, and in the process, it converts a small amount of matter into energy. This energy is really what keeps the star from collapsing in on itself.\n the star, but that force is counteracted by the pressure generated by the movement of particles inside the star, and by the pressure of photons released by fusion. So, in effect, stars are propped up by the\n their own light. If the rate of fusion drops at the center of the star, the temperature and pressure decrease, gravity starts winning, compressing the star. But this increases the temperature and pressure in the core, which\n increases the rate of fusion. It's a stable, self-regulating system. But there's a problem. Stars have a finite amount of fuel, which over time gets used up. Our sun is about 5 billion years into its 10 billion\n in your lifespan. There are stars dozens of times more massive than the sun, which you would think would live much longer. But they actually use up their nuclear fuel faster. A star 20 times the mass of our sun has a lifespan of just\n 10 million years, and more massive stars burn hotter and even brighter, but for much shorter lives. For 90% the life of a star, the core is only hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium.\n Hydrogen runs out, fusion slows, gravity compresses the core, and its temperature increases to 200 million degrees, at which point helium fuses into carbon. There's enough helium to power the star for around a million years.\n But as the helium runs out, the core is again compressed and heated. Carbon starts fusing into neon, which lasts about a thousand years, and then neon fuses into oxygen for a few more years, then oxygen to silicon for a few months,\n and at 2.5 billion degrees, silicon fuses into nickel, which decays into iron. Now at the heart of this giant star, there is an iron core building that's only a few thousand kilometers across.\n Iron is where this pattern stops. Instead of liberating energy as it fuses into heavier elements, it actually requires energy. Iron is the most stable element, so it actually takes energy both to fuse it into heavier\n elements and to break it down into lighter ones. Both fusion and fission reactions ultimately end up at iron. The iron core grows but the crush of gravity becomes greater and greater as the rate of fusion drops.\n When the iron core is about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun, which is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, the pull of gravity is so strong that something totally wild happens. Quantum mechanics takes over. Electrons run out of\n room to move and they're forced into their lowest energy states. They then become absorbed by the protons in the nucleus. In this process, the protons turn into neutrons and release neutrinos.\n With the electrons gone, the core collapses, and fast, at about 25% the speed of light. So what used to be a ball of iron 3000 kilometers in diameter, becomes a ball of neutrons, just 30 kilometers across.\n cross. Essentially, it's a neutron star. With no outward pressure to hold it up, the rest of the star caves in, also falling at a quarter of the speed of light. It hits the neutron star and bounces off, creating a huge\n huge pressure wave. But this kinetic energy isn't quite enough to start a supernova explosion. No, the thing that really kicks it off is the humble neutrino. Now, I normally think of neutrinos as particles that do basically nothing.\n I mean, they interact so rarely with matter that right now, there are 100 trillion neutrinos passing through your body per second. It would take a light year of lead just to give you a 50-50 chance of stopping a neutrino. And that's because they\n interact only through gravity and the weak force. But in a supernova, when the electrons are captured by the protons, an unbelievable number of neutrinos is released, around 10 to the 58. You would think they would just fly off.\n at nearly the speed of light, but the core of a supernova is incredibly dense, about 10 trillion times more dense than lead. And as a result, it traps some of those neutrinos and captures their energy.\n And this is what makes a star go supernova. A particle that is millions of times less massive than an electron, that barely interacts with anything, is responsible for some of the largest explosions in the universe.\n In that explosion, only a hundredth of one percent of the energy is released as electromagnetic radiation, the light that we can see. Even then, supernovae have enough energy to outshine a whole galaxy.\n About 1% of the energy is released as the kinetic energy of the exploding matter, but the vast majority of the energy is released in the form of neutrinos. And neutrinos are actually the first signal we detect.\n from supernovae. And that's because after they're generated in the core, they can escape before the shockwave reaches the surface, where the light that we see is generated. So neutrinos can arrive on Earth hours before the photons,\n giving astronomers a chance to aim their telescopes at the right part of\n Now, I need to clarify a couple things.\n First, not all really massive stars explode. As they collapse, some form black holes instead, which means they do not go supernova. And second, there's another way to make a supernova, sometimes a white dwarf star, which is\n incredibly dense pulls matter off a nearby star. And when its mass reaches that Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses, the white dwarf collapses, creating a supernova. This is actually the type of supernova that Kepler saw in 1604.\n a supernova 20,000 light years from Earth. Now because the shocks are asymmetric, supernovae explain neutron stars that can move really fast. There's a neutron star we've observed with a velocity of 1000\n 600 kilometers per second, and we think that was caused by a very asymmetric supernova explosion, sent it shooting off in the other direction. Despite only recently learning about how supernovae work, humans have been observing\n them for thousands of years. Ancient Indian, Chinese, Arabic, and European astronomers all observed supernovae. But they are quite rare. In a galaxy like our Milky Way, consisting of 100 billion stars,\n there are only about one or two supernovae per century. A particularly amazing example is the supernova of 1054, when the light of a supernova 6500 light years away reached the earth and was recorded\n by Chinese astronomers. If we look to where that supernova was recorded, we see the Crab Nebula. It is a giant remnant of radioactive matter left behind by the explosion. In the thousand years since\n Since the explosion, the remnant has grown to 11 light years in diameter. Supernovas produce a lot of cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are actually particles, mainly protons and helium nuclei, and they travel out at\n very very nearly the speed of light, have a tremendous amount of energy. So at what distance could a supernova cause problems for life on Earth? The closest stars to us besides the Sun are the three stars in Alpha Centauri.\n They are 4.4 light years away. But stars do move around, and on average a star gets within one light year of Earth every 500,000 years. So what would happen if such a star went off?\n Yeah, so within a light year, you're easily within a danger distance from just the kinetic energy. So I think even at that distance, you're looking at possibly blowing the atmosphere off. But we would also have other\n Supernovae create conditions that are hot enough to fuse elements heavier than iron. In the months after the explosion, these elements undergo radioactive decay, producing gamma rays and cosmic rays. Less than 0.1% of the atomic mass of the atomic bomb is produced by the atomic bomb itself.\n 1% of the energy produced by a supernova is emitted as gamma rays from these radioactive decays, but even this tiny percentage can be dangerous. At a few light years from a supernova, the radiation could be deadly, though most of it would\n be blocked by our atmosphere. Now the earth is protected from solar and cosmic radiation by our atmosphere and specifically by ozone molecules, three oxygen atoms bonded together, but high energy\n cosmic rays from supernovae can come down and break apart nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere and then these bond with oxygen atoms which can then break apart ozone and so we can\n lose a lot of our ozone if there's too many cosmic rays coming from supernova events and that can expose us to all kinds of dangerous radiation coming in from space. We actually see an increase in atmospheric NO3 concentrations coinciding with supernova exposure.\n A supernova within 30 light years is rare, only happening maybe once every 1.5 billion years or so. But a recent article suggests supernovae could be lethal all the way out to 150 light years away.\n And so those would be much more common. We actually have evidence for a supernova that went off 150 light-years from Earth 2.6 million years ago. It would have been seen by our early human ancestors like Australopithecus, and we know this.\n this\n Iron 60 is an isotope of iron, with four more neutrons than the most common type of iron. Iron 60 is really hard to make. Our sun doesn't make it, nor is it produced basically anywhere else in the solar system.\n Iron 60 is made basically exclusively in supernova explosions and iron 60 is Radioactive it has a half-life of 2.6 million years. So every 2.6 million years half of the sample decays into carbon\n Cobalt 60. So, all of the Iron 60 that was around during the formation of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago has definitely decayed. So the Iron 60 that the scientists measure is proof of a recent supernova. Scientists also measure\n The supernova that happened 2.6 million years ago wasn't catastrophic for our\n But some researchers hypothesized that it could be related to the mass extinction which is seen at the Pliocene-Plistocene boundary in the fossil record around the same time. This extinction wiped out around a third of marine megafauna.\n The idea is that the cosmic rays from the supernova hit particles in our atmosphere, creating muons, which are charged particles like the electron only more than 200 times heavier. The muon flux for years after the supernova would have been\n been 150 times higher than normal. And the bigger the animal, the larger the radiation dose it would have received from these muons, which is why megafauna were so disproportionately affected. And what's more, the animals\n Further evidence for these recent nearby supernovae comes from our place in the galaxy.\n You know, if you look in the space between the stars in our galaxy, on average there are around a million hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. That may sound like a lot, but it's basically a perfect vacuum. But for hundreds of light years in all directions,\n around our solar system, you find there are a thousand times fewer hydrogen atoms. It's like they've all been blown out somewhere and our solar system is existing in this cosmic void inside a low density\n But there are cosmic explosions that are even more deadly than normal supernovae. Gamma ray bursts.\n Gamma ray bursts were discovered by the Vela satellites, which were looking for Soviet nuclear tests. But on the 2nd of July, 1967, the satellites detected a large burst of gamma rays which were coming from space.\n main sources of gamma ray bursts, mergers of neutron stars, and the core collapses of gigantic stars called hypernovae. Hypernovae are caused by stars that are at least 30 solar masses and rapidly spinning. Their collapse\n leads to an explosion 10 times more powerful than a regular supernova, and it leaves behind a black hole. The gamma ray bursts caused by hypernovae channel most of their energy into beams which are just a few degrees\n across. If there was a gamma ray burst within 6000 light years, it would decrease the ozone level enough that it could be catastrophic. To put this distance in context, a sphere with a radius of 6000 light years\n contains hundreds of millions of stars. On October 9th, 2022, astronomers detected one of the most powerful gamma ray bursts ever measured. It was powerful enough to measurably affect how the ionosphere bounces radio waves.\n The effect on the ionosphere was around the same as a solar flare. But this gamma ray burst was located in a galaxy two and a half billion light years away. Astronomers speculate that a gamma ray burst could have caused\n caused the late Ordovician mass extinction, which wiped out 85% of marine species 440 million years ago. There is no direct evidence, but gamma ray bursts are common enough that it is estimated that there has been a 50%\n So if a supernova or a gamma ray burst were to go off near the earth now, that would be pretty catastrophic.\n But in an ironic twist, we kind of owe our existence to these sorts of explosions, because 4.6 billion years ago, it was probably the shockwave from a nearby supernova which triggered the collapse\n of a cloud of gas and dust that gradually coalesced to form our solar system. So the Sun, the Earth, and all of us wouldn't be here today without the explosions of nearby stars.\n Figuring out how supernova explode was incredibly difficult. It took a combination of astrophysics, particle physics, computer science, and mathematics.\n And if you want to develop a better understanding of our universe, then you should check out the sponsor of this video, Brilliant.

            "transcription": "A plane plummets out of the sky. A speedrunner inexplicably jumps to a higher platform. And an election recount is triggered, all because of the same invisible phenomenon\n that permeates the universe. On May 18th, 2003, voters in Belgium went to the polls. In many regions, voting was done on a computer, something the Belgians had been experimenting with for over a decade. But the system\n had a backup. Each voter would insert a magnetic card into the machine and make their selection on screen. Their vote was saved both to the computer and the magnetic card which they dropped into a box for redundancy. Late that night,\n As the votes were being tabulated, one of the election officials detected a problem with the results from Scarbeck, a municipality in central Brussels. Maria Vinde Vogel, a little-known candidate with her own party, received more votes than was mathematically correct.\n mathematically possible. They knew this because of the way the preferential voting system works. So they took out the magnetic cards and started a recount. One by one, they fed each of them through the machines again. And after several hours,\n the recount was complete. The vote totals for every candidate were exactly the same as before, except for Maria Vindavogel. In her case, the recounted number of votes was less than the original by 4,000 votes.\n So what went wrong? How had her original tally been inflated by over 4,000 votes? Computer experts were brought in to run extensive tests on the software. They combed through the code but could find\n no bugs. They got the computer that had made the initial erroneous tally and tested the hardware again and again, but they could not replicate the error. Everything about the hardware seemed to be in perfect working order, and this left only one\n Impossible explanation and it is seriously weird. The clue comes from the excess number of votes Vindavogel received. 4096. Computers work using binary, strings of zeros and ones\n each corresponding to a power of 2. So somewhere inside the computer tabulating all the votes was a string of bits representing the number of votes Maria received. It started the day all zeros, and then as each vote for her came in, it would increment by one.\n Physically, this is done by turning on a transistor for 1 and turning it off for 0. What's remarkable about the number 4096 is that it is exactly a power of 2, 2 to the power of 12.\n That is the 13th bit. So for Maria Vindavogel to receive an extra 4,096 votes, only one thing needed to happen. The 13th bit had to flip from a 0 to a 1.\n But why would that happen? Computers work precisely because bits don't flip unless we want them to. Or do they? Looking into the problem, Belgian investigators found reports of similar issues from\n big computer companies starting in the 1970s. In 1978, Intel reported some strange errors popping up in their 16 kilobit Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM. Ones would spontaneously flip\n to zeros with no apparent cause. The problem turned out to be the ceramic packaging the chip was encased in. With the demand for semiconductor packaging skyrocketing in the 1970s, a new manufacturing plant was constructed on the green\n Unfortunately, this site happened to be just downstream of an old uranium mill. Radioactive atoms made their way into the river and then into the ceramic packaging for Intel's microchips. Intel signed a contract with the company to make the site a nuclear power plant.\n Scientists investigating the problem found that even trace amounts of uranium and thorium in the ceramic were sufficient to cause problems. In their DRAM, memory was stored as the presence or absence of electrons in a semiconductor well.\n particles emitted by uranium and thorium were energetic and ionizing enough to create electron hole pairs in the silicon. If an alpha particle struck in just the right place, it could create a large number of free charge carriers, causing electrons to\n accumulate in the well, flipping a 1 to a 0. This is known as a single event upset, a type of soft error. The error is soft because the device hasn't been damaged. The bit has changed, but you could erase it and\n rewrite it with no problems. Investigators exposed the chips to alpha emitters with different levels of activity, and just as you'd expect, they found the number of bit flips directly correlated with the number of alpha particles the chip had been exposed to. The reason this\n This problem was identified in the 1970s was because chip components had been miniaturized to the point where a single alpha particle could produce enough charge to flip a bit. Immediately, these findings attracted a lot of attention.\n published, it was widely circulated in the industry. And as a result, chip manufacturers were a lot more careful to avoid radioactive materials when producing their microchips and packaging. Therefore, the bit flip that gave Maria Vindavogel 4099\n extra votes wasn't caused by natural radioactivity in the computer. So where did it come from? After Henri Becquerel discovered radioactivity with uranium in 1896, scientists sought a way to measure it.\n How radioactive were different materials? And one way to do this is with a gold leaf electrometer. When it's charged, the leaf is repelled and you can measure the amount of charge by the angle of the leaf. Now if ionizing radiation\n When radiation enters the chamber, it rips electrons off air molecules, creating positive and negative charges. Opposite charges are attracted to the leaf, discharging it over time. The higher the level of ionizing radiation, the faster the device\n discharges. In 1910, Theodore Wolf took his electrometer to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Since radioactivity was found in the soil and rocks of Earth, he expected that 300 meters up, the radiation would be just a few percent of the\n radiation. Instead, he found only a slight decrease. In 1911, Austrian physicist Victor Hess decided to take this experiment further. Literally. He loaded electroscopes into the basket of a hydrogen\n balloon. In his first two flights, he observed the same thing as Wolf. Up to an altitude of 1,100 meters, both trips revealed no fundamental change in radiation compared to the values observed on the ground. But the next year, he conducted\n seven balloon flights up to an altitude of 5200 meters. And here, he discovered something remarkable. While there was an initial drop in radiation for the first several hundred meters, above one kilometer or so,\n the level increased with increasing altitude. At his maximum height, the level of radiation was several times greater than it was on the ground. The radiation appeared to be coming not from the Earth,\n but from the sky. Hess scheduled one of his balloon flights during a solar eclipse, and as the moon passed in front of the sun, he carefully watched his instruments. But the readings were unaffected. Even with the sun\n half covered, the level of radiation was the same. Since no influence of the eclipse on the penetrating radiation was noted, we conclude that even if a part of the radiation should be of cosmic origin, it hardly emanates from the sun.\n Victor Hess had discovered cosmic rays, high energy radiation from space. But what were these rays exactly and where were they coming from? Well today we know they aren't electromagnetic rays as many suspect.\n but particles. Around 90% are protons, 9% are helium nuclei, and 1% are heavier nuclei. Some of them are from the Sun, but they have comparatively low energy. High energy causes\n And the highest energy particles are thought to come from black holes, including the super\n massive black holes at the centers of galaxies. But it's hard to pin down exactly where cosmic rays come from because as charged particles they're deflected by magnetic fields in space. So they can wind their way through the universe for billions\n of years. A cosmic ray detected on October 15th 1991 had an energy of 51 joules. That is a single subatomic particle with the energy of a baseball going a hundred kilometers\n But primary cosmic rays like these don't make it down to Earth's surface. Instead, they collide with air molecules around 25 kilometers above the ground and create new particles.\n particles like pions. These collide and decay into other particles like neutrons, protons, muons, electrons, positrons, and photons, which in turn collide with other air molecules in one long cascade.\n So from a single primary cosmic ray comes a shower of particles streaming towards the earth. It is one of these particles that investigators suspect struck a transistor in a computer in Belgium flipping the 13\n bit from a zero to a one and giving Maria Vindavogel 4096 extra votes. But how often do things like this happen? In 1911 Charles Wilson made it possible to see the cosmic\n rays all around us when he perfected his cloud chamber. An enclosure with super saturated water or alcohol vapor. When a cosmic ray passes through the chamber, it ionizes the gas, causing vapor to condense into tiny droplets on the ions.\n revealing the path of the particle. Alpha particles, helium nuclei, leave short, thick tracks, while beta particles, electrons, leave long, skinny trails. In 1932, Carl Anderson identified a trail that looked like a\n was made by an electron, but in the applied magnetic field it curved in the wrong direction, implying it had a positive charge. Anderson had found the anti-electron, or positron. It was the first confirmed sighting\n of antimatter. Four years later, also using a cloud chamber, he discovered the muon, again in cosmic rays. For his discovery of the positron, Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. He shared the\n the prize with Victor Hess, the man who discovered cosmic rays in the first place, invisible particles that affect our lives in ways most of us are oblivious to. This is possibly the rarest thing to\n ever happen in a video game. In 2013, user dotaTBag was speedrunning Super Mario 64 on the console. In the level TikTok Clock, he suddenly upwarps onto a higher platform.\n The move shaves off a few seconds and it seems like a newly discovered glitch in the game that could give speedrunners an edge. User Panandcook12 put out a\n $1000 bounty for anyone who could replicate the upwarp. But so far, after 6 years, no one has been able to. The best explanation anyone can come up with is that a cosmic ray caused the glitch. It's been shown that a\n This single bit flip in the first byte of Mario's height coordinate could have caused the effect. On the main level, the byte was 11000101, but if you flip the last one to a zero, it changes his vertical position.\n And just by chance, this new height coincides with the higher floor. Pannenkoek12 wrote a script to manually flip the bit at the right moment and was able to achieve the same upwarp. This is a particularly visible bit.\n bit flip. But the truth is, cosmic rays are triggering bit flips all the time.\n These days, there are a number of ways computer chips are made resilient in the face of bit flips, like error correction code or E-file.\n But you can't totally prevent bit flips from happening. In 1996, IBM estimated that for each 256 megabytes of RAM, one bit flip occurs per month. The main culprit seems to be neutrons creating a bit flip.\n created in the shower of particles from cosmic rays. Starting in 2009, Toyota recalled millions of vehicles due to the problem of unintended acceleration.\n was continuing to accelerate and he couldn't bring it to a stop. Many speculated that cosmic ray induced bit flips in the electronic control system were the cause. So much so that NASA was called in to help with the investigation. But it turns out cosmic\n cosmic rays were probably not the culprit. NASA identified as the main causes sticky accelerator pedals, poorly fitted floor mats, and most commonly, drivers pushing on the accelerator thinking it was the brake.\n But cosmic rays have caused crashes of supercomputers, especially at higher elevations Los Alamos National Labs located 2200 meters above sea level is constantly dealing with neutron induced supercomputer crashes\n So the software auto saves frequently and neutron detectors have been installed throughout the facility. If you go even higher, like climbing up to cruising altitude in a plane, you can see the radiation from cosmic rays increasing on a Geiger counter.\n counter to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet, up to 1 microsievert per hour at 23,000 feet, over 2 microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet, and over 3 microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles.\n At cruising altitude, this increases the chance of a single event upset by 10 to 30 times. This isn't critical if it happens in your laptop, but what if it occurs in the flight computer? On October 7th, 2008, an air\n Airbus A330 took off from Singapore to Perth. Just over three hours into the flight, the plane suddenly pitched down, diving 200 meters in 20 seconds. Inside the plane, everyone experienced negative 0.8 Gs.\n of acceleration. It would have felt like the plane had flipped over. Minutes later, the plane\n dropped another 120 meters. 119 people on board were injured, many from bumping their heads into the ceiling, so the pilots decided to make an emergency landing in Learmonth. In the investigation that followed, the\n This result seemed to occur with the first Air Data Inertial Reference Unit, or ADARU for short. This computer supplies critical data like airspeed, angle of attack, and altitude. The way it supplies each of these pieces of information is in a\n 32-bit binary word. The first 8 bits identify the type of information, and bits 11 to 29 encode the actual data. What seems to have happened is that a bit flip in the first 8 bits meant alt\n The altitude information was mislabeled as angle of attack information. Inside the cockpit, alarms went on for overspeed and stall simultaneously, something that should be impossible. But the plane nose down sharply to correct what it thought.\n Investigators looked into software bugs, software corruption, a hardware fail, physical environment factors, and electromagnetic interference.\n But each of these possibilities was found to be unlikely based on multiple sources of evidence. The other potential triggering event was a single event effect resulting from a high-energy atmospheric particle striking one of the integrated circuits within the sea.\n One of the challenges with single event upsets is that they are soft errors. They don't leave a trace. But interestingly, the Airbus A330 was built in 1992 when there were no specific regulatory or aircraft manufacturers.\n requirements for airborne systems to be resilient to single event effects. With the space shuttle, redundancy was built in from the start. For navigation and control, there were four computers simultaneously running identical software.\n If one computer had a soft error, the other three would overrule it. Using this setup, they could also track the frequency of bit flips. On one five-day mission, STS-48, there were 161 separate bit flips.\n flips. Above the atmosphere, cosmic rays are so energetic, sometimes you can even see them.\n you occasionally will see a flash of light. And we think it is heavy particles or individual bursts of energy coming from radiation that are either going through the eyeball itself or going through the optic nerve.\n And the way that your body registers, radiation going through it is amazingly enough by showing you a little flash in one of your eyes just to remind you that you are subject to the radiation of not only our sun but every star\n of the universe that is radiating at you. I picture back to the first astronauts who must have closed their eyes and seen that radiation and gone, I'm not going to tell anybody about this because no one's told me about it. I can just imagine the first\n For missions to other planets, protecting electronics is critical.\n If a single bit of information controls a critical function on your spacecraft, let's say your thrusters, and that goes from a one to a zero from a on to off or vice versa, you could lose the mission. That's why the computer on the Perseverance rover,\n that just landed on Mars is 20 years old. It's a power PC launched in 2001 with only 256 megabytes of RAM and 2 gigabytes of flash storage, but it is radiation hardened, meaning the\n Design, materials, circuits and software are built to withstand 40 times the radiation of an ordinary computer. It's been used on over a dozen space missions going back to 2005.\n power PC testing years ago. The way we did it, we just simply stuck an operating system processor in a beam line where we generate these particles on the planet and look for blue screens of death. You can\n As the Voyager 1 spacecraft departed the solar system, one of the ways we could tell was\n by an increase in the flux of cosmic rays it experienced. Although on Earth, the particles streaming from the sun and the solar wind are a source of radiation, further out, these same particles maintain a protective bubble, the heliosphere.\n It helps deflect and slow cosmic rays from interstellar space, protecting the solar system from ionizing radiation. But the Sun has an 11-year activity cycle, so this protection fluctuates. The flux of cosmic rays\n on Earth is much lower when the sun is active than when it's dormant. In the history of our planet, cosmic rays may have played an even larger role, flipping bits not in electronics, but in the genetic code\n Maria Vinde Vogel is now a member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, elected by people, not a particle.\n But her story is a reminder of the zillions of particles winding their way through the universe for millions or billions of years.

For his discovery of the positron, Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. He shared the\n the prize with Victor Hess, the man who discovered cosmic rays in the first place, invisible particles that affect our lives in ways most of us are oblivious to. This is possibly the rarest thing to\n ever happen in a video game. In 2013, user dotaTBag was speedrunning Super Mario 64 on the console. In the level TikTok Clock, he suddenly upwarps onto a higher platform.\n The move shaves off a few seconds and it seems like a newly discovered glitch in the game that could give speedrunners an edge. User Panandcook12 put out a\n $1000 bounty for anyone who could replicate the upwarp. But so far, after 6 years, no one has been able to. The best explanation anyone can come up with is that a cosmic ray caused the glitch. It's been shown that a\n This single bit flip in the first byte of Mario's height coordinate could have caused the effect. On the main level, the byte was 11000101, but if you flip the last one to a zero, it changes his vertical position.\n And just by chance, this new height coincides with the higher floor. Pannenkoek12 wrote a script to manually flip the bit at the right moment and was able to achieve the same upwarp. This is a particularly visible bit.\n bit flip. But the truth is, cosmic rays are triggering bit flips all the time.\n These days, there are a number of ways computer chips are made resilient in the face of bit flips, like error correction code or E-file.\n But you can't totally prevent bit flips from happening. In 1996, IBM estimated that for each 256 megabytes of RAM, one bit flip occurs per month. The main culprit seems to be neutrons creating a bit flip.\n created in the shower of particles from cosmic rays. Starting in 2009, Toyota recalled millions of vehicles due to the problem of unintended acceleration.\n was continuing to accelerate and he couldn't bring it to a stop. Many speculated that cosmic ray induced bit flips in the electronic control system were the cause. So much so that NASA was called in to help with the investigation. But it turns out cosmic\n cosmic rays were probably not the culprit. NASA identified as the main causes sticky accelerator pedals, poorly fitted floor mats, and most commonly, drivers pushing on the accelerator thinking it was the brake.\n But cosmic rays have caused crashes of supercomputers, especially at higher elevations Los Alamos National Labs located 2200 meters above sea level is constantly dealing with neutron induced supercomputer crashes\n So the software auto saves frequently and neutron detectors have been installed throughout the facility. If you go even higher, like climbing up to cruising altitude in a plane, you can see the radiation from cosmic rays increasing on a Geiger counter.\n counter to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet, up to 1 microsievert per hour at 23,000 feet, over 2 microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet, and over 3 microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles.\n At cruising altitude, this increases the chance of a single event upset by 10 to 30 times. This isn't critical if it happens in your laptop, but what if it occurs in the flight computer? On October 7th, 2008, an air\n Airbus A330 took off from Singapore to Perth. Just over three hours into the flight, the plane suddenly pitched down, diving 200 meters in 20 seconds. Inside the plane, everyone experienced negative 0.8 Gs.\n of acceleration. It would have felt like the plane had flipped over. Minutes later, the plane\n dropped another 120 meters. 119 people on board were injured, many from bumping their heads into the ceiling, so the pilots decided to make an emergency landing in Learmonth. In the investigation that followed, the\n This result seemed to occur with the first Air Data Inertial Reference Unit, or ADARU for short. This computer supplies critical data like airspeed, angle of attack, and altitude. The way it supplies each of these pieces of information is in a\n 32-bit binary word. The first 8 bits identify the type of information, and bits 11 to 29 encode the actual data. What seems to have happened is that a bit flip in the first 8 bits meant alt\n The altitude information was mislabeled as angle of attack information. Inside the cockpit, alarms went on for overspeed and stall simultaneously, something that should be impossible. But the plane nose down sharply to correct what it thought.\n Investigators looked into software bugs, software corruption, a hardware fail, physical environment factors, and electromagnetic interference.\n But each of these possibilities was found to be unlikely based on multiple sources of evidence. The other potential triggering event was a single event effect resulting from a high-energy atmospheric particle striking one of the integrated circuits within the sea.\n One of the challenges with single event upsets is that they are soft errors. They don't leave a trace. But interestingly, the Airbus A330 was built in 1992 when there were no specific regulatory or aircraft manufacturers.\n requirements for airborne systems to be resilient to single event effects. With the space shuttle, redundancy was built in from the start. For navigation and control, there were four computers simultaneously running identical software.\n If one computer had a soft error, the other three would overrule it. Using this setup, they could also track the frequency of bit flips. On one five-day mission, STS-48, there were 161 separate bit flips.\n flips. Above the atmosphere, cosmic rays are so energetic, sometimes you can even see them.\n you occasionally will see a flash of light. And we think it is heavy particles or individual bursts of energy coming from radiation that are either going through the eyeball itself or going through the optic nerve.\n And the way that your body registers, radiation going through it is amazingly enough by showing you a little flash in one of your eyes just to remind you that you are subject to the radiation of not only our sun but every star\n of the universe that is radiating at you. I picture back to the first astronauts who must have closed their eyes and seen that radiation and gone, I'm not going to tell anybody about this because no one's told me about it.

You can\n As the Voyager 1 spacecraft departed the solar system, one of the ways we could tell was\n by an increase in the flux of cosmic rays it experienced. Although on Earth, the particles streaming from the sun and the solar wind are a source of radiation, further out, these same particles maintain a protective bubble, the heliosphere.\n It helps deflect and slow cosmic rays from interstellar space, protecting the solar system from ionizing radiation. But the Sun has an 11-year activity cycle, so this protection fluctuates. The flux of cosmic rays\n on Earth is much lower when the sun is active than when it's dormant.

            "transcription": "So you think Planet 9 exists with 99.8% probability? Something like that. Yeah, maybe 99. I'll push it higher. 99.9% probability. It's just wishful thinking.\n In the farthest reaches of our solar system, way past Neptune and Pluto, a ninth planet may be lurking. It's predicted to have a mass five times\n that of Earth, and to orbit once every 10,000 years on a highly elliptical inclined orbit. So why do some scientists suspect that such a strange object exists? That's what I've come to Caltech to find out.\n What do you like to do your work? You know, I usually do it wherever. Wherever I have a couple minutes of free time, I just do it. So this is where a lot of it gets done. My name is Konstantin Vatigin. I am a professor of planetary science at\n Caltech and I do all kinds of astrophysicsy planetary studies including stuff about Planet 9. These are variable transformations. I'll tell you where the Planet\n nine boundary lies it's like that so everything to the left of that is all planet nine so I'm here to find out about hidden planets and how to find hidden planets with math okay so how do we do that I mean do you want to start at the beginning of\n this sort of endeavor or or do you want to jump into Planet Nine? Where do you want to start? Well let's actually let's start at the beginning because the beginning it has a has a long and beautiful history to it and its origin dates back to 1781 I believe\n when Uranus was first discovered by Herschel and when Herschel discovered Uranus he immediately realized that the star that was slowly moving across the sky had actually been imaged many many times before. It was\n a matter of going back to old observations and retracing the orbit that Uranus was following on the sky. Astronomers and mathematicians of the time immediately noticed that there was a problem with the orbit of this newly discovered\n planet, it was deviating from where it was supposed to be. But a French mathematician by the name of Urbain Le Verrier eventually did this beautiful and very complicated set of calculations that said, okay, if there is a\n planet is there, in that part of the sky, then we can explain the anomalous motion of Uranus. Once there was a mathematical prediction of where to look, astronomers were then able to\n discover Neptune with basically pinpoint accuracy. How quickly did they find Neptune? So this is a remarkable story. They found Neptune in one night because they knew exactly where to look. There could be a ninth planet.\n There's a lot of space for a ninth planet in the outer solar system, but there's no good evidence for a ninth planet at the present time. And a particularly scary thing about the ninth planet is that a lot of people want to believe that there's a ninth planet.\n And we all know this is huge psychological bias to the effect that if you want to believe something is true, you will find evidence, real or not, that it's true. Everyone and their brother in the last 170 years\n have predicted planets beyond Neptune. But all of these theories have failed to date. I think that we, meaning myself and my collaborator slash partner in crime, Mike Brown, are right.\n Our understanding of the solar system has evolved dramatically in the last 20 years. We've discovered that there exists this one additional belt of icy debris called the Kuiper belt. These are kind of big icy asteroids that are maybe\n the size of LA, floating around beyond Neptune. Who's responsible for finding the Kuiper Belt? I found the Kuiper Belt with my student, Jane Lu. We were looking for a\n anything actually beyond the orbit of Saturn. So the puzzle in 1985, the puzzle was why is it that the inner part of the solar system is full of asteroids and comets and all kinds of things, planets, all this stuff, but then when you go beyond\n Saturn there's Uranus, there's Neptune, and there's Pluto, and then that's it. Why would the outer solar system be so empty? It's a very simple question of the kind that I can understand, and the answer was, well, let's have a look.\n And we said, look, you know, maybe it's not really empty. Maybe it is, in which case that would be interesting, but maybe it's not. So we started a survey to find stuff beyond Saturn. And we did the survey for a long time, five years or something, six years, and found\n nothing for that whole time, including nothing just beyond Saturn where we expected to find stuff until finally in 1992 we got this thing way out and we could tell immediately it's way out 45 AU, 50 AU from the slow motion across\n the sky. We found this thing out there, what we call now the first identified Kuiper Belt object. It's actually the second because Pluto was misidentified back in 1930 for all sorts of reasons connected with sociology and propaganda and\n and things like that. People wanted to find a planet and so no matter what Pluto must be a planet. So that process has continued. We have more than 2,000 of these objects now. So in 25 years 2,000 of these things have been found. We think the population is vast.\n There's a billion things bigger than a kilometer across, maybe more, maybe a couple billion. It's some of the more distant objects that appear to some people to show this orbital alignment. And they have in particular a very large perihelion\n distant so they never come close to the sun they never come close to even Neptune. If you look at the most distant objects in this belt of debris called the Kuiper belt all of their orbits kind of point into the same direction. Is it possible that there are some\n going in the other direction, we just haven't found them. They're there. Yeah, of course. That's a great question. Generically, when you search for objects in the night sky, they're always what are called observational biases. You're always\n We're limited to finding objects only where you look. So this is a key question that you have to ask, right? Is it that we only found objects that are all pointing that way, right? Their orbits pointing that way because we only look there.\n The answer is that there is a chance that this is all a false alarm. And that chance is 1 in 500. There are bodies that occasionally will swing out into other directions. It's more that overall\n If you look at it, there is an overall tendency. So here what we see is a pretty typical kind of simulation of the type that we do. We start the solar system in an initial kind of\n totally random state where all the objects are pointing everywhere. For scale these pink circles here are Uranus and Neptune and this long ellipse, this long pink\n ellipses, planet 9. These blue guys, these blue orbits are long period Kuiper belt objects, the ones that in the real solar system we see the clustering among. And these gold or greenish\n are the more short period, more proximate members of the Kuiper Belt, which are not clustered at all. So it takes a long time, but about two billion years into the evolution of the solar system, you begin to see the fact\n The fact that objects that are collinear with Planet Nine have all been scattered away, removed from the solar system dynamically, and the only kind of remaining members of the distant solar system are the objects that\n point the opposite way. Again, it's a remarkable gravitational signature, gravitational one-way sign, if you will, that something is confining these orbits, keeping them clustered and pulling\n them all into the same plane.\n threshold for acceptance.\n So even though these clusters of asteroid orbits in the Kuiper Belt provide the best evidence for Planet Nine, there's a chance that further Kuiper Belt observations will find different, unclustered orbits. But regardless, there are\n two other solar system mysteries that could be explained by the existence of Planet Nine.\n So why would we have such a strange planet hanging out out there? Yeah, great question. Indeed, none of this is reminiscent of anything solar system, right? If you for a second ignore the period, right, and ask\n yourself about a mass, a mass of five Earth masses. We don't have anything in the solar system that's five Earth masses. We go from one to seventeen when we go from Earth to Neptune. Is it wild? Actually turns out this is the most common type of planet\n in the galaxy that we have discovered around other stars. It may be reversed. The fact that the solar system doesn't host an object which is five Earth masses closer to the Sun is actually kind of weird. Indeed, five Earth\n masses, as it turns out, is kind of a standard outcome of planet formation. There are more wild things out there, and this is really my favorite aspect of the Planet Nine hypothesis. It's the fact that Planet Nine actively\n flips orbits on their side. You should not expect to find objects in the solar system that are flipped on their side and are orbiting the Sun perpendicular to the planets and you should definitely not expect objects that are orbiting\n the solar system the wrong way, so to speak. Yet we find them, right? They exist in the Kuiper Belt. And this has actually been a problem since before Planet Nine was even a thought. Planet Nine has this intriguing\n mode of dynamical evolution that it instills upon distant orbits where it takes them and at the expense of kind of circularizing these distant objects, right, making their orbits less elliptical, flips them upside down and then\n makes them more elliptical again. It's a complicated dynamical evolution and really at a detailed level you have to go to the computer simulations to understand how it works. But the key kind of product of the existence\n of Planet Nine is the expectation that such objects would exist and we see them. And really there isn't another kind of natural mechanism to generate these highly inclined bodies. You know, you have the plane of most of the bodies\n and then some of the bodies out there apparently have their orbits almost tilted up to 90 degrees. Is that just weird or is that stronger evidence for... That's one of the things that they claim to explain with the planet.\n nine hypothesis and that's a good thing in favor of the hypothesis. But again, you know, you need to find the planet to be sure of what's going on. In the region that we have not yet been able to probe because we can't see faint enough,\n We don't know. We don't know. So when do you think we're going to find planet nine? That's a great question. So observing the sky has proven to be an extreme challenge.\n for Planet 9 is extremely extremely difficult. It's just kind of dim enough at the outer parts of its orbit where it can be discovered with current telescopes but everything has to go right. By everything it has to go right.\n I mean, no moon, the atmosphere has to be calm so that the light is not messed up by turbulence. Such nights do come around every year, but they don't come around very often. So since 2017, we've\n had exactly two successful runs, right, successful observational runs where we had sort of a string of nights where we could take pictures of the same part of the sky over and over again. So we are about 20%\n maybe a little bit more now 25% done with the survey that we are carrying out to search for Planet Nine. If things go at this rate it might take about a decade. I think the commencement\n of the LSST telescope which is coming online 2022-23 that's going to help a lot because that's going to first of all discover many more of these objects and we'll be able to refine the theoretical model better.\n And also, just by direct observation, it'll rule out, or it'll either find planet 9 or rule out a big chunk of its orbit. So we could kind of zero in that way a lot more.\n So, it's an iterative process. I would guesstimate a decade or less. So, volumetrically, we've discovered most of the solar system in the last 25 years, something like that. What do you mean volumetrically?\n The volume of the region occupied by the planets is very small, it's 10,000 cubic astronomical units. But as you go further out, you know, the volume of that sphere that encapsulates all the objects that we've been able to observe is just going up dramatically.\n So if you go ten times further out, which we are now just about able to do, you increase the volume that you're looking at by a factor of a thousand. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on. You know, solar system is, to me, an unknown place.\n You know, we fool ourselves to thinking that we know everything about it just because we've only been looking close and we have a lot of data from spacecraft and so on. But the further away you go, the less known it is and the more mysterious it is. And this ninth planet thing is part of that.\n Because essentially when you go far enough away from the sun, there's enough room to hide almost anything you want. It will be so faint you can put almost anything, big planets, small planets, whatever you want. We would not have seen it yet.\n If and when you do find it, who gets to name it? Oh, that's something we don't think about and don't talk about. You don't have a name in the back of your head? Um, the only David Bowie\n Yeah, there was a online petition on change.org to name Planet Nine David Bowie and I thought it was kind of silly initially but then there's this whole David Bowie like mythology that you could create past moons, you could have Ziggy stardom\n and you know Starman all of these things so so you know kind of like I'm not saying that seriously but also it would be kind of remarkable if we had Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and David Bowie\n you\n you"

I mean I'd seen Aurora from on the surface of the earth, but to be amongst\n them to actually directly be part of that interaction between the sun and the atmosphere and the magnetic field all right there visually like a prism or a rainbow or something. That was a real reality check of how it's all related.\n and how the energy of the sun and the protection of the atmosphere and the focus of the magnetic field all work together. It really showed me that this is a system. This is a planetary system. This goes on all the time. Most of the time, though, we just don't see it. But this is going on.\n on constantly, all the time, how all those things work together. From orbit you get that type of perspective. You see the fact that this is a complicated system that is subject to a lot of influences that is going on all the time.\n One of the influences that is affecting Earth itself, of course, is the beings that are living on it. Volcanoes erupting, but also the plant life and the animal life. And over the last hundred years, I mean, gosh, our numbers have\n have rocketed until 7 billion of us are all simultaneously exhaling and eating and turning on our lights in our house and starting up the engines in our cars. Obviously that has an effect on the planet, in amongst all those other things happening. You can see\n some of those effects from space. You can see with your naked eye, if you come across Mexico City or Beijing, the pollution is visible from space. It's like a gray, ugly smear on the surface of the world.\n that is man-made local climate change. If you come across Asia, on my very first flight there was a big inland sea, the Aral Sea.

This is only the second picture of a black hole ever. It was taken by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, the same people who brought you this image of the supermassive black hole at the center\n of galaxy M87. Now their original plan was to image Sagittarius A star first. Since it's in our own galaxy it is 2,000 times closer than M87 star. But it's also over a thousand times\n smaller, so from Earth it appears only slightly larger than M87 star. And there are a number of additional challenges to observing it. First of all, there is a lot of dust and gas between us\n the center of our galaxy, so you can't even see it with visible light. In this video from the European Southern Observatory, we zoom in on our galaxy's core. As we get closer and closer at something\n At this point we have to switch over to infrared light, which can better penetrate the debris, allowing us to see it from Earth. Over the past three decades, we've been able to peer into the heart of the Milky Way and witness\n This is something truly amazing. A collection of stars zipping around on all kinds of eccentric orbits. They go incredibly fast. One of the stars was clocked going 24 million meters per second. That's 8\n All these stars appear to be orbiting something incredibly massive and compact, but this object isn't glowing brightly like a star. If you watch closely, you can see it flicker now and then.\n This is what we believe to be a supermassive black hole. From the motion of the stars around it, we can infer that the black hole's mass is about four million times that of our sun, but all crammed down into a tiny point, the singularity.\n Anything, including light, that comes within a Schwarzschild radius of this point can't escape and ends up in the singularity. So for us to see any radiation from the black hole, it must come from further out than this, usually from superheated\n plasma as it falls in. But for its size, Sagittarius A-star doesn't consume much matter. It's unusually quiet and dark. The supermassive black hole at the center of M87, in contrast, is much more active, gobbling\n up matter from its accretion disk. Plus, since it's over a thousand times bigger, it takes a thousand times longer for objects to orbit it. And that means, from Earth, its appearance over time is more consistent, in contrast to Sagittarius A-star,\n where things can change on the order of minutes. These visualizations are from Luciano Rizzola and colleagues at Goethe University, Frankfurt. But the biggest challenge of all in making an image of either supermassive black hole is that these objects are so\n compact and so far from Earth, in the sky they appear very, very tiny. To get a sense of just how tiny, take the whole sky and divide it into 180 degrees. The Andromeda galaxy spans about\n three degrees. Then divide one degree into 60 arc minutes and one arc minute into 60 arc seconds. Divide an arc second into a hundred.\n into 100 again, and into 100 once more, and this is the size of the black holes on the sky. It's equivalent to taking a picture of a donut on the moon,\n Now there is no optical telescope on earth that could produce such an image so in this video I want to answer two questions. How did they do it and what are we actually looking at? So starting with how did\n make these images of black holes? Well the first thing to know is they weren't made with visible light. They were made using radio waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters. So all the observations were taken by radio telescopes, which essentially look like huge satellites\n satellite dishes. When a source emits radio waves, they travel out radially in all directions. But Earth is so far away that by the time they reach our planet, the wave fronts are almost completely flat and parallel.\n This is known as a plane wave. A radio telescope works by scanning back and forth across the sky. When it is pointed directly at a radio source, it produces a bright spot. That's because all the radio waves travel the same distance\n bounce off the dish and are received at the same time. So they are in phase, meaning peaks line up with peaks and troughs with troughs. They constructively interfere. As the telescope moves past the source, some of the\n Other radio waves now travel farther than others, and therefore they meet up out of phase, destructively interfere, and the intensity of the signal drops to zero. To make a sharp image, you want this drop-off to be as steep as possible.\n So the telescope produces peak intensity only when aimed directly at the source, and then the intensity drops rapidly when the dish is moved just a tiny bit in any direction. There are two ways of achieving this. One is to observe higher frequency radio waves,\n That way, any slight movement of the telescope represents a greater fraction of a wavelength. This causes destructive interference to occur sooner. The other way is to increase the diameter of the telescope. This increases the difference in path length between radio\n waves on opposite sides of the telescope for a given angular adjustment. How narrowly a telescope can identify the source of radio waves is known as its angular resolution. You can think of it as the size of the spot on the sky\n the telescope is sensitive to. It is proportional to wavelength and inversely proportional to the diameter of the telescope. The challenge with making a picture of a black hole is that you're trying to see the structure in a tiny area of the sky.\n Imagine scanning a radio telescope across the center of a black hole. You would want to see the bright spot as the telescope passes over the left edge, and then a dark spot, and then another bright spot as it passes the right edge. The problem is, for any individual\n radio telescope on Earth, the angular resolution is too large. So as it passes over the black hole, it would still be receiving radio waves from the left side as it begins receiving radio waves from the right side. The resolution isn't high enough to tell if\n if there's a ring structure there as we'd expect with a black hole, or if it's just a blob. Observing at shorter wavelengths isn't really an option, because that light is blocked either by our atmosphere or by the matter around the black hole.\n If you want to improve resolution, the only way you can do it is by increasing the diameter of the telescope. But if you actually do the calculation, you find that the telescope you'd need would have to be the size of the Earth in order to see the ring of a black\n hole, which is obviously impossible. But there is a way to do something that's almost as good. You don't need a complete dish the size of the earth, just pieces of it, individual radio telescopes that are separated by\n distances up to the Earth's diameter. As long as you can properly combine the signals from all these distant telescopes, you get the constructive and destructive interference required to achieve the same angular resolution as an Earth-sized disc.\n This technique is called very long baseline interferometry. So the Event Horizon Telescope is not just one telescope, but a global network of radio observatories. All these telescopes observe Sagittarius A star at\n the same time. Unlike a single telescope, you can't bounce all the radio waves to a central receiver and add them up in real time. So instead, each telescope records the signal at its location and the exact time down to the femtosecond.\n petabytes of data are generated. But now that data needs to be brought together. And the fastest way to do it was actually to carry hard drives as hand luggage to centralized locations. Now think about the data we've got. Electronics\n electrical signals and precise timings from a number of radio telescopes around the world. But none of those radio telescopes has enough angular resolution to see the ring of the black hole. So how do you combine that data and get\n detail than any of the inputs? Well, there is additional information in the relative distances between these telescopes and in the time delays between when a wavefront hits one telescope relative to the other.\n Imagine combining the signals from two distant telescopes. Let's say they both received the same wave at the same time, so those waves were coming in phase. Well, then the source must have been located directly between them.\n them. The radio waves would have traveled the same distance to each telescope to arrive at the same time. Except with just two telescopes, that only narrows it down to a line in the sky that is equidistant from both telescopes.\n The source could have been anywhere on that line, and it's actually worse than that. It's possible that the source could be exactly one wavelength closer to one of the telescopes, and that way the radio waves would still arrive perfectly\n in phase. Or the difference could be 2 or 3 or 4 wavelengths, but you get the point. So from one pair of telescopes, the information we get about the source is actually a series of bright and dark fringes.\n Telescopes that are close together produce wide fringes, while those that are far apart produce narrow fringes. So to make an image, you need pairs of telescopes at all different orientations and different distances apart.\n each pair makes a different interference pattern. And then by combining all these patterns, we get an image of the black hole which created them. But now that we have this picture, what exactly\n is it showing us? Well this is how I explained it when the first image of a black hole was released. So here is my mock black hole of science and this sphere represents the event horizon. Once you're inside\n here there is no coming back, not even for light. The radius of the event horizon is known as the Schwartzschild radius. Now if we were just to look at a black hole with nothing around it we would not be able to make an image like this because well it would just\n absorb all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it. But the black hole that they're looking at has matter around it in an accretion disk. In this accretion disk there is dust and gas swirling around here very chaotically\n It's incredibly hot, we're talking millions of degrees, and it's going really fast, a significant fraction of the speed of light. And it's this matter that the black hole feeds off and gets bigger and bigger over time.\n But you'll notice that the accretion disk does not extend all the way into the event horizon. Why is that? Well that's because there is an innermost stable circular orbit and for matter around a non-spinning black hole,\n orbit is at three Schwarzschild radii. Now in all likelihood the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be spinning but for simplicity I'm just considering the non spinning case. You can see my video on spinning black holes\n if you want to find out more about that. So this is the innermost orbit for matter going around the black hole. If it goes inside this orbit it very quickly goes into the center of the black hole and we never hear from it again. But\n But there is something that can orbit closer to the black hole and that is light. Because light has no mass, it can actually orbit at 1.5\n Schwarzschild radii. Now here I'm representing it with a ring but really this could be in any orientation so it's a sphere of photon orbits and if you were standing there of course you could never go there but if you could you could look forward\n and actually see the back of your head because the photons could go around and complete that orbit. Now the photon sphere is an unstable orbit meaning eventually either the photons have to spiral in to the singularity\n or spiral out and head off to infinity. Now the question I want to answer is what does this black quote-unquote shadow in the image correspond to in this picture of what's actually going on around the black hole?\n Is it the event horizon? Are we simply looking at this? Or is it the photon sphere or the innermost stable circular orbit? Well things are complicated and the reason is this black hole warps space-time around it which changes\n the path of light rays so they don't just go in straight lines like we normally imagine that they do. I mean they are going in straight lines but space-time is curved so yeah they go in curves. So the best way to think of this is maybe to imagine parallel light rays\n coming in from the observer and striking this geometry here. Of course if the parallel light rays cross the event horizon we'll never see them again so they're gone that will definitely be a dark region but if a light ray comes in just above the event horizon it too\n will get bent and end up crossing the event horizon it ends up in the black hole. Even a light ray coming in the same distance away as the photon sphere will end up getting warped into the black hole and curving across\n the event horizon. So in order for you to get a parallel ray which does not end up in the black hole you actually have to go out 2.6 radii away. If a light ray comes in 2.6\n six Schwarzschild radii away, it will just graze the photon sphere at its closest approach and then it will go off to infinity. And so the resulting shadow that we get looks like this.\n it is 2.6 times bigger than the event horizon. You say what are we really looking at here? What is this shadow? Well in the center of it is the event horizon. It maps pretty cleanly onto the center of\n this shadow but if you think about it light rays going above or below also end up crossing the event horizon just on the back side so in fact what we get is the whole back side of the event horizon mapped onto\n a ring on this shadow. So looking from our one point in space at the black hole we actually get to see the entirety of the black hole's event horizon. I mean maybe it's silly to talk about seeing it because it's completely black.\n but that really is where the points would map to on this shadow. It gets weirder than that because the light can come in and go around the back and say get absorbed in the front you get another image of the entire horizon next to that.\n another annular ring and then another one after that and another one after that and you get basically infinite images of the event horizon as you approach the edge of this shadow. So what is the first light that we can see? It is those light rays that come in at just such an angle that they graze the\n photon sphere and then end up at our telescopes and they produce a shadow which is 2.6 times the size of the event horizon. So this is roughly what we'd see if we happen to be looking perpendicular to the\n accretion disk, but more likely we will be looking at some sort of random angle to the accretion disk. We may be even looking edge-on and in that case do we see this shadow of the black hole? You might think that we wouldn't.\n But the truth is because of the way the black hole warps space-time and bends light rays, we actually see the back of the accretion disk. The way it works is light rays coming off the accretion disk bend over the top and end up coming to our telescopes.\n So what we end up seeing is something that looks like that. Similarly, light from the bottom of the accretion disc comes underneath, gets bent underneath the black hole and comes towards us like that.\n And this is where we get an image that looks something like the interstellar black hole. It gets even crazier than this because light that comes off the top of the accretion disc here can go around the\n back of the black hole, graze the photon sphere and come out the bottom right here producing a very thin ring underneath the shadow. Similarly light from underneath the accretion disk in the front can go underneath and around the back and come out over the\n top which is why we see this ring of light here. This is what we could see if we were very close to the black hole, something that looks truly spectacular. One other really important effect to consider is that the\n matter in this secretion disk is going very fast, close to the speed of light, and so if it's coming towards us it's going to look much brighter than if it's going away. That's called relativistic beaming or Doppler beaming. And so one side of the secretion disk is going to look much brighter\n brighter than the other and that's why we're going to see a bright spot in our image. So hopefully this gives you an idea of what we're really looking at when we look at an image of a black hole.\n Hey, this video was sponsored by KiwiCo, creator of awesome hands-on projects for kids.

            "transcription": "This Monday, November 26, around noon pacific time, NASA will attempt to land a spacecraft called Insight on Mars. While a lot of previous missions have looked for life, evidence of past life, water, liquid water, and so on, this is the first mission\n dedicated to studying the interior of Mars. InSight will do that from one location. There is no rover, so wherever it touches down is where the science will happen. Now, InSight stands for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations Geodesy\n and heat transport. So let's go through each of these aspects of the mission and discuss the many firsts that will be attempted. InSight is the first Mars mission to use a robotic arm to grasp and place instruments directly on the surface of Mars. Sure, some rovers in the past\n have rolled off their basin onto Martian soil, but this is the first time we're essentially playing the claw game on the surface of another planet. Without real-time feedback of course because of the long time delays. Now one of the instruments that will be placed on the surface will be the first seismometer\n actually on Martian soil. The Viking landers from the 1970s had seismometers on board, but because they weren't placed directly on the surface of Mars, they essentially just measured the wind blowing over the lander. The seismometer will detect earthquakes, or\n Marsquakes and landslides and meteorite impacts. Now do we expect there to be many Marsquakes? Well, we really don't know. Otherwise, what would be the point of the experiment? This is directly relevant to future human exploration of Mars because the frequent\n frequency and intensity of Mars quakes will determine how we build our structures and habitats. But the real goal here will be to use any significant ground motion to figure out what the interior of Mars is like. Like how big is its core? Is it solid or liquid?\n It'll be kind of like trying to figure out the shape and composition of a bell by listening to its ring. Seismic waves travel at different velocities depending on the density, composition, and state of the material they're traveling through. The seismometer should be able to detect ground motions\n smaller than the diameter of a hydrogen atom. They're achieving this with three tiny precision pendulums. Now I don't know how that's actually possible so I'm just taking their word for it, but with such exquisite sensitivity they've designed a\n custom windshield to go over the whole thing preventing the atmosphere from adding noise to the measurements. Another instrument will send radio waves back to Earth and by using the Doppler effect we should be able to measure how Mars's rotation axis is\n wobbling. This will provide more insight into the actual structure of the planet. Think about how a raw egg spins compared to a hard-boiled one. The more wobble we observe, the more liquid there is inside. And by combining these observations with the seismographic data,\n We should be able to figure out the size of Mars' core, what it's made of and whether it's liquid or solid, the thickness and the structure of the crust, and the structure of the mantle and what it's made of. Another first, figuring out how much heat is escaping Mars.\n Mars interior. The first heat probe to be used on Mars will be deployed on its surface and it will burrow nearly 5 meters down into the planet. This is the deepest we have ever dug on any planet besides Earth. In fact, it'll take around\n months to dig that far. The probe is attached to a tether which has 14 temperature sensors along its length to measure the thermal gradient beneath the surface. And it can only dig into soil. If it hits rock, we're in trouble. This instruction\n instrument also has heaters on it so it can warm the ground around it and see how long it takes for that heat to reach the other temperature sensors. Finally, InSight will be the first to use a magnetometer on the surface of Mars. Mars long ago lost its global\n magnetic field but there are still magnetic effects to be measured. As the solar wind strikes Mars upper atmosphere it creates moving ions that produce magnetic fields and the likely metallic core of Mars is proposed to interact with these magnetic fields which will be measured on Mars\n surface. So the magnetometer provides further insight into the nature of Mars core. So what is the whole point of this mission? Well this is straight-up science. The purpose is to better understand how rocky planets like our own form and evolve and\n And Mars offers a unique opportunity to do this because it formed at the same time as Earth from roughly the same stuff. Plus, it's big enough that it probably underwent the same geochemical changes as Earth. But whereas Earth evolved into a lush water world, Mars evolved into\n into a frozen desert. So why is that? I mean beyond the obvious size difference and different distance to the Sun. Perhaps insight can help us find out. But first it has to land on Mars and since less than half of missions to Mars have landed successfully, that's a big question\n And if you want you can tune in and watch the landing live that will only know about four minutes after touchdown if it made it or not I'll put a link to that in the description for me I feel like this is a great mission to understand some fundamental science about planets and\n their formation. And unlike other missions that go to Mars and have to claim some sort of profound life implications, this is about fundamental science and how planets work, which I think is really cool and I'm looking forward to the results.\n The game is a game of the heart.\n you"

            "transcription": "Due to the crazy technological challenges that had to be overcome in order to detect gravitational waves, some people were skeptical that scientists had actually done it, that they'd actually seen gravitational waves from black holes. After all, there was no corroboration.\n After the discovery that's being announced today, there can be no more doubt. Because scientists have detected the merging of two neutron stars 130 million light years away. This is the first ever detection of gravitational waves from in-spiral\n and\n of\n NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope identified a burst of gamma rays. For decades, gamma ray bursts have been thought to come from neutron star mergers, but the evidence has been lacking. To know for sure that these gravitational waves and the gamma ray burst came from the same event\n the key was to locate where in the sky this neutron star merger occurred. Unlike a merger of black holes, neutron stars emit light when they smash together and continue emitting electromagnetic radiation afterwards. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope identified a\n large patch of the sky, roughly the size of 6,000 full moons. Using the European Space Agency's Integral Gamma-ray Satellite, they were able to narrow down that range. Now the gravitational waves detected by LIGO allowed them to identify two long strips in the sky.\n one of which overlapped with the existing search area. Now interestingly Virgo, which is the newest gravitational wave detector which is in Italy, it was online at the time and it should have easily been able to detect these gravitational waves and yet it saw\n almost nothing. That was kind of a key clue because it indicated that the gravitational waves must be coming from one of that detectors blind spots. Every interferometer has some blind spots where if the waves are coming at that angle it's symmetric with respect to the two arms\n and so it just can't be detected. So this helped further narrow the search area down to the size of about 144 full moons. Now within that area around 50 galaxies were identified to be studied with optical telescopes and just 11\n Hours after the initial detection, astronomers located a bright spot in the galaxy NGC 4993. You are seeing here pictures of the light from two neutron stars that merged 130 million years ago. Watch how the color\n and brightness changes in the aftermath of the collision. So what are neutron stars? Well, they're the left over cores of big stars that have exploded. They've gone supernova. Now, those remaining cores are squeezed down by gravity and\n And if they're too big, say larger than two or three solar masses, well they will keep on getting crushed until they collapse in on themselves forever and become a black hole. But if those cores are a little smaller, say 1.1 and 1.6 times the mass of our sun as\n they were in this case. Well, then they get squeezed still and so electrons merge with protons to form neutrons and neutrinos. And the neutrinos take off and the neutrons are left in a really, really densely packed star.\n The only reason the neutrons don't combine with each other is because of a quantum principle, the Pauli exclusion principle that basically says you can't put two of these particles right on top of each other. That's actually the only thing holding that neutron star up.\n two of these neutron stars and they're orbiting each other well then they emit some of their energy as gravitational waves and as they do that they lose energy meaning they spiral in closer to each other and when they get really close a few hundred kilometers\n The gravitational waves become intense, allowing us to detect them hundreds of millions of light years away. The collision of neutron stars creates a kilonova, which spews debris out into space. This is debris that glows,\n allowing us to observe what's been created. And in fact, the new observations with light telescopes have shown that heavy elements like gold, lead, and platinum were made in this event. And that helps us understand where a lot of the heavy elements in our universe come from. In my view, this event\n It really shows us that we're in a new age of astronomy. We can detect gravitational waves, not just from black holes, but now from neutron stars. We can use that information to locate places in the sky where that occurred, and we can validate that with our other\n telescopes looking in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. So now we really have more tools to understand our universe and I just can't wait for the questions that we're going to address next and all of the different things we're going to be able to study as the gravitational wave\n observatories get better and better. It's a phenomenal time to be studying the universe.\n you"

Although it burned up in the atmosphere three months later,\n Many satellites launched since then have not, leaving us with a virtual junkyard orbiting the Earth. Now those debris represent a real threat to the television, communications and GPS satellites, not to mention the astronauts. But luckily,\n The Swiss have a plan to clean up space, so I've come to Lausanne to figure out how they're going to do it. Most of the space junk orbiting Earth is within 2,000 kilometers of the Earth's surface. There are over 22,000 objects\n larger than this softball, and over half a million larger than this marble. Now, all of the orbiting debris is going about 7 to 8 kilometers per second, but since the objects are moving relative to one another, the average speed of a collision is about 10 kilometers per second.\n And an object this size, going 10 kilometers per second, has about the same impact as a mid-sized car going nearly 200 kilometers per hour. That's enough force to destroy any satellite in orbit. As a veteran of four space flights,\n science, Swiss astronaut Claude Nicolier knows the dangers first hand. All of the large debris are tracked by radar. We know the orbit exactly and sometimes we have to do the small change in the orbital characteristics\n of our spaceship, the Space Shuttle, because it was foreseen that next day or two days later we're going to have a close approach with the debris, such that NASA was not feeling too good about\n Fortunately, to date there haven't been any serious collisions with manned spacecraft. But in 2009, a single crash between two satellites added a whopping\n 2,000 new pieces of debris. So the Swiss, determined to do something about the problem, are\n extending their clean country reputation into outer space.\n of two satellites from Switzerland. One of these two satellites is appropriately named SwissCube. SwissCube is a small satellite which you see, this is a one-to-one model, so this is in the right scale.\n So the mission for Clean Space One is a proof of concept that it\n The janitor satellite can be sent into space to grab a piece of space junk, in this case Swiss Cube, and bring it back into the atmosphere where it'll burn up. But to rendezvous with the space junk, the small janitor needs an incredibly efficient engine.\n Working on the challenge is Professor Herbert Shea, an expert in micromechanics. This is your propulsion system. This is our propulsion system. Little silicon micro-machine ships. We use something called electric propulsion, which allows you to\n emit single atoms that are electrically charged and you use an electric field to accelerate them out so you're not burning them, you're emitting your propellant. And that's what many small satellites use, but nothing has been to date been able to make something this small.\n We do 0 to 60 miles an hour in about three days. But laughable as it indeed seems to all of us, because there's no friction in space, or negligible friction, then if we wait six months, we have a huge change in speed.\n how the mission will be done. Once propelled into the correct orbit, the next challenge is to grab the space junk, an object tumbling around uncontrollably without creating more debris. Our idea is to use a very compliant system. Can I think of an\n octopus arm. An octopus arm is very soft but it can grab any strange shape and wrap around it and hold it. And we'll have a grabber that looks in a very, the real one will be more sophisticated, but it looks like this. So it's basically a very, very soft elastomer. I'll turn it on in a minute. You can see how soft it is.\n The idea is this will be rolled up so it doesn't take up much room. We'll have 10 of these in a series. You get into space, you unroll it, and then these things can open when you turn the voltage on. You're able to open this and you turn the voltage off and it wraps around and it holds the satellite.\n Is this going to be a little bit like those games where you're trying to pick up a stuffed toy in the arcade and drop it somewhere? Is it going to be like that? Essentially, yes. Those games can be incredibly frustrating with those little arms. They're built to be frustrating.\n Whereas this, this is built to be, this is built to succeed. Can I ask, has anyone ever successfully gone up and grabbed a piece of space junk and gotten rid of it? To my knowledge, no. It's never been done before.\n I think grabs on Ambitious as it may sound the Swiss know how vast this junkyard is so their ultimate aims are more modest hopefully starting in say 2020 to do a systematic removal of the large debris at the rate of\n five or more per year in order to contain the increase of the debris density in low Earth orbit. Then space will continue becoming accessible. Of course the exposure to the space environment is a wonderful thing.\n I have come all the way from Australia to see it for myself. Welcome to Alaska.\n I'm at a Fairbanks and I'm trying to find the Northern Lights, the Aurora Coriolis."

Seismic waves travel at different velocities depending on the density, composition, and state of the material they're traveling through. The seismometer should be able to detect ground motions\n smaller than the diameter of a hydrogen atom. They're achieving this with three tiny precision pendulums. Now I don't know how that's actually possible so I'm just taking their word for it, but with such exquisite sensitivity they've designed a\n custom windshield to go over the whole thing preventing the atmosphere from adding noise to the measurements. Another instrument will send radio waves back to Earth and by using the Doppler effect we should be able to measure how Mars's rotation axis is\n wobbling. This will provide more insight into the actual structure of the planet. Think about how a raw egg spins compared to a hard-boiled one. The more wobble we observe, the more liquid there is inside. And by combining these observations with the seismographic data,\n We should be able to figure out the size of Mars' core, what it's made of and whether it's liquid or solid, the thickness and the structure of the crust, and the structure of the mantle and what it's made of. Another first, figuring out how much heat is escaping Mars.\n Mars interior. The first heat probe to be used on Mars will be deployed on its surface and it will burrow nearly 5 meters down into the planet. This is the deepest we have ever dug on any planet besides Earth. In fact, it'll take around\n months to dig that far. The probe is attached to a tether which has 14 temperature sensors along its length to measure the thermal gradient beneath the surface. And it can only dig into soil. If it hits rock, we're in trouble. This instruction\n instrument also has heaters on it so it can warm the ground around it and see how long it takes for that heat to reach the other temperature sensors. Finally, InSight will be the first to use a magnetometer on the surface of Mars. Mars long ago lost its global\n magnetic field but there are still magnetic effects to be measured. As the solar wind strikes Mars upper atmosphere it creates moving ions that produce magnetic fields and the likely metallic core of Mars is proposed to interact with these magnetic fields which will be measured on Mars\n surface. So the magnetometer provides further insight into the nature of Mars core. So what is the whole point of this mission? Well this is straight-up science. The purpose is to better understand how rocky planets like our own form and evolve and\n And Mars offers a unique opportunity to do this because it formed at the same time as Earth from roughly the same stuff. Plus, it's big enough that it probably underwent the same geochemical changes as Earth. But whereas Earth evolved into a lush water world, Mars evolved into\n into a frozen desert. So why is that? I mean beyond the obvious size difference and different distance to the Sun. Perhaps insight can help us find out. But first it has to land on Mars and since less than half of missions to Mars have landed successfully, that's a big question\n And if you want you can tune in and watch the landing live that will only know about four minutes after touchdown if it made it or not I'll put a link to that in the description for me I feel like this is a great mission to understand some fundamental science about planets and\n their formation. And unlike other missions that go to Mars and have to claim some sort of profound life implications, this is about fundamental science and how planets work, which I think is really cool and I'm looking forward to the results.\n The game is a game of the heart.\n you"

            "transcription": "On October 4, 1957, the first satellite Sputnik 1 was launched into space. Although it burned up in the atmosphere three months later,\n Many satellites launched since then have not, leaving us with a virtual junkyard orbiting the Earth. Now those debris represent a real threat to the television, communications and GPS satellites, not to mention the astronauts. But luckily,\n The Swiss have a plan to clean up space, so I've come to Lausanne to figure out how they're going to do it. Most of the space junk orbiting Earth is within 2,000 kilometers of the Earth's surface. There are over 22,000 objects\n larger than this softball, and over half a million larger than this marble. Now, all of the orbiting debris is going about 7 to 8 kilometers per second, but since the objects are moving relative to one another, the average speed of a collision is about 10 kilometers per second.\n And an object this size, going 10 kilometers per second, has about the same impact as a mid-sized car going nearly 200 kilometers per hour. That's enough force to destroy any satellite in orbit. As a veteran of four space flights,\n science, Swiss astronaut Claude Nicolier knows the dangers first hand. All of the large debris are tracked by radar. We know the orbit exactly and sometimes we have to do the small change in the orbital characteristics\n of our spaceship, the Space Shuttle, because it was foreseen that next day or two days later we're going to have a close approach with the debris, such that NASA was not feeling too good about\n Fortunately, to date there haven't been any serious collisions with manned spacecraft. But in 2009, a single crash between two satellites added a whopping\n 2,000 new pieces of debris. So the Swiss, determined to do something about the problem, are\n extending their clean country reputation into outer space.\n of two satellites from Switzerland. One of these two satellites is appropriately named SwissCube. SwissCube is a small satellite which you see, this is a one-to-one model, so this is in the right scale.\n So the mission for Clean Space One is a proof of concept that it\n The janitor satellite can be sent into space to grab a piece of space junk, in this case Swiss Cube, and bring it back into the atmosphere where it'll burn up. But to rendezvous with the space junk, the small janitor needs an incredibly efficient engine.\n Working on the challenge is Professor Herbert Shea, an expert in micromechanics. This is your propulsion system. This is our propulsion system. Little silicon micro-machine ships. We use something called electric propulsion, which allows you to\n emit single atoms that are electrically charged and you use an electric field to accelerate them out so you're not burning them, you're emitting your propellant. And that's what many small satellites use, but nothing has been to date been able to make something this small.\n We do 0 to 60 miles an hour in about three days. But laughable as it indeed seems to all of us, because there's no friction in space, or negligible friction, then if we wait six months, we have a huge change in speed.\n how the mission will be done. Once propelled into the correct orbit, the next challenge is to grab the space junk, an object tumbling around uncontrollably without creating more debris. Our idea is to use a very compliant system. Can I think of an\n octopus arm. An octopus arm is very soft but it can grab any strange shape and wrap around it and hold it. And we'll have a grabber that looks in a very, the real one will be more sophisticated, but it looks like this. So it's basically a very, very soft elastomer. I'll turn it on in a minute. You can see how soft it is.\n The idea is this will be rolled up so it doesn't take up much room. We'll have 10 of these in a series. You get into space, you unroll it, and then these things can open when you turn the voltage on. You're able to open this and you turn the voltage off and it wraps around and it holds the satellite.\n Is this going to be a little bit like those games where you're trying to pick up a stuffed toy in the arcade and drop it somewhere? Is it going to be like that? Essentially, yes. Those games can be incredibly frustrating with those little arms. They're built to be frustrating.\n Whereas this, this is built to be, this is built to succeed. Can I ask, has anyone ever successfully gone up and grabbed a piece of space junk and gotten rid of it? To my knowledge, no. It's never been done before.\n I think grabs on Ambitious as it may sound the Swiss know how vast this junkyard is so their ultimate aims are more modest hopefully starting in say 2020 to do a systematic removal of the large debris at the rate of\n five or more per year in order to contain the increase of the debris density in low Earth orbit. Then space will continue becoming accessible. Of course the exposure to the space environment is a wonderful thing.\n I have come all the way from Australia to see it for myself. Welcome to Alaska.\n I'm at a Fairbanks and I'm trying to find the Northern Lights, the Aurora Coriolis."

            "transcription": "This video was sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show.\n On February 15th, 2013, over Chelyabinsk, Russia, an asteroid heavier than the Eiffel Tower slammed into the atmosphere, and then 30 kilometers above the ground, it exploded. This violent event\n The event was brighter than the sun, but so high up that it was silent for a full 90 seconds after the blast, which only made the devastation worse.\n What was that? They see the smoke trail in the sky. That's amazing. And then, you know, just when you think nothing's going to happen, the shockwave hits and it blows out the windows. A thousand people got glass in their face, in their eyes, because they're looking through the windows.\n The shockwave damaged thousands of buildings and injured 1,500 people. What makes the Chelyabinsk incident kind of embarrassing is that the very same day scientists had predicted that an\n asteroid would make a close flyby of Earth. And they were right. 16 hours after Chelyabinsk, a similar sized asteroid, known as Duende, came within 27,000 kilometers of Earth's surface. That's closer than\n satellites in geosynchronous orbit. But while they correctly predicted this close approach, they completely missed the unrelated asteroid that exploded over Russia. And the truth is, this happens all the time.\n really not that good at detecting asteroids before they hit us. Since 1988, over 1200 asteroids bigger than a meter have collided with the Earth, and of those, we detected only five before they hit.\n Never with more than a day of warning. With all our technology and all the telescopes across the earth, not to mention the ones in space, why do we struggle to detect dangerous asteroids before they strike? What are the chances\n that a big asteroid will hit, wiping out most if not all life on Earth? And if we saw one coming, what could we do about it?\n Asteroids are the leftover debris from when our solar system formed. Four and a half billion years ago, rocks and\n dust clumped together into molten protoplanets. Inside, heavy elements, metals like iron, nickel, and iridium, sank into the core, leaving lighter silicate minerals on the surface.\n Some of these protoplanets grew into the planets we know today, but many more collided with each other, breaking into pieces.\n These pieces continued orbiting the Sun and smashing into each other and breaking into even smaller fragments. These became the asteroids, which is why some of them are rocky.\n loose conglomerates of gravel-sized rocks called rubble piles, and others, from the cores of planetesimals, are mostly metal.\n Essentially it's the piece of a core of a small planetary body, like basically a small planet that formed four and a half billion years ago, differentiated so the core material fell out and then this thing was smashed\n Most of the asteroids have stable orbits between Mars and Jupiter, in the main asteroid belt.\n Some have made their way closer to Earth, and these are known as near-Earth objects. They are of greatest interest to us because of the threat they pose. In his last book, Stephen Hawking considered an\n impact to be the greatest threat to life on Earth. But finding asteroids is difficult for several reasons. Most are spotted by ground-based telescopes. So what you do is you take a sequence of pictures, one, two, three,\n But you have to look carefully. Asteroids are not very big\n big. They range from meters up to kilometers in size. And in the vast expanse of space, rocks like that just don't stand out. And even the small ones can be damaging. The Chelyabinsk meteor was only around 20 meters\n in diameter, roughly the width of two school buses. Plus, asteroids are rough and dark, they only reflect around 15% of the light that hits them. So our best chance to see them is when they're fully\n illuminated by the sun. And that's why over 85% of the near-Earth asteroids we've detected were found in the 45 degrees of sky directly opposite the sun. This is called the opposition effect, and it's\n It means there are likely more near-Earth and potentially hazardous asteroids that haven't been detected yet. Any asteroid approaching from the direction of the sun just can't be seen. This is exactly what happened with\n So far, we have detected and cataloged a million asteroids, the vast majority of which are in the main asteroid belt, but 24,000 are near Earth's surface.\n Earth objects, ones that we need to keep a particularly close eye on, because even once you've detected an asteroid, it's hard to tell if it will hit the Earth.\n really tell where it's going to go because you're trying to take this little arc of motion and predict it far into the future. So what you need is observations over years and years. But even if you have perfect observations of an asteroid, there's kind of a fundamental limit\n to how far in the future you can predict. And that's because a couple of effects. But one is that they're not just orbiting the sun with no other influence. All of the planets have gravity, and all of the planets are pulling on near-Earth\n and can change the orbit significantly. So there is something called dynamical chaos, which basically means after a certain amount of time, you don't know where the asteroid is going to be. And in practice, what that means is we can't do any work more\n And this is pretty important, because we know with certainty if one does hit the\n results will be dramatic. This is Barringer Crater in Arizona. It's named after mining engineer Daniel Barringer, who was the first to suggest it was formed by a meteorite impact.\n The failing view, even up until the 1950s, was that it was created by volcanic activity. But Berenger was convinced it was the site of an iron meteorite impact. So in 1903, he staked a mining claim and\n began drilling for the metallic meteorite, which he believed to be worth more than a billion 1903 dollars.\n the bottom of the crater and found nothing. And then they started to do other exploratory drills and this went on for years and decades. They started to drill sideways. Somebody said you know maybe it came in from an angle, which it did, and maybe the iron is not under the\n middle but maybe it's over there under the wall so he was doing drilling if you go there you can see the drills now he was drilling around the wall he found nothing so what they didn't realize is when you have an impact at high speed it's not like you're throwing a stone\n into a brick wall, you know, and it makes a hole and sticks in there or just bounces off. It's explosive. It's like totally explosive. So the kinetic energy of the projectile comes in maybe 30 kilometers per second. The kinetic energy of the projectile is big enough\n to completely vaporize the projectile, turns it into a gas, and that gas is super hot and super high pressure, and it explodes and it blows out the crater. So the projectile doesn't really exist after the impact, little pieces can survive, but this\n 50 meter body was basically obliterated. So he was looking for something that did not exist. He spent 27 years mining the crater, drilling down to a depth of over 400 meters. But what he was\n searching for had vaporized on impact 50,000 years earlier. The 50-meter asteroid, not that much bigger than Chelyabinsk, released the energy equivalent of 10 megatons of TNT,\n That's over 600 times the energy of the Hiroshima bomb. So the thing that most closely resembles a meteorite impact is a very large nuclear explosion.\n This is the actual size of the T-Rex Skull and I thought this is such a cool thing I gotta have it so I bought the T-Rex.\n The dinosaurs were wiped out by a 10 kilometer sized asteroid that hit about 65 million years ago. So above a critical size, which is probably a couple of kilometers, an impactor delivers\n so much energy that it has a global effect. So essentially it launches a whole bunch of debris into suborbital trajectories.\n The ejecta goes around the Earth, falls back into the Earth, all over, even on the other side of the planet from where the impact occurred. And what that means is the whole sky lights up with wall-to-wall meteors.\n So you can imagine the sky turning from, you know, a nice blue day like today into essentially a red hot glow like being inside a toaster oven. So the first effect of this impact apart from\n initial blast near where the actual impact occurred. The first effect is the sky turns into a great source of heat and it cooks everything on the ground. So these guys were basically cooked. Cooked alive. Cooked alive as they're walking around.\n The only animals that had a chance were the ones living in tunnels under the ground or maybe in the water. They were able to come back and take over without having to deal with the dinosaurs as a major obstacle.\n What are our chances that Earth gets hit by another 10km or bigger asteroid? In your lifetime, assume you live to be 100 years old, you have a 10km impactor like the KT extinction event every\n 100 million years or something like that. So the probability of getting it in one year is one in a hundred million. So you have one in a million chance of dying from a 10-kilometer impactor. But because we know that there are no 10-kilometer impactors,\n So the good news is, there won't be another\n dinosaur style extinction event in our lifetimes. But there are exponentially more asteroids of smaller sizes. For every 10km asteroid, there are roughly a thousand 1km asteroids.\n And they're still capable of doing a lot of damage.\n Do we know about all\n one to two kilometer bodies that could hit us? We think that we know 90 something percent, maybe 98 percent of those bodies have been identified and we have their orbits and we can make reasonable predictions for the next 10 years or\n And\n This is possibly where the greatest threat of asteroids remains. A few hundred meters is large enough to obliterate a large city, but small enough that we haven't detected them all yet. We're missing a lot of hundred meter size.\n projectiles and those guys are big enough to cause substantial damage on the earth depending on where they hit. So it could destroy a city? Yeah, it would knock down the buildings in the city, it would cause city-wide fire and if it hit the ground\n It would throw up ejecta that would come back down and rain on the ground. It would be high-speed ejecta that would obliterate a 100-kilometer zone around it. And this could happen tomorrow? Well, it could, yeah.\n If we saw a big one coming, what's our best bet for, I mean, could we do anything about it? What would we do about it? Is there anything we can do to actively? No, there's nothing we can do. I was on a committee\n We looked at that like 10 years ago, what could we do? One option would be to try to bomb it. It's a standard thing. We don't know how that would work out. Even when you got it there, and even if you could explode it on the surface or in the surface, it's not\n clear what you would do because typically what happens is you blow up a body and the fragments move out, they expand out, but not very quickly, and then gravity pulls them back together again. So it would reform as a rubble pile if it was not already a rubble pile to\n begin with, which it probably would be because of past impacts. So blowing up a rubble pile is something that we don't really know about. Another idea is you could attach, you could be all gentle, attach a rocket to the asteroid and just try to push it aside. Let's nudge it aside. Instead of trying\n to blow it up, let's just push it gently aside so that it deflects it and it doesn't hit the earth. The trouble is, when you work out the numbers, none of the rockets that we have can push it around enough. You would have to keep the rockets attached to the surface, which we don't know how to do. Remember, it's a rotating body.\n for centuries to have a significant effect on the motion of the asteroid. So forget bombs, forget attaching rockets. Ablating the surface, basically you boil the surface with a laser. We don't have any lasers powerful enough and probably can't make laser\n powerful enough to do that from the earth we would have to take the lasers to the object which is even more difficult. The idea that you could wrap an asteroid in cooking foil, aluminum cooking foil is another nice one that may be a good one the best one but it still doesn't really\n work because we don't know how to do that. We don't have a way to launch enough cooking foil to wrap up an asteroid and change its radiative properties which would itself move the asteroid around. So the truth is, to be honest, we do not have a way to\n Now to deflect a kilometer-sized asteroid at all that could destroy a country. Yeah, we just don't have a way and so it's on meters on 10 kilometers is absolutely a thousand times more hopeless so when when we discuss\n We discussed this, you know, we had all these grand ideas, we could do this and this, and none of them worked. We came down to the most basic idea, well, maybe if we could figure out where the asteroid is going to hit, like which city is it going to explode over, we could evacuate that city.\n the history of city evacuations and we looked at cases where, for example, you have a week's warning where some hurricane system is going to come in and flood a city and evacuation just doesn't work either.\n The reason is very, very simple. Going into a city, there are not that many freeways. If you have millions of people trying to get on a freeway, the first time a car breaks down, you block that freeway. So instantly, you have millions of people trying to get out of the target zone.\n and they won't be able to because all of the roads will be instantly blocked. So again, even that, even evacuation of a city is probably the most hopeful thing that we could try to do. Even that's really, really difficult because of the\n large numbers of people involved. What I think all reasonable people would conclude is, let's do the thing that we can do first. So let's look for them. Let's do the surveys. Let's build the telescopes. Let's put this telescope in space. That will be\n a major contribution to understanding the threat from the asteroids. And then when we find a particular object that looks especially dangerous, then we can focus on it. We can focus everything we have on it and we can begin\n to think seriously and with real motivation about ways to deflect it. Now if you're concerned about the world ending in an asteroid impact, let me set your mind at ease. There are many other potential global\n asterisks summarized in this map of doom made by my friend Dom over at Domain of Science.

            "transcription": "I've come to Caltech because there is a brand new gravitational wave discovery. Let's go find out what it is.\n the discovery runner? Yeah. Can I, I want to sit on one of my black holes. Alright. If you notice, this one's a big one. And that one's a little one. This one is a little one. Yeah. I always feel like I'm the most excited\n out of everybody. Really? Yeah. I'm excited when nothing's happening, cleaning some dust off a piece of glass, and it still seems exciting. I think this is the key piece of glass in our system, and I would just clean dust off of it. How cool is that? On January 4th, just like\n a few hours after midnight, boom, we got another signal much like the first signal we found in September of 2015. And it's also well represented by these black holes that we're sitting on.\n The black holes had a mass of about 30 solar masses and the other one was about 20. This one lasted longer than the first one, both because our detectors are better at the lowest frequencies.\n because the signal is from black holes which are smaller so they last longer. And it's really dramatic if you listen to the audio. The first signal that we got, it's only audible for about a tenth of a second. It just boom, like that.\n this, but this new one sounds like boom, but it's a little bit more drawn out and it comes from farther away. It's the furthest black hole merger that we've been able to detect, so it's at about three billion light years away, which means\n What's particularly interesting in this merger are hints that the two black holes weren't spinning with the same orientation as each other, or as their orbit.\n that rather than forming out of binary stars, they formed separately and later became entwined through orbital dynamics.\n The universe is not just populated by all tiny, tiny black holes or by no black holes. If we improve our detector sensitivity by say a factor of two or three, the rates will go up from seeing one every month or every two months to\n seeing one every day or every week. I would say it's very surprising now that our first three signals came from binary black hole mergers, which were pretty much an unexpected source as of mid-2015.\n There's a working theory, it's kind of exotic, that says that some of the black holes we're seeing are primordial. They weren't formed through conventional supernova explosions, they were formed during the Big Bang themselves. And they could be a part of dark matter, a component of dark matter.\n So we may actually determine after we get statistics on lots and lots and lots of these black hole mergers that we're actually seeing maybe a hint of dark matter. It's sort of scratching at the door of the biggest mysteries that we have today in cosmology.\n In the past, before there were any signals, people used to use this phrase, which I completely disagree with, and they would say, you know, if we don't find any signals, it will be even more interesting than if we do. I said, no, no, no, no, no.\n No, no, no, no, lots of signals, that's what we want. But now that we have a few, I'm feeling a little bit more complacent. And so I'd say we really expected to see a lot of binary neutron stars. And if we don't, well, isn't that interesting?\n It means there's something going on. You have all the pieces. We have to know how neutron stars work. We've seen neutron stars using radio astronomy. We know they're out there. We know that they come together in binaries. But why don't we see their gravitational waves?\n So it could be something else happens to them just before the final merger. And there's something in their evolutionary track which goes off in a different direction than what we expect. And I think that would actually be interesting. I guess I've become one of those people that said,\n If you don't see it, then maybe it's interesting. Because we'll learn something. You never know how many more signals we have sitting in the can that we're not telling you about. Can you say that again? I don't think so. Would you give me the exclusive?\n around it? I would. You know, Derek, come on. If I had secret signals, you'd be the first to know. These lights are the first two tentacles of a jellyfish I'm building, and there's a neural\n network which then drives this little chip which modulates these lights. And it's going to use these sensors like the proximity and the sound to figure out if people are close to it. And the neural network is going to train itself to flash the tentacle lights to make people come\n closer to it."

Yeah, but I guess it's probably really weak. Not on the astronauts, because they just float around.

That's clever. Because now I want to say that they're outside of Earth's gravitational pull, but I just said that the moon wasn't. You got me.\n Think about this, the space station is only about 400 kilometers away. So if you're in Sydney, it's about, well, a little further than the drive to Canberra. Do you really think that the earth exerts a big gravitational pull on you?\n But nothing on the astronauts a short distance away? Well the truth is this, the force on the astronauts is almost as much as the force on you.\n So why are they floating while you're stuck here? The answer is the astronauts aren't floating, they're falling. And not only that, but the space station that they're in is falling as well.\n So why doesn't the space station come crashing into the earth? Well the reason is the space station and the astronauts have a huge sideways velocity of nearly 28,000 kilometers per hour.\n So even though they're falling towards the earth, they're going so fast that as they fall towards the earth, the earth's surface curves away from them, and therefore they never get any closer. So the space station and the atmosphere\n astronauts inside are constantly accelerating towards the Earth's center, but they never get any closer. And because both objects are accelerating at the same rate, the astronauts feel weightless. They have this amazing sensation of floating.\n Oh!"

But the conditions haven't been ideal because tonight it's a bit cloudy, a bit hazy, and we've got a moon out which is nearly full\n So it makes it very difficult to spot these northern lights. So what are we actually looking at up there with the aurora? The electromagnetic fields working through the gravity, you know, and the particles that work off of that. What do you have to have happen in\n in order to get those lights. Cold. You're going to be looking at solar activities. It has to do with solar flares as the flares are coming. I know it has to be something with the sun and discharge and it's solar flare.\n Sun has just put on quite a show. Take a look at these amazing pictures captured by a NASA spacecraft yesterday. It's a powerful solar flare shooting superheated particles and plasma deep into space. No one knows what's really going on in those pictures. They just look cool. Don't they?\n They just look cool so we put it on the news. So what sort of stuff is coming from the sun? It is... I believe it's solar radiation. Other than that...\n I don't know. Photons and, you know, neurons. Superfluidity of neurons. What's the sun made of, mostly? Hydrogen, I believe. Yeah. So if the sun spits out some of that stuff...\n Right. It would be... What is a hydrogen atom? What's it made of? Just hydrogen, neutrons, electrons, you know. In the case of hydrogen, it's the simplest atom. It's just a proton.\n and an electron. That's it. So when we're talking about stuff coming from the sun, we're talking about streams of protons and electrons. There's stuff coming from the sun, and then what does it do? It lights up. They're just there.\n They're just there. Yeah, they just happen. Well, I've had a little bit of luck and I've been trying to shoot them so I'll put up some of that footage so you can check it out and you can think about these particles that must be streaming in from the Sun, colliding with our upper atmosphere and\n then exciting it and so it releases that light when it de-excites. Why does it come to Alaska and not say Hawaii or\n the Caribbean is the northern lights it isn't well why you guys are special I'm not sure honestly like it's been seen down in like Mexico and stuff it's like the Reds have been seen down in Mexico I've actually seen it\n in Mexico where my grandmother lives. I think it just has to do with the northern hemisphere and how much like little less sun we get so you can see it more. I'm sure it happens in the southern hemisphere. You just have a lot of light down there. Like the sky is brighter at night?\n Well, oh god. I'm just asking. I don't know. I don't know. It has to do with magnetic fields. The closer you get to the magnetic fields, the more the lights you're able to see. And then yeah, you're right about the magnetosphere deflects them around towards the poles, then they hit the atmosphere and they excite the atmosphere.\n And when it de-excites it's giving off that light. So I'm here in Fairbanks with T. Neil Davis and thank you for speaking to me today. You're welcome. Alright, so we were out looking for the Aurora. I guess one major question that a lot of people would have is, what is it?\n And it roars as a result of charged particles coming down the magnetic, long magnetic field lines, which is essentially vertical here, and those high speed particles then strike\n the gases in the upper atmosphere and impart energy to those gases, excite the atoms and molecules. Fairly shortly thereafter, the atoms and molecules de-activate\n the tide by giving off quantum light and that's what we see. What about the weather? You know last night it seemed like it was a bit overcast or there were some there was some cloud up there. Does that also hinder? Oh yes. It wasn't a thick cloud layer but there just seemed to be a bit of a haze.\n We had the moon out. Oh, well then you're really in trouble. Yeah with the moon out and a little haze then it's pretty tough to see the road. So do you have any advice for us? How do we deal with conditions like that?\n That's a go to a bar and have a drink, I guess.\n right here that would be the size of the earth you could put 20 earths or so inside just that circle where the explosion occurred"

            "transcription": "This is the first ever image of a black hole, released by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration on April 10th, 2019. It shows plasma orbiting the supermassive black hole at the center\n of the galaxy M87. The bright region shows where plasma is coming towards us, and since it's traveling near the speed of light, it appears brighter when coming towards us and dimmer when going away. This is called relativistic beaming. From the image\n scientists can tell that the plasma is orbiting clockwise. It takes around two days for the plasma to complete one orbit. Here we are looking at the black hole using electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters, radio waves.\n This was the part of the spectrum used to make the image because it can show us the features close in to the event horizon and it can pass through the accretion disk and interstellar dust to reach our telescopes. The supermassive black hole in M87\n is very active, meaning it's constantly feeding on lots of matter from its glowing hot accretion disk. But it also has narrow collimated jets above and below it, here shown in blue, thought to be created by incredibly strong\n magnetic fields. The jets extend out at least 5,000 light years and one of them appears to be pointing almost straight at us. Relativistic beaming is again the reason we can see the jet coming towards us in this Hubble Space\n telescope image but not the one going away. Since the jet is pointed almost straight at us, I'm thinking our perspective is almost perpendicular to the accretion desk. But let's have a look at what we would see if we were looking\n looking at different orientations. The warping of spacetime around the black hole means we can see light even from parts of the accretion disk behind the black hole. They are lensed above and below the\n region. Not gonna lie, this is so trippy I could stare at it for a long time. So the big question most people are going to be asking is why is the image so fuzzy? The answer is\n because it's so tiny. Don't get me wrong, the black hole itself is huge, supermassive in fact. As measured from this picture, the black hole has a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun. The actual size of its\n This shadow is nearly the size of our solar system. But located 53 and a half million light years away, its size from our perspective is only about 40 micro arc seconds. That's the angle it makes on the sky.\n what that means. Take the whole sky and divide it into 180 degrees. Then divide a degree into 60 arc minutes and an arc minute into 60 arc seconds. Divide an arc second into\n into a hundred and into a hundred again and into a hundred once more and that is the size of the black hole shadow only about\n It puts us at the very limit of what we are technologically capable of seeing. In fact, to get this sort of resolution, due to the basic law of physics, the diffraction limit, we needed a telescope the size of the Earth.\n That being impractical, the scientists used eight telescopes spread across the globe. They all simultaneously observed M87, and as the Earth rotated, that helped fill in the Earth-sized telescope that they\n were trying to simulate. But M87 was not the only black hole they looked at. They also observed the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A-star. They haven't yet released an image of this black\n hole, but this simulation shows what it might look like. It's much closer at around 26,000 light years away, but also much smaller, with a mass only four million times that of our Sun. It's also less active, only periodically\n bubbling up matter, and it would have much more variation over time with matter orbiting every 4 to 30 minutes. That's probably why we'll have to wait a little longer to see the black hole at the center of our galaxy. For now, the striking image of the black hole in M87\n confirms beyond a shadow of a doubt that black holes do exist. The general theory of relativity published over a hundred years ago is supported again in spectacular fashion in the strongest gravities and at the limit\n of our ability to test the theory. What I love about moments like this is the ridiculous extreme things these scientists did, these 200 scientists in pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible and yet they achieved it.\n I want to extend my personal congratulations to everyone on the team for an amazing discovery. I'll be linking to all their work in the description.\n you"

            "transcription": "This is such an awesome experience to get up close and personal with the Curiosity rover. I mean this isn't the exact one that's on Mars obviously.\n but is basically identical. I'm here at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California. I don't know how we got in here, Bill. It's amazing. This is the NASA center that's famous for building things like the Mars Rover, space probes,\n and rescuing Matt Damon from the red planet. You guys must get pretty sick of answering questions about the Martian. Yes. This is project scientist Ken Farley. I spoke with him about life on Mars. He's one of many scientists working on the first NASA mission\n in 40 years designed specifically to look for life on another planet. It's called Mars 2020. If there were life on Mars, wouldn't we have found it by now? No, we would not have found it by now. But we've been looking. There's been a number of missions like the Viking\n part of the problem is, we're not even sure what we're looking for. Life on Mars may have been completely different from life on Earth. Recent missions like the Curiosity and Exploration Rovers look for\n and found evidence of water, a key ingredient for life.\n instead of anything on the surface of Mars today. There's no life on the surface of Mars today. Most likely, if there is life on Mars today, it would be underground, underneath the ice caps, in places that are very, very hard to investigate.\n with the sort of rovers and landers that we've sent so far. So we're talking like moles, groundhogs. Well, microscopic bacterial moles. No, not actual moles. We're looking for, we call them biosignatures. It's a pattern or a substance in the\n the rocks that can only have been formed by life. To find those biosignatures, the 2020 rover is going to need cutting-edge technologies developed here at JPL. But for definitive proof of life, they'll need drill samples.\n We need to take a core that's about the size of a piece of chalk. We have to collect 37 tubes like this that will ultimately be laid on the surface of Mars for possible return in the future. Mars 2020 is different from past missions because now NASA will need to bring those samples back to Earth.\n to test them for evidence of life. So in order to find life, we'll have to return those samples from Mars\n something that's never been done before, and test those samples with techniques that haven't even been invented yet. So I had to ask... How good do you think your chances are at finding life? I'd say they're poorer than even just because I\n I remain skeptical. Regardless, we will learn about what the early history of the solar system is like. And that's the same environment, the same solar system that Earth was in when life was evolving. If you want to understand the origin of life on Earth, because that's the\n only place we know life exists. The rocks that recorded that are all gone. So in a way looking at Mars is like looking at a version of Earth frozen in time right about when life would have sprung. That's I think the most exciting way\n to look at it.\n that is trying to discover life. This is cool.\n I don't get to go into the kind of crazy detail that I sometimes do on this channel. For example, this image is the first ever beamed back from the Martian surface. It was taken by the Soviet lander Mars 3 on December 2nd, 1971. After beginning\n becoming the first man-made object to make a soft landing on Mars, that lander transmitted data back to Earth for just 14.5 seconds before going quiet. And no one really knows what happened to it, but it might have had something to do\n with the huge dust storm that was taking place at the time. Now this is the first clear image sent back from the Martian surface. It was taken by the Viking 1 lander on July 20th 1976 and one of the stated aims for that mission was to try to find evidence of\n existing life on the Martian surface. And there was this experiment called the labeled release experiment where a scoop of Martian soil was taken and then a dilute solution of nutrients was added into that soil. But in those nutrients was the radioactive\n carbon-14. The idea was if you try to detect the gases around the soil, if you detect some radioactive carbon dioxide, you know that the nutrients were broken down by something in the soil, presumably something that's living. What was remarkable about this experiment was\n that it got a positive result. There were a few other experiments trying to detect life in other ways and they failed to get a detection, but this one detected radioactive carbon dioxide. And what's even more impressive was the Viking 2 lander, which\n tried the same experiment after the Viking 1 lander, it also got the same positive result. So things were looking promising. But then, about a week later, they tried to rerun the experiment, add a little bit more nutrients to the soil and see if you could get more CO2.\n But they couldn't. There was no additional CO2 released. So based on these negative results and the negative results of the other experiments, most scientists have concluded that there is no surviving life on the surface of Mars today.\n So how is the CO2 produced in the first place? Well, chemists suspect that very highly oxidizing chemicals, things like perchlorates, exist in the Martian soil and would have reacted with the nutrients producing the CO2 to start with. But once those chemicals are used up,\n up? Well there's nothing for those nutrients to react with and so we get no CO2 the next time the nutrients are introduced. This story highlights just how difficult searching for life is using only remote instruments and that's why for Mars 2020 they're going to create some rock\n samples that should be returned to Earth. If only they can get the budget for another mission that will go back and pick them up. But the rover they're sending in 2020 will also have some new tools on board that will allow them to look at rocks in finer detail than ever before. One tool called the\n Pixel will use X-ray spectrometry to try to detect chemical elements with a spatial resolution that goes down to the size of a grain of salt. Now what they'd be looking for are layered structures, similar to stromatolites found here on Earth.\n Those are mineral deposits which get built up by billions and billions of tiny organisms. So you're not really looking for fossils or for tiny little, you know, microbial evidence. We're looking for the structures that they would have produced, layered structures.\n That's how we know about the oldest life on Earth, and so it's logical to think that's how we might find out about this old life on Mars. And the job of finding evidence of past or current life on Mars is made even more difficult by planetary protection. That's the principle whereby we\n we should not introduce any life from Earth to these places where we're studying, like Mars. And that's completely understandable because, I mean, the worst discovery of life we could make on Mars would be life that we introduce there by our spacecraft.\n Certain organisms are really hardy even in the vacuum of space and even when bombarded by radiation. But due to this constraint, spacecraft must be strenuously sterilized and also they're restricted from landing near sites where we think there may be liquid water.\n I'm really looking forward to the results of the Mars 2020 mission and hopefully a later mission where we actually go back and collect the samples that were placed there. But one thing that really struck me from my interview with Ken Farley was when he said that Mars is really like a time capsule of the rocks that are\n Earth had when life evolved here. That's a way I'd never really thought about it before, but of course because of plate tectonics and all the weathering that have taken place on Earth, we don't have the rock record from when life was first evolving on this planet. And that makes Mars a\n really good place to look not only for new forms of life but also for an understanding of how life on earth may have begun.\n you"

            "transcription": "Is there water on the moon? The obvious answer seems to be no, because during a day on the moon, which lasts two Earth weeks, the temperature on the lunar surface gets up to 123 degrees Celsius, which would be an\n enough to boil away any water if the moon had an atmosphere like Earth's, which it doesn't. And the reason that it doesn't is because the moon's gravity is weak, just a sixth of Earth's gravity, which means it can't hold on to light, fast-moving molecules like\n water. Anything going faster than 2.4 kilometers per second, the moon's escape velocity, is gone. Now that might sound pretty quick, but at any given temperature there are always a small number of molecules going significantly faster than the average. On the moon, these\n molecules fly off into space and then other molecules take their place until all the light fast moving molecules are gone. Plus, since the moon has a very weak magnetic field, there's little to protect the lunar surface from the solar wind. That's the stream of charged particles coming from\n the sun. These particles can effectively blast molecules from the surface of the moon into space. In fact, that's how Mars lost most of its atmosphere. So in short, if the moon ever had any water, it should be long gone by now. And this appeared to be\n confirmed by the moon landings. Rock samples brought back by Apollo astronauts contained virtually no hydrated minerals. Some water was detected, but it was assumed just to be terrestrial contamination rather than actual moon water. Because seals on some of the sample\n return containers were damaged by the gritty moon dust. But in 2009, a very different picture emerged when scientists intentionally crashed part of a rocket into the surface of the moon. It was going 2.5 kilometers per second on impact, making\n a crater 25 meters wide and 4 meters deep. That ejected 10,000 tons of material with half of it making it high enough to be lit by the Sun. That allowed cameras on an orbiting spacecraft to look for the emission lines of water in the dust.\n And what did they find? Well, the water emission lines were bright. Scientists estimated that 5.6% of the mass of the ejected debris was water. But how is this possible? Where did the water come from and how did it remain on the moon?\n Well, strangely enough, there are actually three different sources of lunar water. To understand the first source, you just have to look at where they crashed that rocket into the moon. Now, it's a misconception that the moon has a dark side, although the same side always faces\n Earth, all sides of the moon do receive sunlight. However, at the poles there are some craters which, due to their location and depth, are always in shade. They're called the permanently shadowed regions. Now, since they never see the sun, these craters are\n of the coldest places in the whole solar system, colder than the surface of Pluto. They can reach negative 249 Celsius, and it is here that scientists decided to crash that piece of rocket. Since the permanently shattered regions maintain such\n consistently low temperature, they act as cold traps, places where volatiles like water remain frozen as ice. But where would the water come from in the first place? Well, from water containing comets and asteroids that have struck the moon.\n over time. Any water molecules that found their way to the permanently shadowed regions would be trapped there forever as ice. But this is not the only source of water on the moon. In the lunar samples from Apollo 15 and 17, scientists found tiny\n glass beads. These beads were formed back when the moon was still volcanically active. Fire fountains launched droplets of lava into space where they cooled rapidly and then fell back to the surface. In 2007 these beads were sliced in half and tested for water.\n The results showed significant amounts of water with concentrations highest in the middle of the beads. Now this indicates that the water must have been trapped there during the initial eruption rather than leaching in due to contamination once those beads were back on Earth.\n Now, this water came from the interior of the moon, so the moon must have contained water to begin with. Which kind of makes sense considering the moon is likely a piece of earth that broke off billions of years ago in an impact with a Mars sized body.\n The third and final source of water on the moon is water created on the moon's surface from the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen. Now the source of oxygen is easy. Oxygen makes up 45% of the lunar surface.\n bound in oxide minerals. But where do you get the free hydrogen? The answer is in the solar wind, which is constantly bombarding the moon's surface with protons. These can react with oxygen to form hydroxide and ultimately water. This\n water can then drift over the surface of the moon until either it flies off into space or it lands in the cold traps and becomes ice. So there is water on the moon and this is important because it means that future missions can take advantage of this valuable\n resource not only for moon colonists to drink and grow crops but also for processing into rocket fuel. If you can make your own rocket fuel on the moon that dramatically reduces the challenges and costs of space travel. For a long time we used to\n think the moon was completely dry. But now we know that hypothesis is all wet. Big news! I have a brand new channel called Sciencium where I'm posting videos in this format.

On YouTube there seems to be some pretty good evidence about it but I don't know. You've seen some videos of aliens? Yeah. That look convincing. Kinda, yeah. So the Anunnaki apparently were beings that came down from heaven.\n according to the old Sumerian text. The wall paintings and stuff in Sumaria, Sumeria. I think people believe that aliens have visited us just because they're not aware of how vast the universe really is.\n I mean, what is an exoplanet? How far is a light year? These are the things you need to understand if you're to judge the probability that alien life could come and visit us. What is a galaxy?\n Specifically, I wouldn't know. Is a galaxy something totally different, like another universe? A galaxy has a sun and a moon, doesn't it? So, a galaxy bigger than that?\n Galaxies, hundreds of stars, blah blah blah. In fact, hundreds of billions of stars. Billions of stars. Yeah, hundreds of billions. What is a galaxy? It's a collection of stars and gas that are\n built together in a gravitationally bound system. Every point of light that you see here is a star. When we say 200 billion stars, it's probably at least 200 billion stars. The galaxy is 100,000 light years across, so it's just the\n distances are unimaginable. One light year, don't forget, is 10 trillion kilometres. What's a light year? You're an engineer. A light year is a thousand years, isn't it? A light year is a thousand years, isn't it? About 150 human years would be a light year.\n That's what I believe it would be. Is it distance? Is it distance? A light year? Have you heard the term exoplanet? No. No? Never. Exoplanets? Nah. Like a planet that we're not aware of? Well, exo-shouldn't be short for something.\n Extraterrestrial planet, extraterrestrial life maybe. Something outside our planet. So an exoplanet is simply a planet that orbits a star other than the sun. Exo just means external, outside, so outside our solar system.\n So it's just a planet. How many have you found? Me personally? I found six. But overall we now know of over 800 planets that have been confirmed and another probably 2000\n planets that are awaiting confirmation but are pretty strong candidates. So we don't see the planet directly, we see its impact on the star that it orbits. We do it from the ground with the Anglo-Australian telescope and we look for the wobble of the star at\n the planet orbits it. The planet goes around and the star moves backwards and forwards. So if you can imagine seeing that from sort of along the line of sight a little bit more, say like in this cartoon here, then you would see the star moving towards you\n moving away from you. And so what we see here is the light from the star becoming ever so slightly bluer as it moves towards us and ever so slightly redder as it moves away. The big problem is that the main kind of planet you end up finding with\n this wobble technique because it's really reliant on the mass of the planet basically like Jupiter, Saturn and then we've started to get down to Neptune and Uranus. To find smaller planets NASA launched Kepler a one meter telescope with a 95 megapixel\n Its mission is to observe 130,000 stars in our galaxy and look for dips in brightness caused by planets passing in front of them.\n size to the terrestrial planets, the rocky planets in our own solar system. So you have the star in the middle, then you have three inner planets. There's a green band which is this habitable zone, the Goldilocks zone, where you can expect liquid water to exist on the surface of the planet.\n In fact there are two planets inside the habitable zone around Kepler 62. If you're going to start looking for life around nearby stars, this is probably the best one to start with. Is there life beyond the Earth? Well we don't know for sure. We can't say yes, definitely.\n definitely, but the probability is very high. There are at least 200 billion stars in our galaxy. We now know that on average there is at least one planet per star in our galaxy alone and there are another 100 plus billion galaxies in the universe. We also now know thanks to\n So there is no definitive evidence that\n alien life exists. But the sheer size of the numbers suggest that they must be out there somewhere. But with the vast distances across the universe, chances are it's going to be a long time before we know for certain that we are not alone.\n This video was created as part of a collaboration addressing ten unanswered science questions. So subscribe to Veritasium and then check out the other nine questions by clicking the link.\n Is there more than one galaxy out there? Yeah, probably. How many would you say? I couldn't tell you. It's probably more than on my 10th and\n fingers I guess. It's more than a hundred billion. A hundred billion probably. It's crazy. Yeah."

            "transcription": "This is the most spectacular natural light show on Earth. These images, filmed from the International Space Station, capture what has drawn people\n people from around the world for centuries. I have come all the way from Australia to see it for myself. Welcome to Alaska. I'm just outside of Fairbanks and I'm trying to find the Northern Lights, the Aurora Borealis.\n As the Sun enters the peak of its 11-year sunspot cycle, it ejects high-speed electrons and protons into space. Deflected by the Earth's magnetic field, they collide with the Sun's magnetic field.\n with the upper atmosphere near the poles, producing the aurora. But with spectacular lights also comes the threat of disruption to our technological infrastructure.\n Streaming in from the Sun can damage satellites, cause extensive power outages, and disrupt the flight paths of planes around the poles. Scientists warn that unless we find out more about solar storms, we are extremely vulnerable.\n to a geomagnetic catastrophe. To further this research, I'm joining a team of scientists, teachers, and students.\n Today we're flying over the snow-covered mountains of Denali National Park to test out our gear in spectacular surrounds. So what sort of research are you doing?\n We typically do high-altitude balloon launches. That's sort of the gist of Project Ether. For students especially that don't have access to the near-space environment, you know, we try to open that up. We're trying to further the science of a rural research and looking at the details\n of how the global electrical circuit connects and how the aurora plays into that and causes this beautiful aurora and the physics involved there. Light her up. Using a full tank of helium,\n The team inflates a latex weather balloon to 2 meters in diameter. This provides enough lift for a 6 to 7 kilogram payload. We're going to send this up, well, about 25 kilometers or so. This will help us assess wind conditions in the upper atmosphere.\n in preparation for tonight's launch into the Aurora.\n flexible until it keeps expanding and expanding and expanding. You go from about six or eight feet up to about 30 feet diameter, so you know, 10 meters. So you're the size of a small house at that point, you know.\n Eventually you reach some limit where it just can't keep expanding and then it pops and then you fall back down and we fall by parachutes. The recovered footage provides a stunning view from the edge of space.\n But the real challenge is launching a weather balloon into the aurora at night. The conditions haven't been ideal because tonight it's a bit cloudy, a bit hazy, and we've got a moon out which is nearly full so it makes\n it very difficult to spot these Northern Lights. The balloon must rise into the stratosphere at just the right moment to catch the intermittent aurora in action.\n The next morning, we're on the hunt for the payload. From 30 balloons only\n one caught sight of the aurora. This is the first shot of the aurora from a weather balloon at nearly eye level. For them to build something\n sort of rig, put a camera on it, touch it, lick it, smell it, send it up 100,000 feet to the edge of space and get it back. You know, it's really awesome to see those pictures and to see that your device went up there. With young scientists taking up the challenge\n these images and the data gathered provide just a glimpse into the future of research on the aurora and how solar emissions affect our lives.\n you"

The atom was the smallest indivisible part of an element. We can further divide an atom into protons and neutrons. Protons and neutrons, is that it? It's just a small little thing that's made up of protons, electrons,\n Mae'r materiaeth a'r pethau yn cael eu cymryd o atamau a yna mae'r nuclewyr a'r electronau sy'n mynd ar y lles. Mae'n atam, a'n cael eu cymryd o atamau a electronau, gallai bod llawer o'r electronau yn gweithio arall yn ymwneud \u00e2'r\n orbits and it's mainly mainly nothing. This is how it's represented. Yep. There's the proton and that's the electron and then you have a neutron in there as well and this thing spins around but... So it seems most people are comfortable\n with the idea that all matter is made up of atoms, that an atom is the fundamental building block of matter, and that these atoms are made up of smaller particles called protons, electrons, and neutrons. But after that the details get a little\n little bit hazy. It looks a bit like Saturn. So what I'd like to do is actually build an atom or at least a model of an atom. So I've got here proton, neutron and electron.\n The simplest atom that I can make is hydrogen, because hydrogen consists of only two particles, a little positive proton and a tiny little negative electron. They're attracted to each other because of their opposite charge.\n And so many people think of the electron as orbiting about the proton. That's not strictly true. I mean, it's not like a planet going around the sun, but because the proton is positively charged and the electron is negatively charged, they're both attracted.\n attracted towards each other. Now what would happen if we took our hydrogen atom, which consists just of a proton and an electron, and we added a neutron into the nucleus? This hasn't really changed anything electrically\n because the proton and the electron are still opposite charges and attracting each other and the neutron is neutral so it doesn't really affect this interaction. So the atom that we have here is still hydrogen except it's just a little bit more massive. You could say\n it's heavier because the neutron is there. But how does that really affect the behavior of this atom? Well the truth is it's not that different to regular hydrogen. And this is what we call an isotope.\n An isotope is a different version of the same element, so it has the same number of protons in the nucleus, but just a different number of neutrons."

You can break it apart, add an oxygen atom, and you make H2O, water.\n A carbon with four hydrogens, that is methane. And you can actually combine it with water to make... methanol. These are Snatums, the magnetic molecular modeling kit. And I am Derek Muller, the creator of a YouTube channel called Veritasium, which has nearly\n million subscribers. Through my videos I teach science virtually to millions of people around the world. But some things are best learned hands-on, like chemistry. I mean atoms are impossible to see and chemical notation can be very confusing for students.\n And that's why as a teacher for seven years before I started Veritasium, I always wished that something like this existed. Snathams are an improvement over ball and stick models for three reasons. They are quicker to put together and break apart, plus they are better\n representation of what a molecule actually looks like. I mean bonds are not sticks, they're overlapping electron orbitals. And most important, snatoms allow you to feel the attraction between atoms. And that helps break the misconception that bonds store energy. This is something\n I talked to Hank Green about on SciShow Talk Show. Where is the energy coming from? The bonds man. But my concern is this right if you think that there really is energy in bonds. Yeah Then you would imagine something like breaking those bonds open releases that energy\n right which is totally false that is true this is my point the formation of bonds that releases energy and it's the breaking of bonds which takes energy with snathams you can easily feel the work you need to do to break a bond and you can hear the\n energy released when a new bond forms. I have been developing Snadams for over two years. The first prototypes I made out of styrofoam balls that I cut and put magnets in. You may have seen this picture on my Instagram. Then I made drawings for the product and had them 3D printed.\n And then I created some injection molded prototypes which I spray painted and used in my video five fun physics phenomena Now I need your help to make this project a reality Veritasium has shown me there are millions of people out there passionate about helping others understand\n science. So if you agree with me that this would help that snatoms should exist in the world, then help me fund the production molds and magnets required to make this happen. A basic snatoms kit would include six carbon atoms, six oxygens, and twelve hydrogens. That's all\n the atoms you need to make glucose, the basic sugar molecule. But of course with these building blocks you could build hundreds of other molecules and I will make some video guides explaining how to use sn atoms to learn about molecules, chemical bonding, geometry and balancing equations.\n And if we reach a stretch target, I will add another element to the kit, like nitrogen. Plus if we reach a further stretch target, I will build an app that will gamify the process of learning, allowing users to learn about new molecules and capture their progress.\n I think the best way to learn science is hands on from a young age. And if you want to help me make this happen, then support this Kickstarter. You don't have to buy a set of Snadams, though that definitely would help. But if you think it's a good idea, just share it with your friends on Twitter or Facebook. I really\n appreciate your support and I look forward to helping the world learn science physically in addition to through the internet."

            "transcription": "This is the biggest, hottest, and most explosive video on fireworks ever, covering everything from the invention of gunpowder to how fire can burn underwater,\n fireworks are made, the colors, shapes, fuses, to how they're launched. We'll even see what it's like to fly through fireworks.\n Mr. Beast has got nothing on this. This video was sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show. I cannot believe that for\n I think so.\n So lots of very filmic stuff. A lot of drone work. Lately, a lot of drone stuff. Okay. A lot of fast drone stuff. FPV drones. Like this one. Are you willing to fly this into a firework as it's exploding? That's the goal. If I can catch it.\n That's the hope, but we set it up just for that, so I think we could get it. The first recorded instance of something like a firework occurred in China over 2000 years ago, where people\n would get a piece of bamboo with the ends closed and they would throw it in a fire. So as it heated up, everything inside would get hot and expand and eventually burst, creating this bang, which they thought scared off evil spirits.\n developed black powder and they put black powder inside the bamboo to make an even bigger bang. That was much more impressive. I want to test out the earliest known recipe for gunpowder. It involves three ingredients that you can find out in\n nature. The first is potassium nitrate which actually comes from bat and bird guano. Once they poop in the cave and it dissolves in water you get these white crystals coming out. The second ingredient is sulfur these yellow crystals you can just\n find on the side of hills or around thermal vents. And the third ingredient is honey. That is a major fuel for the gunpowder. Now I'm gonna mix this all up. Looks like it could be frosting. So yummy. Earliest known\n recipe for gunpowder. What people observed was when they heated up this mixture it would spontaneously catch fire. I have no idea how big of a thing this is gonna be. This is only about a gram of it so I don't think it's gonna be huge.\n As we heat up that very primitive gunpowder, we should see it burst into flames. It's gotta be close. Here we go, here we go. Yes! We have made gunpowder. Now that took a long time before we saw the fire, so why is that?\n Well, honey contains a lot of water and that's gonna slow down the rate at which this is gonna start to combust. People figured out that a better fuel was charcoal. There are three things you need to make fire. Fuel, oxygen, and\n and heat. In most fires, the oxygen comes from the air, but in gunpowder, the oxygen is supplied by one of the solid ingredients.\n And the charcoal provides the fuel, that carbon. Charcoal is basically just carbon, but it works better than other forms of carbon like graphite because it contains these microscopic pores. And that enables the reactants to mix much better.\n can actually get inside those pores. So if you mix potassium nitrate with the fuel, charcoal, and add heat from a lighter, you should have all the ingredients you need to make fire. So the question is, will this burn?\n It seems like little bits of it are catching on fire and just like sparking up from there. But the trouble with this reaction is that it has a high activation energy. So it needs a lot of heat to get going. Whoa. There it goes.\n That is cool! I can see little balls of molten stuff in the crucible there. That is awesome! So we do have oxygen and fuel and we can get that\n reaction, but it's just not a very explosive reaction. This is where the sulfur comes in. Sulfur starts reacting with the other ingredients at lower temperatures, and those reactions give off heat. The sulfur is going to act like kindling. It's going\n to create that initial bit of heat that potassium nitrate needs to really break it open and then you know everything can react. So that's what I want to do. I want to try to mix sulfur, potassium nitrate, and charcoal which is like your quintessential recipe for gunpowder.\n The amounts that you need of this have been pretty stable for like 800 years, which is about 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulfur, and 15% charcoal. Those are the right mixtures so that you\n have just the right number of each type of atom to fully react and release the most energy possible. So I want to test how long it takes for fire to burn down about a meter of this homemade gunpowder. Let's let it rip. There it goes.\n Hey, it's going so slow. Come on, you can do it. Go, go, go, go.\n go! Wow it made it to the end. You know what I think the problem is? The granules of charcoal that I've got and these grains of potassium nitrate even the sulfur they're all a bit big so to actually\n get that reaction to happen fast it's not not really working. So what I want to do is compare that to store-bought gunpowder from you know a factory that's actually ground up all those particles to be really tiny so all the reagents\n are really close together. Oh my! That is impressive!\n The chemical reaction that occurs in the combustion of gunpowder is complicated, to say the least. But a number of the products formed\n The thing about gunpowder is if you burn it when it's just exposed to the air,\n It doesn't really explode and I think of gunpowder as explosive, but in order to see that what you have to do is confine it. Because when you confine gunpowder, you increase the concentration of all the reagents. They don't just blow away from each other when they catch fire.\n forced into closer proximity so they react more. Plus, you trap more of the heat, so the reagents get moving faster, they have more energy, and so they can react more readily. So I put 10 grams of gunpowder in a cardboard tube\n tube, and taped it shut. Okay, that's better, but it wasn't as big of a bang as I was hoping for. Oh, it was a bit more of a pop than a bang. Maybe we need a tighter vessel, I think. So I'm gonna use some fiber\n Reinforced tape to strengthen the container and then we should get a bigger bang It's more of a bang that's a bit more like it here I have twenty\n grams of black powder. So I guess the question is with twice the black powder do we get twice the bang? Here we go. Everyone get back.\n This is essentially what a firework is. I mean, fireworks consist of a shell with a lot of gunpowder inside. So this is an inert shell. It's colorized so that you can see the individual pieces better. A real shell, everything\n in here would be black because it would be primed or covered with black powder. Actually, a note about terminology. For a long time the terms gunpowder and black powder were used interchangeably. But these days the formula for gunpowder has changed to make it smokeless.\n So what's used in fireworks is called, at least in the US, black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless gunpowder. Just know that in this video we'll use both terms to mean basically the same thing. The shell itself is made out of cardboard\n and what looks like and is a form of paper mache with craft paper and a glue and you go around and around once you put the two shell halves together. Is that like the standard size you'd see when you go out? So on a 4th of July display you'll see anything\n from 2.5 inch up to 5 inch typically. In most cases, 6 inch and above are reserved for locations that you have a huge property, you're out in some desert shoot site or on a barge somewhere, but they can go even bigger than this.\n up to 12 inch, 16, and even larger in very special occasions. This is the hemisphere for a 16 inch diameter aerial shell. That is a huge firework. The biggest aerial firework ever was 1.44 meters wide and\n And it weighed about the same as a car. To launch a firework into the air, the way it's done is with more black powder.\n In a typical shell you're going to have a baggie of black powder that's underneath the shell and that acts to fire the shell out of the mortar to the 800 feet in the air which is what this 8 inch shell would go to. Shells as large as say a 16 inch those can use literally pounds of\n black powder underneath them. To ensure the shell goes straight up, it's placed in a big plastic tube called a mortar. A pyrotechnician gets two bangs for every one the audience does. You get a bang when the mortar fires and then a bang\n when the shell explodes. It's literally like a cannon shooting a cannonball in the air so the audience doesn't get to hear or see or feel that but the pyro crew does.\n Does everything burn up before it reaches\n the ground. The internal contents, yes, all the stars, the burst, all of that stuff. The casing will come down in pieces. That's why we have a fallout zone, what we call it, or the exclusion zone where only the crew is allowed with all their PPEs because you do get debris that comes\n down. It literally sounds like rain at the end from all of the debris from the finale shells going off all at once. How often do they malfunction? It's rare but it does happen. You'll have a wooden rack with a few\n HDPE high-density polyethylene mortars in it and that particular material is meant to expand and split from the energy of a malfunctioning shell versus explode and throw shrapnel everywhere. We actually experienced an\n incident like this with the biggest shell we had set to launch.\n That's what happens when a firework doesn't lift. But because we follow all the rules and regulations at a professional display, it's usually the crowd going, whoa, and the crew going, whoa. Oh my god.\n Thankfully, everyone was safe because we could trigger the fireworks remotely from outside the blast radius. But igniting explosives\n safely has long been a challenge. The simplest fuse just consists of\n cotton string that's been soaked in black powder and then allowed to dry out. This is known as black match. It burns well, but pretty slowly. That alone would burn two to three seconds an inch, but once you encase it in craft paper,\n That's literally all this is. You change that burn rate from a couple seconds an inch to anywhere from 30 to 100 feet a second. This has the same effect as containing the black powder. It traps in the heat and reagents so the reaction goes much faster. This is actually\n how we shoot our finale so fast. We're not actually pushing buttons that quickly. This type of fuse is appropriately known as quick match. Now before I'd ever seen quick match in action, it was suggested that I try to race the signal down the fuse.\n What I'm gonna do is light this little piece of black match right here And I'm gonna try to race the signal to the other end but still I was not prepared for what came next Jesus what the heck was that?\n The force of the combustion products caused\n causes the quick match to whip around wildly. It's crazy how much just containing the reagents and containing the heat from the reaction accelerates it. It certainly burns much faster than the black match without the paper.\n Man, every time, every time that gets me. One problem with these basic fuses is they aren't waterproof. Even though they contain the fuel and the oxidizer, so they\n don't need the oxygen in the air to burn, they do need heat. And water is just too good at conducting the heat away from the fuse so it snuffs out the reaction. And I fizzle that. The same problem occurs with road flares.\n I thought since the flame comes out with such high pressure, it might be able to stay lit underwater. Three, two, one. And it did for a\n a little while, but eventually the water got in there and stole the heat. So I think that the water is putting it out by pulling the heat away from it so it doesn't have enough energy to keep burning.\n Bring it out. Come on, come on. Ah. Wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey. Woo. And.\n There are special flares made for underwater applications, but even those have similar problems.\n You can see the gaseous combustion products being released here and bubbling to the surface. And while this flare lasted longer, the water still eventually put it out. Come on, why did that go out? But it is possible\n to make a waterproof fuse. So this is your traditional VSCO fuse. You're going to see this in a lot of your consumer fireworks. Very big fireworks, sir.\n I feel like we have to get this. Spins? And it's fire? I'm excited about this one. Here we\n Here we go, in three, two, one. It's really got a powder core with a fiber wrap to it.\n And it's typically lacquer coated, so these fuses are typically waterproof.\n Wow! That was impressive! Fuses are not only used to light fireworks,\n They are a core component inside\n to give you the time delay from the time the lift charge fires to the time the shell hits apogee and explodes in the sky. You know, it's about a quarter inch in diameter and is really a black powder core, rigid fuse compared to the more flimsy VSCO type.\n It's really important that the time delay fuse keeps the combustion contained inside it so the firework only explodes when you want it to, at the very peak of its trajectory. So we tested it underwater. What do you think? Is it waterproof? Should be. Alright.\n It's taking its time. There we go That looks like a firework type fuse These function by not spitting any fire out the side so that the shell doesn't get lit prematurely So I should only see it spit out the end once it's made its own\n all the way through. What's containing it? Like, what kind of material is containing it? Well, there's a number, there's, there's weaves of fibers in there and a layer of asphalt that really provides that waterproofing. So you can kind of see how the signal is progressing. You can see how the fire is progressing through there.\n So obviously it's getting hot some of the gaseous products are coming up. Oh Is it gonna come out? Was that it that was it That is all that is needed to ignite\n ignite the core of a firew that time fuse hits its a piece of black match tha into the burst charge. So by this blue material, whi holes or something simila\n coated with black powder. What are rice hulls? Yes, rice hulls, not holes, sorry. I was like, they're making rice hulls, like donut hulls. The reason we coat rice hulls is because you get a very granular powder in the center of the shell now, which allows the flame\n to propagate very quickly through the shell, igniting everything simultaneously, creating that significant overpressure very quickly to blow the shell open. So a traditional peony shell would be your most basic of fireworks where these stars\n would literally be lining the hemisphere and then you'd have your burst in the middle and that would give you a very symmetrical round sphere in the sky your traditional firework that you see. But it's just interesting to think that when you see a firework go off you\n You know, all those little points of light are about that size. But they look, I mean, I would say that they look bigger, right? Because they're so bright, I guess. So fast. How fast does this thing go?\n pretty quick and it is definitely trickier when it's dark like this. Okay, can you see anything? Once I go start looking here, I'm like, I'm not sure. How do you get focused to something that's not there yet and you're not quite sure where it is or where anything is because it's\n all pitch black. Because I basically have locked the exposure on this. We can at least see how the exposure is. Yes! Amazing!\n Blue. Oh shoot. Okay, FPV is down. Oh dang, I didn't realize I was so close to the ground. All right, hold on. I just want to see what this looks like, you know.\n These stars are made of black powder mixed with chemicals to give them different properties.\n crown star would be the big bushy gold tail that you would see in the sky so imagine a big glittering gold shell. I could actually see the little pieces coming off and glowing pretty bright. Now imagine those\n leaving a tail as they fly through the sky. It's a really spectacular effect. This is gonna be blue. Often the chemicals mixed into the stars are used to create specific colors. Each of\n these stars would be coated with a primer composition which is a really fine black powder. The reason for that is a lot of color compositions take more heat to ignite so they have a higher ignition temperature. So by coating with black powder with that\n primer, you're ensuring ignition of all the stars, which then transfer the fire to that color composition. And then it started taking off on you. That's cool. I like that.\n Jesus, it's bright. The colors of fireworks are actually thanks to quantum mechanics. An element absorbs energy from the combustion, raising an electron to a\n higher energy level. And there are only certain transitions which are allowed, so when the electron drops back down to a lower energy level, it gives off light with the specific energy of that transition, which corresponds to a particular color. Some elements are particularly\n well suited to create certain colors. So as the copper ions go in there, they absorb energy from the fire, from the combustion, and then the electrons drop back down to a lower energy level and they give out that blue light predominantly and that's why we get such a great\n blue color. What a thing of beauty. This is just a little interjection because I was looking at our flame tests and the copper salt tests, you know, anywhere you look, copper fireworks are meant to be blue, like bright blue, but those flame tests look kind\n of green and so I didn't really know what was going on but I was sitting here playing with my kids with the KiwiCo flame test kit. I know like they did sponsor this video but didn't tell me to put a section like this in but what I found is that okay I'm using\n a copper salt here and it starts out green and then if you leave it for a while come zoom in here it starts to get blue oh look at look at that blue to get the beautiful blue color i think you need more\n heat. I think it's a higher temperature that we need that we didn't achieve in our flame tests out in the field. Here we got some calcium chloride. Oh yeah. Oh that is a beautiful orange. Look at that. Here we're getting\n some potassium chloride to give us some violet. I'm not seeing too much violet but maybe just a little. Ferrium chloride. Of course that's just small scale.\n Our pyrotechnician mixed up some color salt and fuel in a mortar. What's in there is about two gallons of methanol with boric acid on this one and copper two chloride.\n 3, 2, 1, FIRE! Yeah! That was awesome! That is the beauty of quantum mechanics. The electron transitions that give rise to the color of fireworks\n are, at least in my opinion, way cooler than colored smoke bombs. So the combustion products here are solid, that's why they make so much smoke. In this case, there's just dye in the smoke to give it its color.\n To make so-called ghost shells, the stars are coated in layers of different chemicals, which allows them to change color mid-flight. So assuming your shell construction was very uniform,\n your casing, all your stars are the same mass, you're going to get a very uniform explosion in the sky so it's really as simple as how you lay out the stars in the shell and it'll break in that pattern in the sky. So what's your favorite\n Jellyfish are pretty neat. If you've ever seen a jellyfish, it really looks like a jellyfish. You get the dome and then you get tentacles coming out the bottom. That sounds amazing. Do they just do it by changing the color and position of the starfish?\n stars up here? Like how do you get a dome and then tentacles? If this was the shell and you'd have another half this way, only the top half would be covered and that would be your dome and then you'd have a couple larger stars to create the large tentacles that come out the bottom.\n These days, fireworks aren't usually triggered by lighting a fuse by hand, but by pushing a button. Each one of these buttons would correspond to an individual firing circuit going out into the field. The button sends current down the wire to an electric match. A little filament in the match heats up.\n triggering a chemical reaction. Which then spits fire into whatever you're trying to light. Yeah, I think it's just... Dust in the motors? I think so. This might be a pretty quick repair.\n We are about to have a fireworks finale in the middle of nowhere in the pitch dark for like a minute and we're gonna try to fly FPV drone through it so\n what does it actually look like to be in the middle where all the fireworks are exploding. In three, two, one.\n Thank you.\n I'm gonna go to the other side.\n I'm going to try to get the best shot possible.\n Wow! Can we get some light on the ground here? That was insane! The fireworks finale triggered my car alarm. They were like two times for\n I was like, I'm not sure if I'm upside down or not, but I got to hold this shot. Okay, so we're up in there here. Whoa. Oh, man.\n Right through them, right around them. Right down into them. Whoa! That is so weird. Dude! Yeah! There we go.\n You're upside down. Right there I was like, I got too excited.

If their purpose is to banish bad spirits, I'd say they achieve it.\n Hey, this video was sponsored by KiwiCo. You know, every time a KiwiCo crate shows up at our\n house my kids get really excited. What is it guys? I love this one. You light it on fire and it makes different color flames. The different chemicals you put on? Uh huh.\n they know what's inside is a hands-on project that they get to build with me. And the building is a lot of fun and playing with it afterwards is even better. From my perspective, the best part is that my kids are learning about science, technology, engineering, and design\n design, while playing and having fun, and I think that is the best way to learn. So the way it works is that each month KiwiCo delivers a crate right to your door, and inside is everything you need to complete the project, and I mean everything.\n there are no additional trips to the store. We've been getting crates for three years now, so we've built lots of different projects, and they are all high quality. I got to tour KiwiCo's headquarters, so I saw how their crates are designed by experts and then tested with\n kids before they're ever sent out. They are also really good value. Most KiwiCo subscriptions work out to around $20 per month. They have nine different product lines targeted at different age groups, everything from newborns up to 14 plus. So your\n Kids can grow with KiwiCo just as mine have. I think my favorite thing is that working on these projects has become something that we do together. Every month there is this thought starter and an invitation to spend some quality time together and it just\n on our doorstep and I really appreciate that. So if you want to try it out go to KiwiCo.com slash Veritasium to get your first month free. Using my link you're not only getting a great deal you're also helping to support this channel. And if you want to purchase\n single crates that's also an option through the KiwiCo store. They make great gifts. So I want to thank KiwiCo for sponsoring this video and I want to thank you for watching."

So for example, water only boils at 100 degrees Celsius if the pressure is one atmosphere.\n So if you reduce the pressure, then those water molecules that are going quite quickly can easily escape from the water if there's no pressure pushing down on them. So you can get water to boil at room temperature. This is really boiling water.

            "transcription": "Here are some facts about great white sharks. White sharks are live birthed, usually in litters of between four and seven individuals. Now they're called pups, but when they're born they're between 1.2 and\n and 1.5 meters. So that's a pretty big baby. It takes a great white shark about 10 to 12 years to reach maturity, at which point the females are actually about a meter longer than the males. The larger\n recorded being over six meters roughly the size of this red boat behind me. At this length they'd weigh about two to three thousand kilograms. Oh man. Now there are stories of some great whites being over seven meters but those are\n They're unsubstantiated. White sharks are warm bodied. They're not warm blooded like us. They can't maintain a perfectly stable temperature. But their internal organs are kept at up to 13 degrees above the average\n temperature of the ambient water around them. The heat generated by their muscles is actually transferred to the blood in their veins as it returns from the shark's extremities so it warms it up and keeps the core temperature a little bit hotter. This allows the shark to venture into\n colder waters and also to have explosive power. Its muscles work a lot better when warm than when cold just like ours. The trade off is the shark requires about ten times as much energy as if it didn't heat its body and that's why they need to feed on these blubber\n rich seals and whale carcasses. White sharks like to hunt when it's light out because they use their eyesight to spot their prey. But when they open their jaws, their eyes actually roll back into their head to protect them and\n And so they're actually blind when they're taking a bite. Now they do like conditions that are a little bit low visibility because they rely on stealth to track down their prey. If a seal spots them coming, it's basically game over because the seal is so much more maneuverable and can definitely get away\n the shark. But they only eat sea mammals after they're about 2.5 meters long, which is why most of the sharks we're seeing around here are quite large. Before that, their diet consists mainly of fish. The gestation period is thought to be about 18\n months and that leads to a two to three year reproduction cycle and with such small litters that means it takes a long time for this shark population to recover. There are a couple misconceptions about great white sharks one is that they can't\n get cancer. And that's led to a lot of people hunting them down and trying to use their fins as an anti-cancer soup. But in reality, sharks get cancer just like anything else, and there's photographic evidence of sharks with big tumors. So it makes no sense to hunt down sharks as a\n cancer remedy because they get cancer just like we do. Another misconception is sharks are coastal creatures that just cruise the beaches waiting to bite people. In reality, the sharks spend much of their time way, way out at sea.\n sea and very deep, over a kilometer deep. It's kind of shocking, but we've only found this out in the last couple of years, so there's so much about sharks that remains undiscovered.

Goodness out of the soil, I suppose.\n comes out of the soil. Yeah. Goodness. Goodness. Why isn't there a big hole around the tree where it's taken out all the soil? Because it does it so gradually that the soil has time to recover. Now I think it's intuitive to believe\n that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots digging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not\n In the early 1600s, a scientist named Johann Baptiste van Hemholt tried to figure out where the mass of a tree was coming from. So he got a pot of soil and very carefully measured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and took care of it for\n five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot. And at the end of this experiment he weighed the tree to find that it was 72 kilograms but the mass of soil had only decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty\n strong evidence that the mass of the tree does not come from the soil.\n Presumably from the water and the nutrients from the soil. Is there anything else that you need besides the soil and the water? It's got a bit of a leaf isn't it? Other than the original seed for that particular tree.\n the seed and the soil and the water and that makes this big tree. Of course, Johan Baptiste van Hemholt did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now, while that's not correct, at least he was on the right track, realizing that the matter of a tree doesn't come out of the soil.\n The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy? Yeah. Are they converting energy into maths? Or... Do you know what I mean? Yeah, I don't know. Like there wasn't stuff and then there was. Like where did that stuff come from? Magic. I don't know.\n My question is where do they get that mass to grow big? Sun. From the rain and the sun presumably. Light. Sunlight. And the sunshine. The sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree?\n tree. Well, yes, it wouldn't, they wouldn't grow without it. I don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't grow without it. Of course, the Sun's energy is needed for the tree to build\n the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself the energy is not matter.\n oxygen the trees need the oxygen and I guess oxygen the oxygen of course the oxygen are there any ingredients that we're missing\n Carbon dioxide carbon dioxide carbon dioxide so what it surprised you to find out that 95% of a tree is actually coming up from carbon dioxide Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah Yeah\n So as it turns out, trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe out carbon dioxide in water, that's how we lose mass.\n But it's the exact same substances that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system where it was just you and a tree, you would breathe out that carbon dioxide and water, the tree would take it in, so you would get smaller while the tree\n is getting bigger. And in a sense, you're becoming the tree."

Some things look the same, but generally it's hazier, sometimes light and dark are flipped, skin looks blotchier, and fake teeth? Standing.\n out.\n But the idea for this video started a long time ago with a question I had which is how does non-ionizing radiation like ultraviolet light damage skin and lead to cancer? I do like to tell people that if you want to see how good your skin could look, look at your butt.\n When I thought about what UV light must be doing to our cells and our DNA, I imagined it would be getting in there and breaking all these bonds and that's\n would be the problem. But in fact it's kind of the opposite. UV actually facilitates the formation of covalent bonds in our DNA that shouldn't be there. It comes in and it kind of creates these unauthorized bonds between the bases.\n Called primidine dimers instead of having them bonded across it bonds the one next to each other if that makes sense Oh, yeah, so what happens is two thymines which are side-by-side can actually get covalently bonded together and that creates a lesion on the DNA\n You can think of it like a little bump that makes the DNA hard to read and work with.\n UV has other effects on the body, like it suppresses the\n immune system. So as Haley says, it's a double whammy.\n UV light also causes us to visibly age.\n photo aging. I should clear up a misconception here that I had which was I thought glass blocks all ultraviolet light so I thought if you're inside a car for example you really don't need to put on sunscreen because you're not being exposed to UV light. The car does not block UVA.\n glass. It does block most UVB, but you're still susceptible to those sunspots and those wrinkles through the glass. And a lot of my patients, if you look and you compare their hands, the left is more wrinkled or has more sunspots on it because\n they're driving. So they're sticking that hand out there. Truckers absolutely you can see it the worst and there's a really famous picture of someone whose left side of their face is significantly more as we would call like photo age or old-looking than the other side of their\n So that's mostly UVA and UVA as I said it's a longer wavelength penetrates a little bit deeper. So wrinkles mostly come from destruction of our collagen and elastin which is natural fibers that hold up the scaffolding of our skin.\n So with age, the cells that secrete collagen, they're called fibroblasts, they stop producing as much. And what the sun does is it breaks down the existing collagen and elastin we have. So fibroblasts really like to be stretched. They like to be pulled.\n And collagen does that, that collagen matrix. So the sun damages the collagen fibers, leading to less stretch on fibroblasts and less production of collagen. Which means that we look a little more saggy. I know, it's very depressing.\n sun protection helps the degradation of those collagen and elastin fibers. You know there are a lot of creams on the market that claim to be anti-aging but the one that really works is sunscreen. Preventing ultraviolet\n light from hitting your skin is the best thing you can do to avoid skin cancer and to avoid photo aging. So yeah, it's good advice. Use sunscreen.\n Hey, I'm on set for Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and I'm here filming Sci-Fi Test Lab where we try to recreate some dinosaur parts out of machinery and test them out.

            "transcription": "There is a misconception about chameleons that they change their color in order to blend in with their environment. That is actually not the case. When a chameleon is calm, it is green, and so it naturally blends in with its leafy\n surroundings. But male chameleons change color when they become excited in the presence of a female or a rival male, as shown here. I'll put the first frame in the bottom right for comparison. As you can see, as he becomes more excited, his color\n changes to be more yellow, orange, and red. So instead of blending in, this chameleon will now stand out. But how do chameleons actually change their color? For years we thought that there was a simple, well-established mechanism for this\n color change. In their skin, chameleons have different cells containing colored pigments. Some are yellow, others are red, and some contain the dark melanin pigment. Many animals, including chameleons, are known to turn a darker shade by\n causing the melanin to spread out along the fingery extensions of the cell. They turn lighter again by condensing the pigment back into one spot. It was assumed that chameleons must turn yellow, orange, and red in the same way, by causing those pigments to spread out\n in those cells. But new research from collaborating groups of physicists and biologists at the University of Geneva shows that this is incorrect. Now the first clue should come from the fact that there is actually no green pigment in a chameleon. The green\n Color is actually created by two distinct mechanisms, pigment color and structural color. Beneath the yellow pigment cells, there are cells containing tiny 130 nanometer crystals, regularly arranged in a lattice. Now light diffracts off\n these crystals and due to the spacing between them, blue light constructively interferes and is therefore strongly reflected, whereas the other colors are not reflected. This is very similar to how a morpho butterfly wing creates an iridescent blue. There is\n There's no blue pigment, just the periodic nanoscale structure that acts as a strong reflector for only one color. So a chameleon looks green due to the combination of the yellow light from the pigment plus the blue light reflected off the crystal structure beneath it.\n So how do chameleons change this green into yellow, orange, and red? Well, previously it was assumed that the color change was achieved by dispersing pigments in the colored cells. But now scientists have found it's actually the crystals underneath which are changing.\n By increasing the spacing between the crystals, the chameleons can change which color is selectively reflected. Bigger gaps between the crystals are better at reflecting longer wavelengths, so as the spacing increases, the color changes.\n from blue to green to yellow and then orange and red. Scientists compared skin samples from calm green chameleons and excited yellow chameleons and found that indeed in the excited chameleon the crystal spacing\n was much further apart. Here you can see a single cell enlarged and the color it reflects changing from blue to green to yellow, orange and red. Plus a computer simulation of the light reflected off crystals while\n their spacing is decreasing also provides excellent agreement with these observations. Furthermore, applying physical pressure to the skin causes the crystals to compress and so they reflect more blue light. When that pressure is removed, the crystals expand\n The structure of a chameleon's skin gets even more fascinating, as there is another layer of cells underneath which also contain crystals. But these crystals are larger, more spaced out, and more disorganized.\n This means they reflect longer wavelengths in the infrared part of the spectrum and they reflect a broader range of these wavelengths. It's thought that the function of this layer could be to reflect heat from the Sun since these chameleons live in bright full Sun habitat.\n So male chameleons don't change their color hue by spreading out red and yellow pigments. Instead, they do something much more remarkable. They actively tune the spacing between nanoscale crystals in order to create structural color\n that span the whole length of the visible spectrum. Now what I find amazing is that in this day and age, we thought we had the answer to how chameleons change color, but it actually took the combined expertise of physicists and biologists working together to figure out what's wrong.\n really going on?\n ranging from video production to web development and computer programming.

            "transcription": "Inside each one of your cells there is 6 feet of DNA made up of 6 billion letters of genetic code. Now your DNA is split into 46 pieces each 3 to 4 centimeters long called chromium.\n So, usually, DNA is just a wiggly thread within the nucleus. Now, if you can imagine, DNA is only about 2 nanometers wide, but a chromosome is sent to the nucleus.\n centimeters long, so you would think that it would get tangled worse than the headphones in your bag. So the DNA is actually wrapped around proteins called histones. Now those histones have wiggly tails which will come in handy as we'll see\n in a moment.\n So two X chromosomes make you female and an X and a Y make you male. Now since the male sex chromosomes are different, both can remain active for the rest of your life. But for females, one of the X chromosomes needs to be inactivated in order for\n the\n one of the X chromosomes wins and remains active, while the other is inactivated. This is done by packing the DNA closer together, and making modifications to those dangly histone tails that signal this inactivation.\n New structural proteins are also added to bind everything closer together. And finally, methyl groups, these tiny little molecular markers are added to the DNA to basically signal to the cell that this DNA shouldn't be red. So all of this together makes the\n DNA very difficult to access for the molecular machinery that would harness the code in this DNA. It is switched off, this DNA is silenced. In contrast, the active X chromosome DNA is more spread out. This allows better access to\n the genes on the chromosome. Histones can be slid along the DNA or removed entirely.\n And histone tails have a different modification signaling this DNA is active. Now all of this makes it possible for RNA polymerase to access and transcribe this DNA into messenger RNA which then goes out into\n to\n embryo ends up with a mixture of active X chromosomes. But from this point forward, as these cells divide, they maintain the active X chromosome that they had inside. So all of the cells with dad's active X chromosome give rise to further cells\n with dad's active X chromosome and this continues on into adulthood. So if you could look at a woman's skin and see which X chromosome has been inactivated, you would see a stripy pattern which shows the growth and migration\n of all of these first 100 cells when the embryo was just four days old. Now of course you can actually see that in humans.\n But you can see this with calico cats and that's because the gene for coat color is actually on the X chromosome So just by looking at the pattern of her spots here her dark and light spots You can see where her mom or dad's X chromosome has been\n and activated. And this also shows us that only female cats can be calico cats. And that's because, well, only female cats can inherit two X chromosomes with two different color genes. Now this is just one really cool example\n of epigenetics. But epigenetics doesn't normally work on one whole chromosome. In fact, it's at play in all of your chromosomes turning on and off your genes. For example, it's epigenetics which makes a pancreatic cell capable of producing insulin.\n because that gene is switched on there, but switched off everywhere else. What's more interesting is that it seems the behaviors you take can actually affect your epigenetics. And even weirder, perhaps the things that your parents or grandparents did\n can affect your epigenetics now, can affect your DNA. So you are not just a product of your genetic code, you're not just a product of your DNA, you are also a product of your epigenetics. And that is influenced by your behavior and the behavior of your DNA.\n ancestors.\n you"

            "transcription": "These are tiny molecular machines and they are doing this inside your body right now. To understand why we have to zoom out.\n Every day in an adult human body, 50 to 70 billion of your cells die. Either they're stressed or damaged or just old. But this is normal. In fact, it's called programmed cell death. But to make up for all these lost cells,\n right now billions of your cells are dividing, essentially creating new cells. And that process of cell division, also called mitosis, well it requires an army of tiny molecular machines. So let's take a closer look.\n DNA is a good place to start, the double helix molecule we always talk about. This is a scientifically accurate depiction of DNA created by Drew Barry at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. If you unwind the two strands, you can see that each has a\n sugar phosphate backbone connected to the sequence of nucleic acid base pairs known by the letters A, T, G, and C. Now the strands run in opposite directions which is important when you go to copy DNA. Copying DNA is one of the first steps in cell division.\n Here, the two strands of DNA are being unwound and separated by the tiny blue molecular machine called helicase. Helicase literally spins as fast as a jet engine.\n The strand of DNA on the right has its complementary strand assembled continuously, but the other strand is more complicated because it runs in the opposite direction. So it must be looped out with its complementary strand assembled in reverse, section by section.\n At the end of this process, you have two identical DNA molecules, each one a few centimeters long, but just a couple nanometers wide. So to prevent the DNA from becoming a tangled mess, it is wrapped around proteins called histones,\n forming a nucleosome. These nucleosomes are bundled together into a fiber known as chromatin, which is further looped and coiled to form a chromosome, one of the largest molecular structures in your body.\n Thanks for watching!\n You can actually see chromosomes under a microscope in dividing cells. Only then do they take on their characteristic shape. Otherwise the DNA is more strewn inside the nucleus.\n The process of dividing a cell takes around an hour in mammals, so this footage is from a time-lapse. You can see how the chromosomes line up on the equator of the cell. Now when everything is right,\n They are pulled apart into the two new daughter cells each one containing an identical copy of DNA Now simple as this looks the process is incredibly complicated and requires even more fascinating molecular machines to accomplish\n So let's look at a single chromosome. One chromosome consists of two sausage-shaped chromatids, containing the identical copies of DNA made earlier. Each chromatid is attached to microtubule fibers, which guide and help align the DNA.\n The microtubules are connected to the chromatid at the kinetochore, here colored red. The kinetochore consists of hundreds of different proteins working together to achieve multiple objectives. In fact, it's one of the most sophisticated molecular mechanisms in the world.\n The kinetochore is central to the successful separation of the chromatids. It creates a dynamic connection between the chromosome and the microtubules. For a reason no one's yet been able to figure out, the microtubules are called chromatids.\n constantly being built at one end and deconstructed at the other. While the chromosome is still getting ready, the kinetochore sends out a chemical stop signal to the rest of the cell, shown here by the red molecules, basically saying this chromosome is not yet ready to divide.\n The kinetochore also mechanically senses tension. When the tension is just right and the position and attachment are correct, all the proteins get ready, shown\n here by turning green. At this point, the stop signal broadcasting system is not switched off. Instead, it is literally carried away from the kinetic core down the microtubules by a dynein motor. That's the walking guy. This is really\n what it looks like. It has long legs so it can avoid obstacles and step over the kinesins, molecular motors that walk in the opposite direction. Personally, I'm astounded by these tiny molecular machines. How they're\n able to routinely and faithfully execute their functions billions of times over inside your body at this exact instant. I'm also amazed by the scientists who were able to work out how this happens in such detail that we could create real\n depictions of them like you saw in the animations in this video. But perhaps the most amazing thing is just how much is left to be discovered, like figuring out how exactly the chromatids are pulled to opposite ends of the cell. There is still so much that we don't quite\n No. You know what I find exciting is that in science fiction for decades we've been writing about tiny nanobots that will be injected into our bloodstreams that can heal us. But what this suggests, the existence of these tiny molecular machines inside us, it suggests\n that there isn't a physical limit that would prevent that. And so I think it's pretty likely that in future we will be able to develop our own tiny molecular machines that will be able to repair our bodies better than they can repair themselves.\n you\n you"

            "transcription": "I remember when I was a kid waiting an hour for my favorite TV show to come on, which was Sharon, Lois, and Bram, that felt like eternity. But as I've gotten older, everything seems to have sped up. Time is going much faster.\n But why is this? Is it just an illusion, or are there good scientific reasons why time appears to go faster as we get older?\n Geographic channel's Brain Games, a show that explores the inner workings of the human mind through experiments and interactive games to test out some theories about why this actually occurs. There is a reasonable sounding argument that says each year goes faster because it makes up a smaller\n fraction of your entire life. This graph shows one year as a percentage of your life at each age.\n But what I find weird about this is if you add up the area underneath the curve You'll find that you've already lived half of the total by age six So I really don't think this is how our brains perceive time. You really think that like a day now? Of course\n I think there are better reasons why time appears to speed up as we get older So I've come to Venice Beach to find two groups of people the older and younger to see if their perceptions of time differ so what I want to do is I want to\n Set my timer going and without counting, you tell me when you think a minute is up. Let's go. Start. Okay. Everywhere around the world when this experiment is performed, older people typically overestimate while younger people measure it quite accurately. Alright, probably stop. Yep.\n Whoa One minute two seconds a minute and two seconds a minute and five as we get older the rate at which our neurons fire or our neuron conduction velocity it decreases and you can think of this firing rate a little bit like a\n internal clock. And so if our internal clock is slowing down, that would make everything else, external time, seem to be speeding up. I'm gonna tell you the time. Now? One minute. That's it? That was one minute? One minute.\n 17 seconds. Not bad, right? Not bad. I thought I'd be a lot closer actually, but I guess I wasn't. Do you want to know what it really was? One minute forty-seven. No way, it was almost two minutes. It was almost two minutes. It really is amazing how fast time flies by, it really is.\n Our sense of time, or chronoception, is not like one of the standard five senses. It has no specialized receptor cells, and it does not appear to be localized in just one part of the brain. Perhaps this suggests that it's not one coherent thing at all.\n But it does seem that our perception of time is very fundamental. Studies of rats have shown that even with their neocortex removed, that is the higher order thinking part of their brains, they are still able to learn how to time 40 seconds accurately.\n That's quite remarkable and it suggests our sense of time evolved early and is one of the fundamental functions of the brain. But that doesn't mean our brains always represent time faithfully. For example, have you noticed that really good movies seem to go by much faster than they\n actually are? Or do you notice that your vacations fly by? There are good reasons for this. When we're focused on something, we don't notice the time is passing, and that makes them feel in the moment shorter than they actually are. At its best, this results\n in a mental state called flow. This can happen when playing sports or video games or artists when they're fully engrossed in their work or people meditating. So I would argue another reason time speeds up as we age is because we are more often engrossed\n in what we're doing. Another thing that appears to make time speed up is repetition. I'm going to show you a series of images and I want you to consider how long each one appears on the screen. Are you ready? Go!\n So which one appeared to last the longest? If you're like most people, you'd probably say the dog. But all of those images actually appeared on screen for the same length of time. The dog seemed longer because it was novel and therefore your brain had to invest more energy in processing it.\n What's remarkable is that our sense of how long something is, or subjective duration, it correlates highly with how much energy we're using in our brains. Now, if you study how much energy people use in their brains over the course of their lifetime, you'll find that it peaks around a\n If you think about it, this kind of makes sense because when you're a kid, almost everything is novel to you and therefore your brain needs to use more energy, fully 66% of your resting energy intake. That's used by the brain because of all of the novel experiences.\n And that must at least in part explain why time appears to go more slowly. So what can we do to slow time down? Well, studies have shown that being afraid increases our perception of time. When a radical\n Arachnophobes were forced to stare at spiders for 45 seconds. Yes, this is a real experiment. Those arachnophobes judged that experience as lasting much longer than 45 seconds as you'd kind of expect. Plus, experiments involving skydivers or people\n people falling show that they judge their experience to last much longer than it actually is. Another time when time appears to pass slowly is when you're bored. You know when you're waiting and waiting that's all you think about so it seems like time drags forever.\n there is so little to focus on, you are acutely aware of just how much time is passing, and so these boring moments drag on and on. So if you really want to slow down your experience of time, you could scare yourself, take up extreme sports, get into accidents, and\n intersperse all of that with periods of boredom. But this viewpoint ignores one important fact, which is that we don't experience time as just one thing. We think about time as it passes, but also as it has passed before.\n when we remember it. And those two ways of looking at time, they don't align. So for example, holidays, they feel like they go by really fast, but when you think back upon them, they last a long time. That's because you had a lot of novel experiences\n and your brain formed a lot of memories. And it judges the duration of that vacation by the number of memories that were formed. All that novelty means lots of memories means it feels like it took a long time, but in the moment it felt fast. This is\n the paradox of our perception of time. If you want time to go slowly, there are a lot of things you can expose yourself to that will slow time down, but they won't necessarily be pleasant. So maybe the happiest life and the longest\n remembered life is one where time really seems to fly. It's like Einstein said put your hand on a stove for a minute and it'll feel like an hour but sit next to a pretty girl for an hour and it'll feel like a minute.\n So, what would you like your life to feel like?\n out their series Brain Games. The new season begins February 14th at 9, 8c. And this season they have an episode about all of your senses, including your sense of time, chronoception.

            "transcription": "Sometimes the simplest questions have the most amazing answers. Like, how can trees be so tall? It's a question that doesn't even seem like it needs an answer. Trees just are tall. Some of them are over a hundred meters.\n Why should there be a height limit? I'll tell you why. Trees need to transport water from their roots up into their topmost branches in order to survive. And that is no trivial task. There is a limit to the height that water can be sucked up a tube. It's 10 meters.\n If you suck on a long vertical straw, the water will go no higher than 10 meters. At this point there will be a perfect vacuum at the top of the straw and the water will start to boil spontaneously. For a tree to raise water 100 meters, it would have to create a pressure difference of 10\n atmospheres. How would trees do that? When I posed this conundrum, a lot of people said the answer is transpiration. And that's when water evaporates from the leaf, pulling up the water molecules behind it. And that's clearly a mechanism a tree can use to create\n suction, but it doesn't help us overcome this 10 meter limit. The lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum, which I imagine is not happening inside of tree leaves, right? Right, Hank. So you might suspect that a tree does not contain continuous straw-like tubes.\n The tree effectively has valves in it so you don't have a column of water. This big tube which you're saying needs to be filled with water is actually made up of cells. Although these are good speculations, they don't turn out to be correct. Scientists who study\n trees find that the xylem tubes that transport water do contain a continuous water column. So how else could the tree transport water from the roots to the leaves? They don't suck. They don't use a vacuum. Okay, so how do they do it? Squeezing like a cow, like you're squeezing a cow water all the\n Besides being a giant waste of energy, all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes are dead. What about osmotic pressure? If there is more solute in the roots than in the surrounding soil, water would be pushed up the tree.\n But some trees live in mangroves where the water is so salty that osmotic pressure actually acts in the other direction, so the tree needs additional pressure to suck water into the tree. Then it must be capillary action. The thinner the tube, the higher the water can climb.\n But the tubes in a tree are too wide. At 20 to 200 micrometers in diameter, water should rise less than a meter. So how do trees do it? Well, one of the assumptions we made is wrong. The lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum.\n In a gas, this is true. When you eliminate all of the gas molecules, the pressure is zero and you have a perfect vacuum. But in a liquid, you can go lower than zero pressure and actually get negative pressures. In a solid, we would think of this as\n tension. This means that the molecules are pulling on each other and their surroundings. As the water evaporates from the pores of the cell wall, they create immense negative pressures of minus 15 atmospheres in an average tree. Think about the\n air-water interface at the pore. There is one atmosphere of pressure pushing in and negative 15 atmospheres of suction on the other side. So why doesn't the meniscus break? Because the pores are tiny, only 2 to 5 nanometers in diameter.\n At this scale, water's high surface tension ensures the air-water boundary can withstand huge pressures without caving. As you move down the tree, the pressure increases up to atmospheric at the roots, so you can have a large pressure difference between the top and bottom of the tree.\n the top and the bottom of the tree because the pressure at the top is so negative. But hang on, if the pressure at the top is negative 15 atmospheres, shouldn't the water be boiling? Yes, yes it should. But changing phase from liquid to\n gas requires activation energy and that can come in the form of a nucleation site like a tiny air bubble. That's why it's so important that the xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and they can do this because unlike a straw they've been water filled from the start. This way water\n water remains in the metastable liquid state when it really should be boiling. It's just like supercooled water remains liquid even though it should be ice. So you could say that the water in a tree is super sucked because it remains liquid at such negative pressures.\n Why are trees moving all this water up the tree? I want you to make a guess. Say it out loud. For photosynthesis? Actually, no. Less than 1% of the water is used in photosynthetic reactions. Any other ideas? Okay, what about growth?\n 95% of the water is used to make new cells. So what happens to the other 95% of the water? It just evaporates. For each molecule of carbon dioxide the tree takes in, it loses hundreds of molecules of water. Can you believe how\n amazing this is? Trees create huge negative pressures of tens of atmospheres by evaporating water through nanoscale pores, sucking water up a hundred meters in a state where it should be boiling but can't because the perfect xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, just\n just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide. I will never look at trees the same way again.\n I'd like to say a huge thank you to Hank, Henry and Professor Poliakov for making on-camera hypotheses. This is an essential part of the scientific process, even if your hypothesis turns out to be\n wrong. As Einstein said, a person who's never made a mistake has never tried anything new. Now I'd be surprised if you weren't already subscribed to these guys, but if you're not, go\n Click on these annotations and check out their channels and you may just learn something. I'd also like to thank Professor John Sperry from the University of Utah. He walked me through all of this in an hour long Skype conversation. So I'm going to put a link to his website in the description. We're looking at pressures here below atmospheric.\n Is that right? That's right. This is liquid pressure, not gas pressure. So it's a common misconception that, oh, you can't have negative pressures because there's no molecules left. The definition of pure vacuum is\n zero molecules that's for gas okay so just just to be clear I think this was one of my big big problems in understanding this this video would have been impossible without CGP Grey when I told him about this idea in London and I felt like\n Mind just blown with this whole thing He said it was gonna be really hard to explain and you know when he says it's hard to explain You know things are gonna be tough So thank you for all your input to this script and thank you for watching making this video has been a real odyssey for me\n So thank you for joining me on that journey I really appreciate all of your comments and if you haven't subscribed to the channel already you can click the annotation or click the link above and Join me on my next scientific adventure I made a video\n thing to make a video about the answer to this I proposed the problem like right a couple months ago and I was like subscribe to the channel I'll give you the answer next week\n Right frequency.

            "transcription": "This is the largest body of water in California. It's about 25 kilometers wide by 55 kilometers long. You can't even see the other end of this lake.\n home to the most diverse number of birds anywhere in the continental US besides Big Bend in Texas. And here's the thing, this body of water is here by accident. Let me explain.\n Back in about the 1900s, there were engineers working on irrigating the fields of the American Southwest. They were using the water from the Colorado River, but they were also trying to prevent it from flooding, from flooding all this farmland.\n In 1905, they got it a little bit wrong and also the Colorado River flooded its banks and used the channels they were building basically to flood this whole plane. Now this plane is actually about 70 meters over\n 200 feet below sea level. We're at one of the lowest points in North America. So the water flooded in here, the entire volume of the Colorado River flooded into this plain for about two years before they were able to stop the flooding.\n And what you're left with is the lake that you can see today.\n The low-lying area where the Salton Sea now is was formed due to tectonic activity. We're very close to the San Andreas Fault. And that also means there's magma very close to the surface here. Sometimes that heat boils up through mud volcanoes like these.\n \uc544\n so\n We're actually taking advantage of this heat using seven geothermal plants which together generate enough electricity for over a hundred\n Now, initially people thought that this lake was just going to dry up. This is one of the hottest, driest parts of the country. But it didn't. The water didn't\n go away. And so then people got the idea that they would take advantage of this little accident and try to dress this whole place up like a new Riviera.\n And for a time it worked.\n In the 50s and 60s they started building towns here and resorts and celebrities came to this place and people would enjoy the water. They actually added fish to this lake and the fishing was so good you could throw in a hook and pull out a fish without even putting any bait on it.\n it. Of course there was lots of bird life and people really enjoyed themselves. It looked as though everything was going great. Until, well, the lake started to turn a little bit. You see, the only real\n inflows of water to this lake are from agricultural runoff and they bring salt into the lake and there is no outflow for this lake because it is so low it's already one of the lowest points in North America it's below sea level so all that happens\n is the water then evaporates, leaving the salt behind and the salinity of this water increases. It's now about 50 grams per liter, which is quite a bit more than seawater, and that makes it hard for the fish to survive, so there are massive\n fish die-offs which create quite a smell. It's a bit stinky over here. And algal blooms have also occurred making the water this ugly brown color. I wouldn't really want to go swimming in there. And the resorts have all closed up. There's only\n a few people left here. You know, when you drive around here you find those old resort areas, places where people thought, you know, it was going to be the next Riviera, and now they are deserted. Ghost towns and there's boats\n abandoned up on the shore. It's a kind of depressing place which is strange given the kind of natural beauty. Some people might think that letting this lake of\n evaporate is the right thing to do. It's the natural thing to do. It returns it to its state from before we accidentally flooded it back in 1905. But if you look back a bit further, you find that\n there really did used to be a lake here. A lake which came and went, but for the last several thousand years, the lake was here more often than it was not, and it was filled up to a higher level.\n This whole story makes me think two things. First, as humans we have incredible power to drastically shape the earth. We can cause entire seas to disappear.\n And we can create seas. And the other thing is that in the absence of effort, in the absence of our caring, things tend towards disorder. Things naturally fall apart.\n And I feel like if we don't do anything here, the natural result is going to be messy and ugly. I mean, if you just look around at what's happened to the towns that have been abandoned and the homes which are crumbling, it looks like a disaster area.\n It's as bad as Chernobyl, but there was no nuclear accident here. There's just a lack of caring. And I think this applies to more than just this sea. You know? We have\n this kind of duty to recognize what we do matters and if we don't care, if we don't put in the effort, it's not going to turn out very well. I think that's the lesson of the sultan's\n see.\n you\n you"

            "transcription": "Hey, this episode was sponsored by Head & Shoulders. 125 million years ago, in what is now China, dinosaurs walked the earth.\n species of small feathered dinosaurs climbed trees. This is Cynornithosaurus. Although they couldn't truly fly, they could glide, which helped them evade predators and catch prey. What makes these dinosaurs\n unique is how well preserved their fossils were.\n They're not just random bits of rock or broken bone or something, because they have a particular kind of cells within the structure which are just like the skin cells that we find in humans today. Well, my first thought when I saw these was this is dinosaur skin.\n So these dinosaurs may have had the first known case of dandruff, but it certainly wasn't\n Alas, our skin cells are constantly replenishing themselves. In fact, every second, 500 new skin cells are created. And as they move up through the outer layer of your skin, the epidermis, they flatten out and harden.\n they fall off one by one. In fact, over your lifetime you will shed about a hundred pounds of dead skin. But we don't really notice this because skin falls off in such tiny microscopic pieces. Except for some\n Some people, from some parts of the body, skin comes off in larger flakes, typically from the skin under the hair, the scalp. And this is what's known as dandruff. Now around half of everyone on earth suffers from it.\n There are actually a lot of scientists who study this condition and I'm flying to Cincinnati to Head and Shoulders headquarters to visit their lab. Okay. Do you need a break or something? No, it's funny, like, because I'm not really sure what I'm getting myself into, right?\n No. No. I am going to have my head swabbed. What is that all about? I mean this is something that you do to people all the time? Oh yeah, every day. You're gonna cotton swab my scalp. Yes. And we're\n We're looking for what? So we are going to be looking for the malassegia that is on your scalp. Okay, so what do I need to do? So I need you to have a seat here. Let's see.\n And I just put my head in here? Yeah, put your head face forward. Okay. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna part your hair. Mm-hmm. So now I'm gonna take my swab and I'm basically gonna grab off your scalp. Mm-hmm. So then what I do is I take this\n Malassezia\n Globosa is a fungus that lives on your scalp. It thrives in the warm, moist environment under your hair. And it is thought to be one of the causes of dandruff. So how did my swab come back? Well, I have my\n Malassezia living on my head.\n kind of like a bunch of grass. Now that I'm close to it and actually smell it, it smells like bread. Yeah, well, you know, it's a yeast, you know, it's a pre-living fungus just like the saccharomyces that are used to make bread and make beer.\n So could you make bread with this? Uh, no, I wouldn't want to make bread with the yeast off of your scalp. Not right now. Have you been tested? I've been tested, yes. And? What did it come out to? Um, I have a decent amount. So. But we all do.\n It's on everyone's head. It's on everyone's head as long as you have hair. Right. But if everyone has Malassezia, why do only half of us get dandruff? Well, Malassezia lives on the oils called sebum secreted by her skin. The fungus\n Angi release enzymes called lipases that break down fat molecules.\n scalp because it produces free fatty acids that irritate the scalp. For some of us, those molecules are perceived as invaders, if you will, and all the defensive forces that we have will get turned on to repel essentially\n One of the scalp's defenses is to speed up the turnover of skin cells, so instead of taking a month for skin\n cells to mature and reach the surface, they take as little as seven days. When they get to the surface, the adhesive function from one cell to the other hasn't been lost, and so they shed as these clumps of skin cells, three or four hundred together, which we see as a dandruff lake.\n The dandruff flakes are just an indicator of a fundamentally unhealthy scalp underlying it by any measure you can dream of making. Dandruff skin samples show elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines.\n But it goes even further than that, down to the level of gene expression.\n Scientists took swabs from healthy scalps and dandruff scalps and then they extracted the RNA, effectively markers of which genes are being expressed and how strongly. And then they compared the two groups and they found that there were nearly\n There were only 4,000 genes which were systematically either upregulated or downregulated in the dandruff scalps compared to the healthy scalps. For example, immune and inflammatory response genes were upregulated, things like lipid metabolism were downregulated,\n And it all kind of makes sense, but now that you know that there's a difference at the level of gene expression, how do you actually treat dandruff? So this is the lawn of malassezia. This is the malassezia with a spot of the head and shoulders.\n active put on it. The malassege just doesn't grow where that head and shoulders active actually is. These active ingredients can be zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, or peroctone olamine. They are controlling the metabolism of those malasseges.\n seize yourselves that are leading to irritating substances. So the idea is to suppress their bioactivity to some extent so that we're reducing the level of irritating substances on our scalp that trigger the irritation and hyperproliferation and bear disruption.\n that we talked about. Now that we understand like these clusters and these gene signatures of dandruff is can we reverse these gene signatures if we treat with head and shoulders. So this is the group of dandruff at baseline and these genes are all down regulated and then these genes are up regulated.\n You can see if you treat with just a cosmetic shampoo that you really don't make a difference in those jeans. But if you treat with head and shoulders after three weeks, this signature looks just like somebody who doesn't have dandruff. And so you're looking at\n So head and shoulders reduces the malassezia irritants on the scalp, changing your scalp's response, and ultimately reducing skin\n flakes, so unlike dinosaurs, we don't have to live with dandruff. But in their case, the presence of skin flakes reveals something important about their biology. They had evolved warm-bloodedness, and hence feathers as a way\n to keep warm. But once they had feathers, skin could no longer be shed in one piece like a snake, but instead in tiny pieces. So in fact, although it's an amusing discovery, it actually had quite an important or profound point.\n Because it tells us that dinosaurs, while commonly called reptiles, are on the side of the birds and the mammals in terms of physiology. They were definitely warm-blooded. Hey, I hope you learned something from watching this episode of\n video I certainly learned a lot making it and if you want to find out more about head and shoulders research or about how to get rid of dandruff I will put a link to their website down in the description so I want to say a big thanks to head and shoulders for supporting this episode of Veritasium and I want to thank you for watching or\n watching."

            "transcription": "When I was in the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway, I came across one of the strangest sights I have ever seen. Cod. Hundreds of thousands of them strung up on racks.\n their stench blanketing entire villages. This annual massacre has been going on for over a thousand years. And it may be the very reason the Vikings existed.\n The poles of our planet are hostile to life, especially human life in the time before modern comforts. Not only are the winters long and\n and cold, they are also dark. And that is important. As humans migrated north across Europe, a strange illness emerged. It especially affected children. Their bones grew\n The condition became known as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. From studies of bones,\n we know it was prevalent as early as the Roman Empire, but likely much earlier. And doctors were powerless to cure the disease because no one knew what caused it. Scientific evidence only came to light in\n the early 1920s during an experiment in Vienna. It was discovered that children with rickets recovered miraculously after they were regularly allowed to play outside on a balcony. Scientists realized without fully understanding\n why that sunlight is essential for the development of healthy human bones. Today we understand what's happening is ultraviolet light from the Sun strikes cholesterol molecules\n just under the surface of our skin and it activates them to become vitamin D. This vitamin D is essential for absorbing the calcium necessary to form strong healthy bones but north of 42 degrees latitude\n there isn't enough sun in the winter months to form any vitamin D. Hence the epidemic of rickets. The notable exception here is the Vikings. They occupied what is now Denmark, Norway, and\n Sweden well north of the 42nd parallel and yet they had a reputation for being an imposing fighting force. Over 1200 years ago they raided towns all along the coasts of Europe. They laid siege to Paris\n The Vikings were intrepid sailors, voyaging out across the seas, establishing colonies in Iceland and Greenland. They even reached North America, the first Europeans to do so, 500 years before Christopher\n Columbus. So why weren't they overcome by the debilitating illness of rickets? Well because although Scandinavia is cursed with a lack of sunlight, the cure is swimming just offshore. That's right, caught.\n That is one\n big fish. This fish was an essential food source but even more than that it was a source of vitamin D in the oily flesh and particularly in the fish's liver. That is\n Just one meal of cod with liver and eggs supplies enough vitamin D to last you a month and your body can store it because vitamin D is fat soluble. To survive the\n dark winter months and to build strong healthy bones in children, cod was essential. So were the Vikings just lucky? I mean they lived in a part of the world that is virtually uninhabitable\n due to its lack of sunlight, if not for the cod. Without cod, there likely never would have been a large thriving population of warriors in northern Europe. So is cod the only reason we still know\n about the Vikings? Did Cod, in a sense, create the Vikings? Well, I think it's more complicated than that. The Vikings figured out how to use the Cod to promote better health. One practice they passed down from generation\n to generation was extracting oil from the cod's livers, the part of the cod that is richest in vitamin D.\n So was this science? I mean, I think it's tempting to think the Vikings figured out something that remained a mystery to modern medicine for over a millennium. But I think it probably went something like this.\n Maybe some people noticed that cod liver oil drinkers were healthier or their children taller, sturdier than those living further inland. And so the cultural practice of drinking cod liver oil spread, like evolution, but for ideas.\n Humans living together observing one another and emulating what works is a kind of proto science. It's like running numerous uncontrolled experiments, but carried out over a whole population for generations.\n comes out of that is likely to have a basis in truth. And the culture served as the memory of the population of people. This is essential because life is complicated. There are so many\n Different things in nature and so many interactions that have to encounter each one anew would be chaotic and overwhelming. We are able to function in the world because of the knowledge handed down to us, both explicitly\n but also implicitly by way of our culture. Tradition can be a way of encoding knowledge, a way for us to build on those who came before, especially in a time before systematic teaching or books.\n The Vikings clearly understood that cod and cod liver oil were beneficial, but not exactly how beneficial or why. In the Greenland Viking settlement, that cultural knowledge was apparently forgotten.\n There, the Viking settlers turned to farming as their main source of subsistence. And without as much cod in their diets, the lack of vitamin D was crippling. Literally. Exhumed bones reveal that among genetic deformities\n there are the telltale signs of rickets, spine curvature, deformation of arms and legs, a narrowed pelvis, and overall bone deformation and fractures. The Greenland colony vanished about 500 years ago.\n and vitamin D deficiency was one of the likely causes. If the Vikings had a scientific understanding of how important cod and cod liver oil was to their survival,\n they never would have stopped taking it. In the absence of science, traditional knowledge is often the best place to start. In fact, cod liver oil was actually the substance in which the first vitamin was scientifically identified, vitamin A, and later the fourth, vitamin\n But cultural knowledge is also not science. There are harmful practices like bloodletting mixed in with the helpful ones. And without knowledge of clear cause and effect, the importance of some practices like taking the cod liver\n oil can be forgotten. It was the British who realized through the first known randomized control trial that citrus fruits cure scurvy and as a result it was their fleet rather than say the Vikings that came to dominate.\n I would argue that the scientific method is the greatest technology humans have ever developed. It allows us to understand not only what works, but why it works.\n And with that knowledge our future is determined not by luck but by our ability to manipulate reality to our advantage.\n This video was made with excerpts from my feature-length documentary, Vitamania, so if you want to watch it for a couple bucks, click this link to find out how.

Well, yes, but if I had the other sticky tape, it wouldn't do that.\n And that's important because if you're a small robot trying to climb a wall, you can't afford to have something like chewing gum on your feet because then every step you take is effort. What you want is something that only grabs when you need it to.\n And that's kind of the main principle of our gecko-inspired adhesive. Here, this is an early prototype of the StickyBot gecko-inspired robot. This got us into a long effort to understand what is it that makes gecko adhesion work, having something which\n GECOs are incredible climbers. They scale walls and even walk on ceilings. But for a long time, we didn't know how they did it. They don't use hairs or spikes.\n spikes, like spiders or other insects. You might think they'd have tiny little suction cups at the end of their feet, but their adhesion is actually way stronger than suction cups. A gecko can easily hang its entire weight from just part of one toe.\n The clue to how this works can be seen if you zoom in on a gecko's toe.\n And that's important because the physical principle they use to stick is actually incredibly weak. It's not like an ionic bond where atoms are attracted to each other because one is positive and the other is negative. It's not even\n even a hydrogen bond, like in water, where part of the molecule is slightly positive and the other part is slightly negative. No, geckos rely on the attraction between neutral atoms. So how does that work?\n Gecko is climbing up a glass window. The gecko atoms are neutral and the glass atoms are neutral. But at any particular instant, the electrons around an atom are not perfectly evenly distributed about the nucleus. They may be a little bit more on one side,\n one side than the other. Now, if there's a neighboring atom really close to it, say an atom for the glasses within a few nanometers, this\n This charge can induce a complementary charge imbalance on the glass atom. So now the electrons from the glass atom are attracted to the nucleus of the gecko atom and vice versa. There is a very weak force of attraction between gecko and glass.\n This is known as a van der Waals force. Van der Waals forces are, at least in part, why gauge blocks, smooth flat pieces of steel, can stick together.\n But generally, we don't notice van der Waals forces. We don't feel them with our fingers, because at least on the molecular scale, our skin is incredibly bumpy.\n Touching a piece of glass is like putting a mountain range on top of a flat plain. There aren't many points of close contact. Geckos overcome this using all those tiny branches. So this means that when the gecko puts its\n Replicating the gecko's intricate branching structures is currently\n impossible. Under a microscope, you can see that the artificial gecko adhesive\n is covered in rows of sharp wedges. The tips are around 1 or 2 micrometers wide. That's a hundred times narrower than a human hair. To create such fine structures requires a labor-intensive process.\n process. A block of wax is used as the base for a mold, and then a razor blade is repeatedly pressed into the block creating wedge-shaped indents. A silicone polymer is poured into the mold, and a backing material is attached\n attached. After about 24 hours, the adhesive is cured and ready to go. But the mold can only be used a few\n times before the quality of the adhesive declines and you have to start all over again.\n So therefore it's not sticky because there's no no van de Waals force worth mentioning. As you load it in shear these things all bend over and we get a much larger in fact almost continuous contact area and so like the gecko we\n have some van der Waals forces to work with and that's what gave us adhesion. So to make the adhesive stick you have to pull it parallel to the surface that's known as a shear force and you have to pull it in the direction that will bend the wedges so that they may\n contact with the surface. If you pull it in any other direction, it won't stick. This makes it easy to pull the adhesive straight off the surface. There is basically no contact force.\n They used this property to create an incredibly small and lightweight robot called Microtug. It weighs just 17 grams but is able to pull a 20\n kilogram weight. That's the equivalent of a human towing a blue whale. Just six of these tiny robots can tow a car. The gecko adhesive is on the underside of the microtugs, so when they're pulling the car, the material\n is in shear and it sticks tight to the ground, but as the car moves forward the shear force decreases and so it's easy for the robot to pick itself up and move itself forward. The amount of pulling force attainable depends on the\n area of adhesive that's in contact with the surface. So they've developed a method for measuring this by shining light through acrylic. So what it does is shines the LED across the acrylic and whenever there's a contact with the surface if it frustrates the\n One square inch of contact area can support the weight of about 4.5 kg or 10 pounds. Since the adhesive is directional to grip an object, two pieces of adhesive are\n attached in opposite directions. So when you pull up, both sides are in shear and so they both stick. Two opposing pads of adhesive were actually tested on a robot on the International Space Station.\n Think of it as like a drone, a UAV only actually uses a fan to push itself around inside the International Space Station. And the idea is that it could be there to take video or fetch something for astronauts. Our proposal was how about it should be able to float\n it along gently and stick itself to a wall, for example, or pick up a big box. Our goal is to get that blue LED to turn green. Because there's no gravity, you don't actually need a lot of force, but you do want to be able to grab very\n gently and release easily and so we got the gecko adhesives up at the International Space Station and it works just as well up there as it does down here. This went to space, this was in the space station. This was in the space station for about a year and a half. Wow.\n This principle can be extended to three pieces of adhesive so that when you pull them all in they can stick to a flat surface. When it's at rest these things are sticking up just a little bit and then when you pull there then they become\n flatter right? The entire pad doesn't touch because this both surface is not perfectly flat and then once you activate it oh yeah I could totally see that. I'm gonna unplug the power so there's absolutely no power\n to it at all and still attach to the surface. Yeah I was thinking that you'd have to keep the motor on but it just sort of like locks in position or what? As long as there's tiny bit of tension it just stays there forever. There are lots of potential applications for this\n material, but the most obvious one is for robotic grippers. Since the adhesive sticks well with just a small shear force, it's great for picking up delicate items like produce. These are meant to be sort of like smart gecko palms basically.\n trying to grasp with minimal squeezing. We're not even really engaging the ratchet mechanism there so it's like less than a newton. It can also grab bulky items or palm a basketball. Now can the gecko adhesive\n pull a car. They have hooked this one up to this rope which is connected to a winch here, but the winch is not actually secured. It is tethered back to four pieces of gecko adhesive which are just sitting\n on this pipe. So the question is can these four pieces of gecko adhesive anchor the winch as it pulls that car back?\n Yeah, it's moving. Wow, can I pull these off? How much is this?\n But of course the application everyone wants is to be able to climb a building. And this was actually a PhD project for grad student Elliot Hawks.\n It was a challenge because he had to get enough gecko adhesive in contact with the glass at any one time to support his whole weight. Let me know if you want me to try to climb a building with gecko adhesive and maybe even go a little bit faster.\n Hey, this video was sponsored by Brilliant, the online learning tool that helps you understand game-changing technologies, not only in the physical sciences, but also in computer science.\n So these days, everyone's talking about neural networks, how AI can win any game or write sonnets with chat GPT.

            "transcription": "Is our food becoming less nutritious? Many people claim that the nutrient content in our food has been decreasing over the decades, but is this really true and\n should we be worried? A study published in 2004 looked at 43 different common garden crops and how their nutritional value had changed between 1950 and 1999. Now what they found was that on average the protein content\n of those plants decreased by about 6%. Vitamin C decreased 15% and vitamin B2 by a whopping 38%. They also noticed declines in minerals like iron and calcium. Now there is some debate around the numbers\n because how well could we really have measured those nutrients back in 1950? But there is still this concern that the food we're eating today might be less nutritious than, say, the same vegetables 50 years ago. Several other recent studies also\n So if we're witnessing a nutrient collapse, what's causing it? One factor that many people point to is depletion of the soils. Given plants' drought,\n their nutrients up from the soil, intense farming practices were thought to be the cause of nutrient depletion. If you look at micronutrients, things like minerals, there are decreasing levels in plants. But farmers have always put a lot of\n effort into maintaining their soils and using fertilizers to ensure that the plants have all the nutrients they need, which makes that argument less convincing. We're still getting big plants and they wouldn't grow that well if they didn't have the nutrients they need.\n in the soil. So why else might nutrients be declining? One possibility is that it's selective breeding. If you look at crops like corn today, they're barely\n recognizable when you compare them to their ancestors, the wild corn from which these were bred. Basically since the advent of agriculture, we have been breeding our food crops for higher yields, for resistance to pests and changes in the climate.\n And by and large, we've been successful. Crops are now bigger and grow faster than ever before. But are they more nutritious? Maybe we've accidentally been breeding the nutrition out of our foods\n in pursuit of other objectives.\n something else to be able to determine whether it's selective breeding causing this decrease or something else. What would be really helpful would be a plant that has never been selectively bred. Where would you find one like that? Well this is where we\n In North America, there is a wildflower called goldenrod. It's an important source of protein for bees, but not humans, and so it has remained\n wild or untouched by selective breeding. But how would you know what goldenrod was like 100 or 200 years ago? The Smithsonian Institute have been keeping hundreds of samples of goldenrod dating all the way back to 1850.\n Using these samples, and samples they collected in 2014, scientists were able to compare modern goldenrod with goldenrod from over 100 years ago. And the results were astounding. They found that there\n There was a 30% decrease in the amount of protein in the goldenrod pollen over that period. So if it's not selective breeding, what else has contributed to goldenrod becoming less nutritious over the last 150 years?\n years or so. One rather surprising idea was that carbon dioxide could play a vital role.\n and makes its way into every living cell. CO2 is like plant food in the air. It basically increases the growth of all plants. Over the last couple of centuries, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased a lot for\n from about 280 parts per million to over 400 parts per million today. Now that might not sound like a lot, but if you're thinking of it as plant food, we're talking about an increase by almost 50%. And we can see the impact from space.\n It's called the greening of the planet. Scientists have been tracking the impact of CO2 on plants via experiments called FACE, which stands for Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment. There are experiments run\n by injecting more CO2 into the area where plant crops are grown, and they find that wheat and barley, rice and potatoes, they will grow faster if there's more CO2 in the atmosphere. But here's the thing, they don't necessarily become\n In other studies conducted in Japan and China, scientists pumped carbon dioxide into rice crops to simulate the kind of CO2 concentrations expected in 50 years' time. On average, protein\n levels fell by 10%, iron by 8%, and zinc by 5%. But a lower concentration of nutrients doesn't necessarily correlate with a decline in the plant's nutrient contents. It's called the dilution\n effect. So what does all this mean for us? Well by 2050, scientists estimate that up to 150 million people in the developing world may be on the verge of protein deficiency due to the decreasing levels of protein in their\n staple foods. So does that mean we should all be taking vitamins and supplements? Well no, at least not yet, because the nutrient declines are small enough that you should still be able to get everything you need from a well-balanced diet, including plenty of fruits and\n veggies. But the increasing levels of CO2 and the dilution effect may be exacerbating the obesity epidemic. The thinking goes like this. We feel full or satiated when we've consumed a certain amount of protein.\n So if the protein levels are going down, we may have to eat more food, more carbohydrates, and more fats to achieve the same level of protein. And that may make us fatter. While this is still a contentious theory, what is becoming increasingly clear is that the\n changing atmosphere, specifically the rising level of CO2, is changing the food we eat.\n this video as kind of a companion piece to my new feature length documentary called Vitamania all about the scents and nonsense of vitamins and supplements. You can watch that documentary if you haven't already by clicking right here. It's available globally except for France and Germany because it\n It'll be on your TV on September 25th.

At least certain types of it are. I mean, my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave. That's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation. That is, radiation with enough energy\n to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts. If you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that. But we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time.\n Bananas, for example, are rich in potassium, and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive. So when you eat a banana, you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation. That's one ten millionth of a sievert.\n Let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses. You know, since people eat bananas, we become radioactive too. So you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone. But I wouldn't worry about\n that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth. I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space. The level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour.\n And that's about average globally, the levels usually between 0.1 and 0.2 micro sieverts per hour. But there are places with significantly higher levels. So who on earth do you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation? Let's answer that question.\n question by going to the most radioactive places on earth. Some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you. I'm in Hiroshima and that is the peace dome. It was about 600 meters above\n that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city. It was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact. But the level of radiation today, almost 70 years later, is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour.\n I'm about to get into an elevator. We're going down the water shaft. This is an old uranium mine. This is the mine where uranium was discovered.\n It's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material. 1.7 microsieverts per hour. It's about ten times the natural background that you would have.\n Nowadays most of the uranium has been removed, but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it fluoresces. Look at that fluorescent uranium ore.\n This is the lab of Marie Curie. She won two Nobel Prizes, one in physics and one in chemistry. And she conducted a lot of her work here. And this is her office.\n She would have sat right there. Apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive. One is this doorknob. Well, it climbs not much, but... But it's like ten times the background. Yes.\n More of that same. And another is the back of her chair. You can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here. Apparently after she was working in the lab she would come open the door.\n leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair. Welcome to New Mexico. This is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off.\n right here, right in this spot. This whole area was vaporized. In fact, there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all\n of the desert sand into this green glass. And you can still find it here. They've actually named this mineral after the test. It's called trinitite. Yeah. This is the\n only place on earth that this has ever been made. The level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour. The trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive. I've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour\n off them.\n can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet, up to 1 microsievert per hour at 23,000 feet, over 2 microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet, and over 3 microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles.\n That is Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four. It melted down on April 26, 1991.\n So what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off, spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe\n And that is why we can still detect the contamination here today. Now right now it's reading around 5 microceiverts an hour. If I stayed here for one hour, my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray.\n So this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere\n That's why we can stand here. We're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now. I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone.\n See those black bags at the side of the road? The Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did. Collecting up meters and meters of topsoil.\n I\n The mask is probably overkill. It's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs. This is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been. Even though the release of\n radioactive material was less than Chernobyl, only about 10%. Because it's much fresher, only three years since the accident, much less of it has decayed. So I've been getting readings up around five to ten microceivers an hour.\n and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that. I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fire.\n at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the fireman's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there.\n That's it.\n But you can see there's a huge pile of that gear there. Right outside the door I'm getting 500 microsieverts an hour just outside the door. 1500 microsieverts an hour.\n I don't know if we stayed here for a couple hours, we received an annual dose of background radiation. That basement was the most radioactive place I visited, and it's one of the most radioactive places on Earth.\n If I'd stayed down there for one hour, I would have received 2,000 microceivers. That's a year's worth of natural background radiation. Every yellow pixel here represents a banana. Now that might seem like a lot, but consider that in a CT scan, the patient receives about\n 7,000 microsieverts. That's three years worth of natural background radiation. It's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 microsieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster.\n For comparison, US radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year. But that's less than another occupation. Astronaut. An astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000\n and a microceiver it's worth of radiation. But not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation. So can you guess who is? The answer is a smoker's lungs. A smoker's lungs on average receive a hundred\n 160,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation every year. That's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking. So not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins, they also receive very high levels of radiation.\n radiation. So it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation. That honor goes to your ordinary average smoker.\n Hey, as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television. It should be on in the middle of next year. But being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book, The Day\n of the Triffids. It's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over. I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays.

            "transcription": "For some people, this room might be the scariest place on earth. Behind these black curtains are deadly spiders. Hundreds of them. And what we're going to do is\n is poke them, make them angry, and then suction the venom that appears at the end of their really long fangs. Well this is about as close as I ever want to get to a funnel whopper. And we're doing it for a very good reason.\n This is a funnel web spider. They live around Sydney, which just happens to be one of Australia's biggest cities. And they build underground burrows, which are distinctive because of the funnel shape of the web at the entrance, hence the name.\n name Funnel Web. But because they feel safe in dark, cool places, they can end up having unexpected run-ins with people. What happens is during the breeding season the male Funnel Web will leave his burrow and he moves around only at night looking for the female.\n But sometimes he gets a bit adventurous and he might leave his burrow, go too far from it. And so in the morning, once the sun starts to come up, he's too far from his burrow to go back to it. So he kind of has a little freak out and has to find somewhere temporary to hide out.\n during the day and so what he'll do is he'll head into a nice dark safe spot like a pile of clothing or a pair of shoes on the ground. You'll often see Australians bang their shoes together before putting them on just in case. If you\n If you are unlucky enough to get bitten, it'll be painful because their fangs can be up to 1cm long. That's longer than many snake fangs. And the venom delivered is fast-acting and deadly. We only milk the males because\n they are six times more toxic. So the male's venom actually produces a higher quality anti-venom. So the fastest time that we've seen an adult die from a male funnel-web spider was about 76 minutes, so just over an hour. So it's a very fast-acting, rapid venom\n Ideally, you want to stay calm, still, and apply a pressure immobilization bandage, and then get to the hospital as soon as possible. The venom contains a mixture of proteins, notably the delta hexatoxin.\n As it travels through your bloodstream, you'll begin to sweat, twitch, salivate, and get goosebumps. This is because the venom acts on nerve cells, neurons. Under normal conditions, neurotransmitters trigger neurons to open ions.\n gates, and positively charged sodium ions flood in. The dramatic swing from negative to positive triggers the release of neurotransmitters to the next neuron, and then the ion gates close and the cell returns to its resting state. But, funnily enough,\n The subvenom stops the ion channels from closing, so the neuron unleashes a flood of neurotransmitters like adrenaline throughout the nervous system. So muscles, normally under precise control, receive rapid chaotic signals, causing them to\n to tense up or spasm, which is a big problem for the heart, which begins to pump faster, raising blood pressure and spreading the venom further around the body. And eventually your body runs out of neurotransmitters.\n out them, nerve cells can no longer tell muscles what to do, so you're effectively paralyzed, and it's only a matter of time before your heart or lungs give out. Humans are particularly unlucky.\n not that deadly to most mammals. If something like your dog or your cat or a rabbit gets bitten by a male final web spider even, even the male, they'll show very few symptoms. And then you could also be bitten by the exact same spider and be in a very severe way.\n And that's because the effects of venom are very species-specific. Delta hexatoxin binds to a specific site of the sodium ion channels in primates, which causes chaos. But that same spot isn't there in other mammals.\n The lethality of this venom in humans seems to be an accident. It only affects invertebrates, which are their prey, and also primates. So it's really toxic to monkeys and apes and of course we are extremely\n badly affected by that. The first people arrived on the continent around 70,000 years ago, but this spider evolved 40 million years ago, and it just happens to be extremely deadly to people.\n So it seems like an unfortunate coincidence that venom originally evolved for effectiveness against insects turns out to be deadly for us. The people here at the Australian Reptile Park try to prevent that by making life-saving anti-venom.\n But to produce it requires collecting venom from their stock of spiders.\n You heard right. Funnel web spiders can actually survive underwater for up to 30 hours. They do this by trapping tiny air bubbles in the hairs on their abdomen.\n So, if you see a funnel-web spider at the bottom of a swimming pool, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's dead.\n can start milking them straight away. We haven't had to do any of the work to raise them and then yeah we'll milk them for that that period of time. Here's how you do it. First you poke it. So that's kind of the funnel web spider\n defensive stance they'll raise in the air like that and expose their fangs. Sometimes they'll actually form drops of venom just on the tip of each fang. Which is when we come in with a tiny vacuum. You basically just use it as you would a pencil and just\n strike the tip of the fang with that. Okay, I see that. There you go. I got a little bit. Sucked a big drop out. Well this is about as close as I ever want to get to a funnel.\n I'd say we milk about 50 spiders a day. If you were saying each spider produced four to five drops, you're only talking about maybe 250 drops of venom. What we've got in the end of the pipette there now\n would be enough to kill perhaps a dozen or so adult humans. To get one vial of anti-venom, they have to milk 150 spiders by hand. That takes 12 hours.\n 12 hours out. It's a lot of milking a spider to save one person. But I mean, I think that's worth it. The venom is frozen and sent down to a lab in Melbourne, and there, rabbits are injected with it. Now, although it's not as toxic to rabbits as\n as it is to humans, they still start with a low dose. Then, over a period of 6 months, they gradually increase the dose as the rabbits build up their immunity. Once they can withstand 6 times the lethal dose, their blood is collected, and it gets\n spun on a centrifuge to separate out the antibodies. And it is these rabbit antibodies that form the life-saving antivenom. Rabbits and people are similar enough that rabbit antibodies can still neutralize funnel-web venom in\n our bodies. Every year around 40 people get bitten by funnel web spiders, commonly from not checking their shoes in the morning. Unfortunately due to this program no one has died since 1981, so for over 40 years\n now we haven't seen a single death from one of these spiders. Before we end today, I want to thank today's sponsor BetterHelp. BetterHelp's mission is to make therapy more accessible to\n more people. And I think that's a really important goal.

            "transcription": "This is me at the end of college. So anyways, today I'm packing up. My room is absolutely disgusting. There's dust all over the place. Unbelievable how much dust this place accumulates. Just unreal. 21 year old me was apparently\n fascinated by dust. But where does it all come from? Well, in this video, we are going to get to the bottom of this. Now this video was sponsored by Google. And when they approached me about sponsoring a video, I suggested I show you how I use Google to research\n a complex question. After all, research is just re-search. Anyway, I couldn't pick a simple question like how far away is the moon, how old is Derek Muller, or how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? Because\n the video would be over already. But in the space of all possible queries, questions like these with clear unambiguous answers are by far in the minority. In fact, of all the billions of search queries typed into Google\n every day, fully 15% are ones that Google has never even seen before. So Google never actually gives you answers. Instead, in just a fraction of a second, it uses algorithms to select the most relevant information from the hundreds of\n billions of web pages it has indexed. What you do with that information is up to you. So for this video I intentionally selected something surrounded by myths. Dust. Unbelievable. So a while back when I was\n filming a different video, a PhD scientist told me, you know, 70% of household dust is dead skin. And I'd heard that before, and chances are you have too. If you type is dust into Google, the top autocomplete result is dead skin.\n in, because that's one of the most common ways people complete that query. But a quick scan of this page suggests that the claim is not true. It's a misconception. From live science, sometimes a specific percentage of dust is said to be dead skin, usually\n about 70 or 80 percent. But unless you're a mulching bird or reptile, or you work in Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory, very little of your environment is composed of dead body parts. Or BBC Science Magazine, which asks, what is dust made of?\n Think it's human skin? Think again. The article says it's a misconception that it's mostly from outside, the rest is carpet fluff and clothes fibers. And sure enough, all over the web you'll find people debunking this idea. So is that it? Case closed.\n closed? Hardly. I mean, I'm not just going to do one search and call it a day. It's important to be aware of your own biases. When I started this search, the claim seemed false. The idea that 70 to 80% of dust is dead skin\n It's exactly the sort of thing that is gross enough to spread as an urban legend, but it just seems implausible. I mean, if most dust is dead skin, then why do abandoned buildings get dusty over time? The debunking claims fit my\n preconceptions, so it would be easy to stop here. But you gotta be careful not just to search to confirm what you already thought. A common mistake people make is putting the answer they are looking for right in the search query. Looking more closely, these websites\n sites lack scientific papers as references. And I'm curious, if the idea that 70-80% of dust is dead skin, if that's totally wrong, then how did the myth get started in the first place? Surely some dust must be dead skin, but how much?\n Well, a good strategy is to start broad. How do you define dust exactly? Well, dust is generally defined as particles that can become airborne for a significant period of time when perturbed by natural forces. But how long is a significant period of time?\n period of time, and what are natural forces exactly? So the definition of dust has fuzzy boundaries, kind of like dust itself. If you ask the question, how big is a dust particle, you get different answers. The\n The International Standardization Organization defines dust as any particle smaller than 75 micrometers in diameter. That's roughly the width of a human hair. The glossary of atmospheric chemistry terms includes anything up to 100 micrometers, but I've\n several papers that include particles as large as 2 millimeters. This large discrepancy is due to the fact the most important property of a dust particle is not its size but its settling velocity, which then determines how long it\n can stay airborne. A 100 micrometer metal ball would fall to the ground very quickly while a 2 millimeter long cotton fiber could float on indoor air currents indefinitely. So to get around the different sizes, shapes, and densities of dust particles\n the International Standardization Organization has a way of calculating an effective diameter. They define it as the diameter of a hypothetical sphere of density 1 gram per centimeter cubed having the same terminal settling velocity in calm and\n air as the particle in question, regardless of its geometric size, shape, and true density. By any of these metrics, a single human skin cell with an average diameter of around 30 micrometers would count as dust.\n So then, how many dead skin cells are we shedding? You'd think the average rate of skin shedding would be well established, but the internet is a tangled web of misquotations and missing citations when it comes to skin. In trying to answer this question,\n I found dozens of web articles saying we shed anywhere between 30,000 skin cells per day to 300,000 skin cells per minute and estimated weights of dead skin as high as nine pounds a year per person. Using Google\n scholar a great resource for searching published scientific research I was able to track down several peer-reviewed sources that agreed on the numbers. Every hour you create about 20 million new skin cells. As those new skin cells form they push older\n cells up through the layers of the epidermis and over a period of weeks they flatten out and harden forming the barrier that protects our bodies from the outside world. Ultimately these dead skin cells fall off usually one by one for healthy skin.\n So we are constantly molting, like a snake. We just don't notice it because our skin comes off one cell at a time. Fun fact, dead skin cells are shed more rapidly from your forearms than from your back, and more rapidly\n from your back than from your abdomen. And one of the ways scientists have measured these rates of skin shedding is actually by taping containers onto people's skin and collecting up the dead skin cells shed over at least\n 48 hour period. Yeah, I'm gonna regret this. Based on these measurements, we know that each square centimeter of your body is shedding around a thousand dead skin cells per hour. Now the average adult\n body has a surface area of nearly 2 square meters, meaning you are shedding nearly 20 million dead skin cells per hour. That adds up to half a billion dead skin cells per day. Now half a billion dead skin cells weigh between\n 1 and 2 grams that's just a little bit less than the weight of a penny. Over a year that means you shed half a kilogram or over a pound of dead skin. If you want to think about it another way\n way, in a single year, you give off around 180 billion dead skin cells. That's roughly the same number as there are stars in our Milky Way galaxy.\n family of 2.6 people could cover the entire horizontal surface of an average 2000 square foot home with a layer of skin cells one cell deep in around 200 days. That is assuming all their dead skin cells accumulate around the house, which\n Of course is not true. Some will come off in the shower and some will get captured in clothes and bedsheets and be rinsed out in the wash. Not to mention dead skin cells shed outside the home. Still, the amount of skin we shed is not small.\n But how much is it as a percentage of household dust? Well that turns out to be a trickier question because there are a lot of other sources of dust like pollen, fibers from rugs, clothes and furniture, dirt from outside, even micrometeorites,\n dust from space. To clear things up, I called around to some dust experts, and they pointed me to this book, House Dust Biology by Johanna van Brunswick from 1981. And sure enough,\n On page 37, there is this graph. It appears to show the fraction of skin particles in airborne dust as 80%. Except, not really. This is a stacked area graph.\n This skin accounts for only 20% of dust particles between 100 and 300 micrometers. Could a simple misunderstanding of this graph be the source of the urban legend? I mean, it's possible. But what's more interesting to me\n is that the legend is not that far off. According to this, a full 50% of dust particles under 100 micrometers is dead human skin. The book also reports on a study where they vacuumed a mattress and studied the resulting dust particles\n under the microscope. 53% of the dust was skin particles. So the debunkers are debunked. While not 70 to 80 percent, dead skin cells do make up a significant portion of household dust. Of course the exact\n percentage depends a lot on how much other dust is contributed by the environment. These studies were conducted in houses in the Netherlands, which typically have hardwood floors and therefore less dust than homes with carpeting. It also depends on how long\n large of a particle you consider dust. Dead skin cells account for roughly half of the small dust particles, but much less than half of what is sucked up by your vacuum cleaner. Oh, that is gross.\n I guess it makes sense that the place where we find the most dead skin cells is in and around our beds, where we spend a third of our lives shedding a third of our skin in our sleep. So then is it true that your\n mattress actually doubles in weight every 10 years? This claim was actually published in a major news outlet 20 years ago, with the increase in mass attributed to dust mites that feed on your dead skin. The claim, which lacked a scientific reference, is\n It is so disgusting it has spread throughout the internet. But it's not true. If two people slept on the same bed for a decade, and even if all their dead skin cells ended up in the mattress, it would only gain around 3kg, or 7 pounds.\n of mass, the dust mites that feed off that dead skin could not weigh more than that. So the total weight gain would have to be less than 10% the weight of an average mattress. And remember, dead skin cells are small and light enough to become airborne, just\n making the bed has been found to increase the number of skin flakes in a cubic meter of air from 21,000 to 107,000. Skin scale dust is inevitable, and it occurs in higher quantities where there are more people.\n Scientists have studied the airborne dust in the London Underground and found that fragments of dead skin cells make up around 10% of all small dust particles by weight. And it's not just skin we are shedding. A ton of tiny organisms live on our bodies.\n a teeming microbiome of bacteria, fungi, and mites. Every hour we shed approximately 1 million microbes in a cloud that spreads out a radius of about 1 meter from our bodies. In one study, an individual\n The technique was so accurate, the team wrote that it\n clearly suggests a forensic application for indoor bioaerosols, meaning that one day we will likely use microbial dust clouds to solve crimes. Dust can reveal a lot about us because a significant fraction of it literally\n is us. I mean everyone has heard the expression dust to dust, but they're probably not thinking about how each and every day part of us is becoming dust. You know, when I was reading this house dust biology book, I found\n Some sections that sounded to me a little bit like poetry. So studying dust from an office under a light microscope revealed tree fibers from paper, eraser dust, rubber, calcite, and pumice, human hair,\n various dyed wools, cottons and synthetic fibers such as nylon, rayon, cellulose, triacetate and orelon, dander, tobacco, cigarette ashes, graphite, wood shavings, oil soot, paint chips,\n I love all these words because they bring vivid images to mind. It's like the tiniest fragments of our lives can paint a full picture of reality.\n of who was there and what they did. Searching through dust is a little like searching the internet. There are so many pieces, it's fuzzy, nebulous, but with the right tools and a bit of perseverance, I'm confident.\n that we can uncover the truth buried in there. In this case, the truth is that dust, particularly these small particles and dust around beds, is mostly dead skin. Why does that matter?\n Because it is something we can be certain about. I mean, for centuries, science has beaten back the shrouds of ignorance. And knowing what is really true is the only way we have been able to make progress. The internet gives us a great opportunity to learn about the world.\n opportunity to share that knowledge, but only if someone takes the time to research and establish what really is true.\n To perform a lot of this research I have of course been using Google, which might make you wonder how they figure out what to show you in the first place. Well good news, Google is not a black box. They have an entire website that takes you under the hood\n of the search engine and explains all the testing and improvements they make. Check it out by clicking the link in the description. And when you go to make your next search, try it a few different ways. Start broad, don't include your answer in the query, use image search and most\n importantly remember Google shows you the most relevant information. It's up to you to decide what to do with it.

            "transcription": "These are bacteria growing into increasingly concentrated antibiotics. The bacteria stop growing when they hit the first antibiotic strip, but then a mutant appears capable of surviving in the antibiotic. Then another mutation occurs,\n and now the bacteria can survive 10 times the concentration, then a hundred times, and finally after just 11 days of evolution, these bacteria can survive antibiotics a thousand times stronger than what would have killed them at the start.\n start. You're watching evolution in action.\n So I'm going to do a little experiment where I add some fluorescent powder to this dishcloth to represent bacteria without telling anyone in my household. And then I'm going to come back later to see where all of this powder ends up. But for now, I'm off to mission.\n to see the world's longest running evolution experiment. Let's go. This is Richard Lensky. He started the experiment 33 years ago.\n and along with a team of colleagues, he has kept it going, even on weekends, ever since. In this lab are 12 flasks of live E. coli bacteria. They are the lucky few, the ones\n that have survived over three decades of evolution in a lab. So there are 12 long-term lines. In 1988, a single common ancestor spawned these 12 separate populations, and ever since that day,\n they have been growing and dividing independently. So how have they evolved? There are other long-running evolution experiments, like since 1896, scientists at the University of Illinois have selectively bred corn, but they get only one\n generation per year, whereas these bacteria go through six or seven generations a day. So after 33 years, the bacteria in these flasks are generation 74,500. If those were human generations,\n it would represent 1.5 million years of hominid evolution. What we do to start the experiment is we dilute a large population of bacteria onto a petri dish and each individual cell makes a\n And so then we take a little bit from one colony to start one population, a little bit from another colony to start another population, but effectively they all started from individual cells and that's important because it means if we see the same thing happen\n in replicate populations, it's not because they started out with the same genetic variants and natural selection just fished out the same thing over and over. You actually had to have independent mutations that would give rise to the\n The lab environment is very different from the one the bacteria are used to. It's much simpler, there are no other organisms\n They're kept at 37 degrees celsius, and they live in the same solution, a mixture including glucose, potassium phosphate, citrate, and a few other things. Their only carbon source is glucose, which is limited.\n Consuming that glucose and converting it to offspring, replicating as fast as possible, has been essentially what we seem to be selecting for. Every day in each flask, the bacteria divide six or seven times, which increases their numbers\n a hundredfold. Normally we think of generations as being limited by the time that has elapsed, but in the case of these bacteria, they're limited by the resources available to them. If they had ten times the solution, they would increase their numbers an additional\n Then, almost every day for the past 33 years, this transfer process has taken place. 0.1 milliliters, or 1% of the solution from each flask, is transferred to a sterile new flask.\n This gives them the space and resources they need to grow and divide again, increasing their population a hundred times, before this same process is completed.\n process is repeated the next day. And then the day after that, and the day after that, even on weekends, this process has been going on for over three decades. What happens to bacteria that are not transferred to the new flasks?\n the 99%? That's the autoclave room. What happens in the autoclave room? Every day 99% of the E. coli meet their demise in this horrible room. Is this like a bacterial crematorium? Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n You can imagine if the scientists didn't do this, but instead gave all the bacteria a hundred times more solution to grow on every day, well the experiment would soon become unmanageable. On day two you would need a cubic meter of solution.\n But by day 13, the experiment would be 10 times the volume of Earth. And by day 42, the experiment would fill up the entire observable universe. To me, it seems like the whole idea of genetics is for them to stake\n constant and for mutations to be rare. Yes. Yet in your experiment it seems they're not rare. So we estimate that in our bacteria only about one out of maybe a hundred or one out of a thousand cells\n will have even a single mutation. So that's not very much. By contrast, in humans it's estimated that each one of our offspring has perhaps 10, 20, 50 new mutations. So the bacteria are extremely conservative, but they're also billions\n of them in even a tiny flask. And so if you have a chance in a thousand of mutating and you have a billion individuals, then every day in one of these flasks we might have a million new mutations. So that's a lot of variation on which natural selection\n and connect. Maybe half of those mutations have no effect whatsoever on the bacteria's ability to grow and thrive in that particular environment. They might be mutations that would matter out in the great outdoors, but this is a very simple environment. Maybe those\n genes aren't even expressed. Another half of the mutations, speaking very, very roughly, might actually be deleterious mutations. They make the bacteria an inferior competitor. But there's maybe out of those million mutations that occur every day, maybe there's 10\n maybe there's a hundred, maybe there's a thousand of them that actually change something in the cell that gives the bacteria a competitive advantage over their progenitors. And those then grow over the course of that day, then every day 99% of the population\n is eliminated. This lucky 1% prevails and if those lucky 1% include one of the guys from the previous day that was growing at 10% faster than the other guys, it has a higher probability of contributing to that next flask, the next\n days flask and in the fresh medium and it will continue to grow faster at a 10% clip and that compounds by an exponential process. So the mutations, you know, are really rare when they first occur and many of them are lost.\n But once they get common, if they have that competitive advantage, they'll just sweep through the population. But how do you know that the bacteria actually have a competitive advantage? I mean, how can you tell that they're getting better suited to their environment?\n This is where one of the unique properties of bacteria come in. They can be frozen for long periods of time and then revived.\n bacteria from the various generations. Every 500 generations, roughly 75 days, they freeze a sample of each population. By freezing previous generations, Lenski and his team have a frozen fossil record.\n So our samples from over 30 years ago remain perfectly viable. And so that gives us an ability to do what I like to call time travel. We can literally compare organisms that lived at different points in time. So we can compare\n That's right. The way they measure fitness is by competing the current generation of bacteria against older generations. It's like a strange bacteria fight club.\n They thaw out the old generation, mix it into a flask with the current generation, and then plate out a sample of the solution to see the relative abundances of the two populations at the start. Then they incubate the flask for a day,\n and then plate them out again. And the point is to compare their relative growth rates. Which generation was better able to utilize the glucose and divide faster?\n that you can say, hey, I'm the Evolve guy. And of course they don't. But what we have is this color marker embedded in the experiment. So six of our populations on a certain kind of agar plate make red colonies, and six of them make white colonies.\n and we have one version of the ancestor that makes red colonies and one that makes white colonies. We can compete one of the red evolved populations against the white ancestor or one of the white evolved populations against the red ancestor and we can distinguish them.\n In this case, it's clear that the evolved red population outcompeted their white ancestor. Now to determine the winner, all of the colonies are counted by hand. So what was the earliest sort of big findings from the\n experiment.\n and other evolution experiments, that evolution in a new environment gets off to a rip-roaring start and then tends to slow down over time. And so we repeated that observation and I imagined that the long-term lines would actually sort of flatline at some point. And I actually\n And it's a good thing he did, because in 2003, the bacteria started doing something remarkable.\n One of the twelve lineages suddenly began to consume a second carbon source, citrate, which had been present in our medium throughout the experiment. It's in the medium as what's called a chelating agent to bind metals,\n in the medium, but E. coli going back to its original definition as a species is incapable of that. But one day we found one of our flasks had more turbidity. I thought we probably had a contaminant in there, some bacterium had gotten in there that could eat the citrate and therefore\n had had raised the turbidity. We went back into the freezer and restarted evolution. We also started checking those bacteria to see whether they really were E. coli. Yep, they were E. coli. Were they really E. coli that had come from the ancestral strain? Yep. So we started\n doing genetics on it, it was very clear that one of our bacteria lineages had essentially, I like to say, sort of woken up one day, eaten the glucose, and unlike any of the other lineages discovered that there was this nice lemony dessert, and they'd begun consuming that and\n a second source of carbon and energy. Zach was interested in the question of why did it take so long to evolve this and why has only one population evolved that ability? He went into the freezer and he picked bacterial individuals or clones\n from that lineage that eventually evolved that ability and then he tried to evolve that ability again starting from different points so in a sense it's almost like well it's like rewinding the tape and starting let's go back to the minute five of the movie let's\n go back to minute 10 of the movie, minute 20 of the movie, and see if the result changes depending on when we did it. Because this citrate phenotype, there were essentially two competing explanations for why it was so difficult to evolve. One was that it was just\n a really rare mutation. It wasn't like one of these just change one letter. It was something where maybe you had to flip a certain segment of DNA and you had to have exactly this break point and exactly that break point and that was the only way to do it. So it was a rare event but it could have\n happened at any point in time. The alternative hypothesis is that, well, what happened was a series of events that made something perfectly ordinary become possible that wasn't possible at the beginning.\n beginning because a mutation would only have this effect once other aspects of the organism had changed. To make a long story short, it turns out it's such a difficult trait to evolve because both of those hypotheses are true.\n The experiment uncovered other surprising findings, like instead of the bacteria getting more numerous over time, they actually decreased in number. But each individual bacterium got larger. 6 of the 12 populations evolved\n evolved hypermutability, mutation rates 100 times higher than their ancestors. But these populations subsequently acquired additional mutations that brought the mutation rate back down. It's advantageous to be able to evolve faster than others, but if the\n If the mutation rate is too high, then offspring have too many deleterious mutations. But maybe the most surprising finding of all is what didn't happen.\n a very simple mathematical model. You can create something called a rectangular hyperbola, I guess, which has an initial high slope and then reaches an asymptote. But they're equally simple models. There's a model that also has just two parameters.\n called a power law model that says things slow down but it doesn't have an upper bound. It says just keep going for time immemorial and things will just keep going faster but a slower and slower rate of further improvement. And it turned out that model\n actually fits our data better than that original model I had imagined and not only does it fit it better, okay you say statistics, science, you know, fitting curves, it actually predicts the future and that's what's really cool because the original model\n If you give it, say, just 5,000 generations worth of our fitness data and ask it to predict into the future, it says the asymptote is here. But then when we get more data, no, the bacteria are up here. They've passed that asymptote. Whereas this power law model\n which says things are slowing down but never reaching an asymptote. We give it just one-tenth of our data from the past and it projects very accurately out to 50,000 and even 60,000 generations when we last looked. It predicts sort of the future course of the evolutionary\n trajectory. And to me that's kind of profound and it's sort of changed the way I look at this experiment and even a little bit how I look at life on Earth. I mean life on Earth doesn't stop evolving, we know that, and we know that but we think that's\n Oh, that's because they're asteroid impacts. That's because of human impacts. That's because they're viruses that are attacking their hosts and the coevolution is causing evolution to never stop. The world is always changing, so of course evolution never stops.\n 100% true. But what our experiment suggests is that even in the absence of environmental change, there are so many opportunities of smaller and smaller magnitude to continue to make progress that\n that in fact progress probably would never stop even in a constant environment. To me it's one of the reasons to keep this experiment going. Does this model continue to predict the unfolding of the future fitness trajectory?\n Okay, now the conclusion of the experiment where I look for that fluorescent powder using this UV torch. So let's hit the lights. Whoa!\n there is a lot of fluorescent powder around here obviously there's a lot in the sink but also here on the tap looks like someone wiped down the handle and the faucet oh check out the dishwasher\n Yeah, and on the handle. This is a great way of visualizing how dishcloths can spread bacteria around the house. What? It looks like finger marks.\n Huh. As a dad, I encounter lots of big messes and sticky hands and slimy faces. So when there is a mess or spill in my kitchen, I choose to clean it up with Bounty. So I want to thank Bounty for sponsoring this video, and I want\n I want to thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "Part of this video was sponsored by LastPass. Stick around to the end for a word from our sponsor.\n said no this is for real there's science behind it and so I looked into it and I found this there are literally hundreds of published peer-reviewed scientific studies on the biological effects of ions it's a body of research that begins about a century\n go and continues to the present day. And this is just a fraction of it. Now these studies aren't just about any old ions, they're about atmospheric ions or air ions. And although the results are not uniform, they all begin with the\n premise that positive ions make us feel bad and negative ions make us feel good. So in this video I want to get to the bottom of this. These are Himalayan\n and salt lamps.\n your whole body and all living things and that's what makes you feel good. Awesome. Can I jump in here for a second? When I first heard all this business about atmospheric ions, my first thought was why should we expect there to be many ions in the atmosphere?\n atmosphere at all. I mean, to recap, an ion is just an atom or a molecule that has gained or lost an electron. If it loses an electron, it's a positive ion. If it gains an electron, it becomes a negative ion. But here's the thing. Unlike charge\n attract. So moving about in the atmosphere I'd expect the positive and negative ions to find each other and then boom they're back to being neutral. However as it turns out there are some processes that are constantly generating atmospheric\n For example, cosmic rays. These are highly energetic particles from across the universe that slam into our atmosphere and transfer their energy to the air, creating ions in the process. Cosmic rays are thought to create\n around 500 ions per cubic centimeter at ground level. In fact, they're the most significant source of ions generated over the oceans. But here on land, there are other sources of ionization. Things like natural\n radioactivity. There are these long-lived isotopes of uranium and thorium and their decay products that can spit out highly energetic particles in the form of alpha, beta, and gamma rays. These ionize the air\n They vary widely from place to place, but they can contribute hundreds up to many thousands of ions per cubic centimeter. If you were to recommend one of these to me that like has the most negative ions,\n or which one do you think? I would just go for which one's hottest. Yeah. Because it's the heat from the light bulb that creates the heat which makes the reaction in the salt. Got it. Wow, this one's great. Yeah? This would just be perfect.\n And then you have thunderstorms. Each lightning strike generates copious amounts of ions. Perhaps one of the more surprising\n sources of negative ions is waterfalls. As water droplets collide with each other or with wetted surfaces with high velocity, the water molecules create this electrified spray with negative ions that can be transferred to the air.\n around it. Depending on your distance from the waterfall, ion levels can reach tens of thousands of ions per cubic centimeter. And the same effect occurs with ocean waves crashing on shore.\n Hello. Hi, Derek. How are you? Good. Can I give you that? Sure. So what I want to know is how many negative\n ions are there coming off that lamp when it's on? We have a technique involving mass spectrometry that measures negative ions coming off of solids and so we can give it a try. Are you an ion expert?\n I've been studying ions for 55 years. Whoa. And I've written hundreds of papers on all aspects of ions. So this is my salt lamp. It's meant to give us lots of negative ions.\n Can you tell me whether it's giving us some negative ions? We're going to have a look and the thing we're utilizing here is that the inlet to this mass spectrometer is at atmospheric pressure and if there's ions there we'll be able to detect them. So this is like a\n Is it kind of like an electronic nose or something? For ions. You could think of it as a nose for ions. It sniffs the ions. The lamp is next to the ion sampling cone. I mean it's not on yet, but we'd see if there's any ions coming from it.\n So this display here, this is our mass to charge axis here, so how heavy they are in molecular weight essentially, and if there's ions being formed, we're going to see some signal on this screen. It'll be like some peaks. Some peaks, yeah.\n There we go. Now does it need to warm up or? I think that's the idea. Now there are some places that do naturally have lower concentrations of ions, namely the interiors of houses and businesses.\n because these structures provide some shielding from the cosmic rays and from the natural radioactivity. Plus, if you have metal ducting and air conditioning, well some of those charged ions will get stuck in the ducts. So typically levels in\n inside homes and businesses can be as low as around 100 or 200 ions per cubic centimeter. Ion concentrations are also typically lower in polluted areas, in big cities or around factories.\n And that's because the ions actually cling to those pollutants, or the aerosols, and so they don't live as long in the atmosphere. So the assertion that we live in environments with fewer ions than our ancestors is true.\n If you're thinking that you feel better around waterfalls and oceans and after thunderstorms than you do in polluted cities or around big factories, well, maybe that's the reason why scientists have been studying the effects of negative ions on human health.\n for nearly a century. So let's consider the evidence. In one study, people suffering from seasonal affective disorder were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Bright light therapy, high concentrations of negative ions\n or low concentrations of negative ions. They found that both bright light therapy and high density negative ions independently produced antidepressant effects, but not low density ions. In another study, participants in a high density negative ion\n ion environment had significantly faster reaction times and reported being more energetic than those in an ambient air control. Now if all this sounds too subjective, EEG experiments showed people exposed to high density negative ions had a slower\n lower alpha wave frequency with higher amplitude. Participants also reported increased relaxation, alertness, and improved working capacity. And opposite results have been found with positive ions. In one study, volunteers were exposed to high concentrations of\n positive ions for two hours. Symptoms of anxiety and excitement significantly increased. During the time of exposure, serum serotonin levels also increased significantly. This has even been taken into real-world work environments.\n An air ionizer was fitted to the air conditioning unit in an office building and periodically turned on and off over 12 weeks. When the ionizer was pumping out negative ions, workers reported 50% fewer headaches. They also reported increased alertness, perceived\n atmospheric freshness and environmental and personal warmth. It's feeling pretty hot. It's been on for an hour. It's much warmer. Yeah. So the question is can a salt lamp generate negative ions? Let's check for negative ions.\n Let's look again. Doesn't look like it. But, I mean, there's not even like a background. No.\n It's just like it's not even sitting there. So your conclusion after testing this device is that it's producing no negative ions. We're certainly not able to detect any negative ions.\n The idea for how these salt lamps are meant to create negative ions is that water molecules are meant to land on the surface and liberate chloride ions from the lattice. But ask any chemist worth their salt and they'll tell you the energy\n The energy required to do this is way too high, so it just doesn't happen. What I find ironic is that there are crystals which, when heated, will produce ions. It's just that salt doesn't have the right crystal structure to make this work.\n The gemstone tourmaline does.\n of the crystal. You have discharges between those faces, breakdown in air and forming ions, and that charge then can get transferred to any organic molecule that's present in the air. A five degree change was enough to generate ions. I just find this\n extraordinary that there is a crystal, there is a material that you could heat up and create negative ions. So the reason people wouldn't have tourmaline lamps is because tourmaline is just really expensive.\n Okay, so we didn't get any ions off of the salt lamp, but I brought something along that I think might give us some ions. This is an ionic air purifier. When this product was first launched,\n launched, it sold to 2 million units. It works by using high voltage to ionize the air and accelerate those ions to produce the light breeze you can feel, without any moving parts.\n got it pointed right at our ion inlet, so that's good. We seem to be seeing some ions at the moment and we have the ionic breeze right up next to the source. These are negative ions? These are negative ions. So if you want negative ions\n What you need in your house is not a salt lamp, it's an ionic air purifier. Before you rush out to buy one, I should warn you that generating these ions produces an unfortunate byproduct, ozone.\n Now we're measuring about 17 parts per billion actually of ozone. So let's put this up to the front and see whether or not we see an increase in the amount of ozone. It's up over 80.\n So now I think we're actually at the level of a smog alert. So you're saying that this device is creating air that would be considered smog in a city.\n I believe so. That is kind of ridiculous for something that's meant to purify the air. Can you smell the ozone? Yeah. Whoa. Does it trouble you?\n It doesn't bother me. I know it and I want to either leave the lab or turn it off. What am I smelling for here? It should kind of a sweet smell. Oh yeah. Does it smell a little sweet? Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people like that smell.\n But if you smell that it's not good. So perhaps we should shut this off before we asphyxiate ourselves. So, generating clean negative ions is challenging, but is it even worth the effort? The research is inconsistent. No signal.\n Of the studies that report significant results, many have methodological problems. In some, participants weren't blinded to the treatment they were receiving. When they were blinded,\n they may still have known when negative ions were present by the faint smell of ozone. Most of the studies have very small sample sizes. Plus, they surveyed participants on a number of measures, increasing the likelihood that at least one would show a significant\n difference just due to random chance. Ion levels were typically measured at the source and the distance to subjects was not tightly controlled nor were the other components of the air so there's no guarantee the participants were even receiving the expected levels of\n of ions. A meta-analysis from 2013 reviewing all the prior human ion studies concluded there was quote, no consistent influence of positive or negative air ionization on anxiety, mood, relaxation, sleep, and\n personal comfort measures. The only link they found was between negative air ionization and lower depression scores. Though the authors caution future research is needed to evaluate the biological plausibility of this association. Because fundamentally the\n idea that ions have any biological effect is implausible. Consider that in a cubic centimeter of air there are 10 to the 19 air molecules, so even with tens of thousands of ions the amount is insignificant, not even one\n part per billion, we're talking parts per million billion. And there's no reason to suspect the extra electrons would do anything anyway. I mean in your daily life you were constantly building up charge on your skin and discharging it through little zaps, say when you touch a\n What do a few more stray electrons extracellular do? Probably not much. So if ions do anything, it would likely be indirectly, say by removing pollutants and odors from the air.\n The ions would cling to the chemicals and then they would say get attracted to surfaces? Surfaces and stick to the surface, the chemicals stay on the surface. So I think ultimately if you are looking for a way to improve your mental and physical health\n that is backed by strong scientific evidence, then you should take a walk outside. I mean, you can walk near a waterfall or near the ocean if you like, but the thing that is proven to\n your mood is the exercise and as an added bonus you're guaranteed to get some fresh air.\n Hey, this episode was sponsored by LastPass.

            "transcription": "The 1918 Nobel Prize for Chemistry is probably the most important Nobel Prize ever awarded. It was given to German scientist Fritz Haber for solving one of the biggest problems humanity has ever faced.\n His invention is directly responsible for the lives of 4 billion people today. But when he received his prize, many of his peers refused to attend. Two other Nobel Prize winners rejected him.\n their awards in protest, and the New York Times wrote a scathing article about him. He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time.\n Perhaps, more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today. Part of this video is sponsored by Wren. More about them at the end of the show.\n If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States.\n and the US will have your back. The president is authorized to send in the Navy and the army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way.\n And even though the law that made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So why did people want poop-covered islands so badly?\n There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate. The waters near the island are full of fish, and these millions of birds eat them\n fish and then they poop. A lot. Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop\n 30 meters, or 100 feet, high. Technically, bird poop is called guano, and by the mid-1800s, buying and selling\n bird guano was big business. The price rose as high as $76 per pound, meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold. So why was there such a big market for bird\n Well, to answer that, we have to look inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is\n Nitrogen is part of the amino acids that form proteins. It's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen and red blood cells, and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for the development of the body.\n for all life on earth. We get our nitrogen by eating plants or animals which have eaten plants and plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is if you farm the same\n soil year after year, you harvest the nitrogen out of it. And eventually, there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize, which stunts their growth. They're\n leaves turn yellow and they are more susceptible to pests and disease. Crucially for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil, which\n is where bird guano comes in. Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to\n grow food in places that were previously unfarmable and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its\n former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872, guano was running out and Peru banned\n This was a crisis. William Crookes, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898.\n With the world's growing population and dwindling supplies of nitrogen, he said, we stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat. In less than 30 years time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation.\n But he also proposed a solution. It is the chemist who must come to the rescue. It is through the laboratory that starvation may ultimately be turned into plenty.\n Because here's the thing, nitrogen isn't rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen. But it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen\n triple bonded together. This bond is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example,\n would take two and a half electron volts. To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 EV. Two oxygens, 5.2 EV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 EV.\n 3.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount of energy. There are two processes that do this naturally.\n Nitrogen releases so much energy it breaks apart N2 into individual nitrogen atoms. They then quickly react to form nitrogen oxides. These molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with\n water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria living in soil that can break the N2 bond, using a tremendous amount of energy to do so. They make nitrogen\n available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly, and there's not enough lightning to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So chemists tried. In 1811, Georg Hildebrandt mixed\n When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the\n Increasingly sophisticated versions of these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed.\n When Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists. He was 36 years old, working as a low-level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father.\n with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry. Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea\n The idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen.\n New experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project, building equipment that could tolerate ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time, he was moonlighting as a technical\n Sultan for a light bulb manufacturer. So there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about a hundred kilograms of the refined\n metal in existence. But the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs, so they had most of the world's supply. Hopper suspected it might make the perfect catalyst, so he brought a\n sample back to his lab. And there, in the third week of March, 1909, Haber placed his sheet of osmium in the pressure chamber. And then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres.\n and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia.\n When the gas was cooled, one milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker. And the laided hobber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, come on down, there's ammonia!\n Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened a factory in Aupau, producing five tons of ammonia per day.\n People spoke of making bread from the air. With the fertilizer from this industrial process, on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food.\n As a result, the population of the Earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Haber's invention. The Earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer.\n In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process. The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a\n promotion, becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day, including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein.\n After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house. But if Haber was so well regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize?\n Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out, Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot.\n But he wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is\n also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020. A warehouse containing almost 3000 tons\n of ammonium nitrate caught fire. And in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated. The blast, which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away, killed at least 217 people and injured thousands\n thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale. This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The Aupau plant, where Haber's process was first\n into practice would also explode in 1921.\n The downside of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, a huge amount of energy is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate,\n form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product, and the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process\n to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead. His superiors believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of\n the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air. But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war.\n In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed. Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and had\n heavier than air, so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice, after the start of the war, Germany, France,\n France and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the Institute into a chemical weapons laboratory, and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas.\n employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him, innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way.\n At 6pm on the 22nd of April, with wind blowing toward the Allied trenches, German troops released 168 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas\n advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is two and a half times heavier than air, it sank into the trenches of the allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lungful of the gas suffered a terrible\n death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid. The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land.\n More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack. Haber was promoted to the rank of captain, and a week later he was back home in Berlin\n On the first of May, the Hobbers hosted a dinner party. And after the party wound down, Fritz took sleeping pills and went to bed. But that night, his wife Clara took his gun and went outside.\n into the garden, and there she fired a single shot into her chest. Her 12-year-old son Herman heard the shot and ran outside to find his mother as she\n She lay dying. The next morning, Fritz Haber was on a train to the Eastern Front to supervise a gas attack on the Russian army.\n Some have claimed Clara killed herself because of her husband's obsession with chemical weapons. And that may have been part of it, but honestly we don't know because no first-hand accounts survive that support this interpretation.\n What we do know is that Clara was deeply unhappy in her marriage. In 1910, after being married for eight years to Fritz, she wrote to a friend, what Fritz has won during these eight years,\n After Clara's suicide, Haber spent the rest of the war running his institute, researching chemical\n weapons, gas masks, and pesticides. By 1917, the Institute employed 1,500 people, including 150 scientists. It was like a mini Manhattan Project, but for chemical weapons. In total,\n 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I. When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off\n Germany's crippling war debt he tried to distill gold from seawater but the project was futile. In 1933 the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants including scientists\n were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish, but he never practiced the religion. Regardless, his military service exempted him from the law, but he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish science\n scientists who worked at the institute. The next year, in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland, he died of heart failure.\n Immediately after World War I, Haber's Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor, so they mixed in a phallus\n smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called Zyklon B. A decade after Haber's death, the Nazis requested chemists remove the foul smelling component.\n And this form of Zyklon-B, the chemical developed at Haber's Institute, was then used to perpetrate the Holocaust.\n Speaking about this story, it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain, or as a hero, for inventing the process used to feed half the world. But another approach is to regard him as\n irrelevant to the larger story. Because someone else would have figured out a way to process nitrogen out of the air. And other scientists were developing chemical weapons. Over the past few centuries, scientists\n science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably, but they have also given us ever-increasing ways to destroy ourselves. I think it would be great to believe that we could ask scientists to only\n work on problems that are good for humanity. But the reality is that every bit of information is a potential double-edged sword. You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used.\n nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive. So the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying our\n ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process. So, chemistry has made it possible for 8 billion of us to live on this planet.\n to have the standard of living that we do. But as a byproduct, we've changed the atmosphere, and now we're suffering the consequences in the form of more frequent and severe heat waves, among other things. Which brings me to an offer directly from me to you. I want to offset\n one month of your carbon emissions. And I'll do it with this video's sponsor, Wren. On their website you can calculate how much carbon you emit and which activities have the greatest impact. And if you like, you can offset your emissions through a monthly subscription. But they\n They don't just plant trees. One of the projects they're currently backing is a pilot study in Scotland called Enhanced Mineral Weathering. So the way it works is they spread small basalt rocks throughout forested areas, and then when it rains, those raindrops can\n contain dissolved CO2 in the form of carbonic acid and when the rain hits the basalt it reacts and the pH increases. Now that turns carbonic acid into carbonates like calcium carbonate and that precipitates out. So in\n solid mineral form, the carbon is trapped potentially for thousands of years. And this is the kind of chemical innovation we may need to solve the climate crisis. So if you want to join me in offsetting your carbon footprint, then click the link in the description. Ren is completely transparent\n about where they invest the money and they'll send you monthly email updates. If you're one of the first hundred people to sign up I will personally pay for your first month of co2 offsets which is not a standard offer it is just something I really wanted to do. So I want to thank\n Wren for sponsoring this part of the video and I want to thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world. Plus,\n The funnel-web spider, the blue-ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia are the most lethal of their kind. And even this cute platypus has an ankle spur which in the male secretes a venom that can kill\n a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Tarahumara.\n Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mom recalls, in the backyard there was a shed where we found redbacks. And I used to play in the shed? I don't think once we found the redbacks that we let you in.\n Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks, Mom. Now if you don't know what a redback is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up! I gotta tell Past Derek something. You see, it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous, because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it.\n venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking is it true? Do more venomous species really live in\n in hot places. Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic though it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this\n The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with 80 different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia.\n Well, this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov\n of periodic videos.\n of most chemical reactions. And I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rate.\n What you've got to understand about the venom\n It's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey, except they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom in the venom\n The funnel web evolved without any humans or other primates around, and yet ironically it\n its venom is most potent for exactly this group.\n Most species deliver not just one type of venom molecule, but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in\n from short chain to very long chain molecules. And these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins, which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins, which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues.\n But since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of Taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or in your stomach.\n Ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem Okay, so since drinking the venom is not going to kill you What should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do don't panic stay calm\n I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels so that's just quite close under the skin. And if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep\n your heart beating and your lungs breathing. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight\n to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a\n large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take 70 milkings of a\n funnel web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom. And what's worse, anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times, because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the\n anti-venom, making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder, well why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work, except for the fact that when you get bitten, you need to have\n a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about\n this and not people in cold climates. Well I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made?\n a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places. I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with in Australia, the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around southern Australia, every snake you find,\n Mount Kosciuszko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places. And the reason for\n for\n Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries.\n So why are there more venomous species in warm places?\n Well, the truth is there aren't. At least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short\n bursts of energy. So instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive, and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it\n only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete\n answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all.\n it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it doesn't invoke any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else, it's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong.\n And nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had.\n a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the\n northern latitudes of the northern hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet, and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened.\n It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there.\n structure of its scales. You see exactly what you'd expect. The spot gets narrower and narrower. The sides are getting cut off by the slits. Makes complete sense. And if you stop there, you would never realize that Eisenberg's uncertainty principle is\n As I started to go through this big investigation, I realized just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is pretty weak?\n Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently\n have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes. Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes\n Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva, so it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over\n other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species, put them in the comments below."

            "transcription": "You are not looking at a yellow ball. Your brain might think you're looking at a yellow ball, but look closer. The screen you're watching this on displays color using only red, green, and blue subpixels. The yellow your brain\n thinks it's seeing is actually a mix of red and green light. The camera I'm talking to right now has a sensor composed of red, green, and blue sensitive photo sites. Again, no yellow. Of course, I have the ball here in my hand so\n So I AM looking at a yellow ball. Or am I? After all, my eyes aren't so different from that camera. The human retina only has cone cells sensitive to red, green, or blue wavelengths of light.\n To perceive other colors, we have to integrate the inputs from those three cone types. When yellow light enters my eye, it stimulates my red and green sensitive cone cells, although not as much as pure red or green light would.\n With red and green sensitive cones equally excited, my brain tells me I'm looking at yellow. This is how our technology, our cameras and screens and projectors can trick our brains into seeing a whole rainbow of colors using just\n three wavelengths of light by triggering our three different types of cone cells in different proportions. So, is the ball really yellow? What does yellow even mean? A lot of people would say that color is the\n wavelengths of light that an object reflects. In other words, like Aristotle thought, color is a property of the object. But looking at the same ball on a screen, your eyes only sensed red and green light, yet your brain still perceived it as yellow.\n So it's also possible, like Galileo believed, that color isn't a property of an object at all, but a phenomenon of the mind instead. But whose mind? Because we aren't the only animals that can see the world in color.\n We oftentimes don't really think about how other animals see color. So for example, we buy our dogs bright red or orange toys that are only bright red or orange for us and not for them because they can't see orange or red as being distinct from\n So maybe we should start taking in the world from more than just the human perspective. Doing that might just teach us why color vision evolved in the first place. We're actually towards the lower end of the spectrum, honestly. We're a state of the art.\n Step up from our household pets, maybe, if they're cats or dogs. But not nearly as good as many animal groups out there. Butterflies, birds, fish, lizards, jumping spiders. Jumping spiders are harmless creatures.\n They don't ever really get big enough to pose much of a threat to humans. Of course, if you were a small insect, yes, you would absolutely need to be afraid of a jumping spider. They'll take down prey that sometimes like two or three times their own body size. The Chinese word for giant is giant.\n jumping spider translates literally to fly tiger and that's the way I like to think about them is the kind of small cats of the undergrowth. Jumping spiders are everywhere. They're in your backyard. They're probably in your kitchen. There are about 6,000\n Some are sort of furry, some are sort of shiny, striped, spotted, red, green, blue, pretty much anything you can imagine. It's like every one is a little work of art. As a group, spiders aren't known for their color.\n their vision. Most species are nocturnal, and for many, their webs act as a sort of extra sense organ. So they just don't need to see that well. But jumping spiders as active daytime hunters? Well, they're\n They're different. Not only do they have great eyesight, but different species have different forms of color vision. Look at those eyes. Jumping spider eyes are fascinating. And when I say eyes, I mean eight eyes.\n The pair of eyes that are perhaps the most fascinating or most unusual are what we call the principal eyes, and those are the\n It turns out, the way jumping spiders perceive\n color has everything to do with the anatomy of those principal eyes.\n two lenses in these eyes and in between those two lenses is a long fluid-filled tube. At the end of that fluid-filled tube is a second lens and what that lens does is it magnifies the image that that first lens produced.\n And when it comes to seeing detail, it's hard to beat a jumping spider.\n the better it functions. Jumping spiders absolutely break this rule. The secondary eyes can see the world about as well as the absolute best insect eyes out there, better than the world's biggest dragonfly.\n eyes whose entire head is consumed by an eye. The principal eyes, they can actually see pattern in the world better than a lap dog, a house cat, an elephant, and nearly\n as good as the sharp-sided pigeon. But it's a very narrow slice of the world that they can see. It's about like your thumb held at arm's length. And it's only in that narrow slice of the world that jumping\n Spiders can see fine detail and color. So the jumping spider's secondary eyes give them a full 360 degree view of the world. Now imagine most of that, some black and white, when you see\n something move, you can swivel to look at it, and now anything that's really of curiosity to you, you can add to this world of black and white vision, fine detail,\n color, but you can only do it moment by moment. So you're really kind of painting additional details about color and pattern that you couldn't see otherwise. It's a wild world to try to put yourself into.\n As they sweep their principal eyes across a scene, some species of jumping spiders are adding a lot more color information to their world than others. Most jumping spiders, including this one, are dichromaths.\n meaning they have two types of color-sensitive cone cells in their retinas, just like dogs and most other mammals.\n between UV, violet, blue, and green. But some types of jumping spiders are trichromats, with three types of cones, like humans, and others are tetrachromats, like birds. The weird thing\n is, all these species with expanded color vision aren't necessarily close relatives.\n That makes jumping spiders pretty special. I mean, consider primates. Old world monkeys, apes, and humans all have trichromatic color vision.\n We also share a common ancestor, so our color vision probably evolved only once and then it stuck around. This is where jumping spiders really stand out. The ability to see red, for example, has evolved several times.\n in jumping spiders. Researchers know that because they've figured out how different groups are related. And by they, I mostly mean jumping spider fanatic Wayne Madison. Oh my gosh, I like that.\n Fantastic! Beautiful male. Ah, it's been 30 years since I've seen a live Hawaika. He is absolutely Mr. Jumping Spider. His expertise really is in jumping spider taxonomy.\n I work on the evolutionary tree of jumping spiders. The evolutionary tree of life is basically the pathway of genetic descent that links all of us. The position of different species on this evolutionary tree can\n tell us how they ended up with the traits they have. Like, if most jumping spiders don't see red, but two species on two very different parts of the tree do, chances are that those two species evolved those abilities\n independently. In which case then we can start to ask questions like, what's driving that evolution? Do they have similar ecologies? Do they hunt similar prey? And try to really understand what selective force is.\n It might help them find food or discriminate tasty prey from prey that can harm them.\n to advertise that they're toxic. Another possibility is that seeing a richer world of color might help animals, from lizards to spiders, choose better mates. To test these ideas, the researchers\n Researchers needed to know which of the 6,000 species of jumping spiders had expanded color vision and which didn't. And outside of a few well-studied species, no one really knew. So the team set out to collect spiders from every major\n branch of the Jumping Spider family tree. It's kind of like Pokemon Go, except\n The Pokemon are real, they're smaller than your pinky fingernail, and they're really good at hiding.\n specialist jumping spiders that you're only going to find around termites. There was this one species that we only found in piles of bones in South Africa. Who knows what it was doing there, but we quickly\n learned that that was the only place in the environment we were going to find it. And so that's part of the fun of it. I feel like it's a bit of a treasure hunt really. With no proverbial stone left unturned, the team returns to their labs with hundreds of spider\n representing many different species. They want to figure out which species have expanded color vision, how each species does it, and why. It's actually a hard question to tell how animals can see color. We can't just connect our\n our brains to see what they see. So how do we do it? We begin by using a technique called micro spectrophotometry. It's a really long word. What it simply means is a microscope paired\n with a device that measures different wavelengths of light, a spectrophotometer. The researchers take ultra-thin slices of jumping spider retinas and then they measure the wavelengths of light absorbed by individual cone cells.\n With enough of these measurements, they can tell if a species is a dichromat, trichromat, or tetrachromat, and what wavelengths of light its cells are best at detecting. But that's not the whole story.\n That knowledge of what's in the retina tells us what is or isn't possible for these animals to see. But it doesn't actually tell us what they do see or how they might use that. And so the gold standard for establishing that an animal can see color\n In other words, we somehow need to ask the spiders what they can see and then understand their answers. Figuring out what's going on inside a spider's mind is difficult. It's no surprise that it takes a group\n of expert zoologists to do so. But our own minds can be just as complicated, yet we rarely talk with mental health experts to help us interpret our thoughts and emotions. Whether you're feeling depressed, anxious, or are just stressed and want someone to talk to, a therapist\n Let's you see things from a different perspective and that's where today's sponsor better help comes in I know finding a therapist you're comfortable around can be intimidating Especially if you're only limited to the options in your city, but better help lets you get around this because it's an online place\n platform.

So I want to thank BetterHelp for sponsoring this video and now back to jumping spiders\n and how they see color.\n from the background in color, but not in brightness. And you see if the spider tries to follow. The problem with letting the jumping spider actually turn and respond is that they'll absolutely do so, but it changes some of what they see.\n So what we want is to really have some control over what the spiders can see at any given moment. So the researchers hold them in place with tiny magnets attached to their heads. What we do is we give them a ball to\n If the spider turns the ball to the left, it's probably trying to look to the right to find\n follow the moving shape, and that's evidence the spider can discriminate between the colors of the shape and the background. Once the team knows which species can see which colors, the next\n The next question is, how do they do it? What's different in the DNA of these spiders that can see and discriminate more colors? If you ask Megan Porter, a lot of it comes down to genes that encode proteins called opsins.\n The way that animals achieve color vision is to have different copies of this opsin gene and those variations then are what produce proteins that are sensitive to different colors of light. The first technique\n that we generally go to with a new species is called transcriptome sequencing. And this is where we can take the entire head of a jumping spider and we can get the sequences for every single gene that is expressed in that tissue.\n This method gives the researchers an inventory of all the genes being expressed. In other words, all the genes that are copied out of the DNA and sent to make a protein. Then the team can figure out where each of these genes is expressed.\n In which eyes and in which parts of the eye? And we do that using a fancy technique called immunohistochemistry. The researchers basically create glowing molecular tags specific to each protein they're interested in.\n And then looking for which parts glow in the right color, we can figure out where each opsin is being expressed, where the protein is located. The team is especially interested in genes that are expressed in the retinas of the principal eyes.\n these are the genes most likely to be related to changes in color vision. Already, this process of asking which species have expanded color vision and how they accomplished it has led to some surprising discoveries. The researchers already\n They knew that the ability to see and discriminate more colors had evolved more than once among jumping spiders, but they hadn't realized just how widespread this ability would be. After measuring 45 species across the evolutionary tree,\n team has already found as many as 12 independent changes in color vision. In evolutionary terms, jumping spiders seem to be evolving new, expanded forms of color vision all the time, and different species have acquired their new\n capabilities in very different ways. Take for example the ability to see red. Most jumping spiders only have green sensitive and UV sensitive photo pigments in their retinas, but some species became sensitive to\n So in our eyes, that's exactly what happened.\n But other jumping spiders see red\n in a totally different way. Rather than evolving new photo pigments, they added an internal filter to some of their green-sensitive cone cells, which cuts out green light and forces those cells to respond only to longer wavelengths like red.\n They can basically create two kinds of cells from the same type of photoreceptor simply by using a filter in front of some of them and not in front of others. All this evolutionary innovation makes the original question even more interesting.\n even more intriguing. Why evolve expanded color vision in the first place? That's the question Lisa Taylor is trying to answer. For a visual predator like a jumping spider, better color vision could mean finding more prey,\n It could also mean avoiding prey that might be harmful.\n spiders learn to avoid and continue to avoid red prey that tastes bad. In this experiment, all the prey are termites. Some have a dab of red paint on their backs and others have a dab of gray. And this doesn't affect their behavior in any way.\n The red termites also get treated with a compound called bitrex, which is actually the most bitter substance known.\n taste disgusting so we can simultaneously and independently manipulate color and palatability. In other words, the researchers can make the termites red and bitter, gray and tasty, or if they want to mess with the spiders, gray and bitter.\n or red and tasty. The first part of the experiment is the training phase. Basically the spiders get to choose from a tiny buffet of termite prey, each one in its own little Petri dish. In three of the Petri dishes\n As they interact with this prey, they are constantly learning and it's constantly being reinforced that whenever they attack something red,\n They get a mouthful of bitter tasting termite and whenever they attack something gray they get a mouthful of tasty termite. The first spiders to go through this experiment are Habernotus pyrethricks and we started with them because we know that they have good color vision.\n that extends into the long wavelengths. Habernatus pyrithryx is one of the species that can see red using a red filter in front of some of its green sensitive cone cells. Our data so far suggests that the spiders are really good at learning the rules. And once they\n learn the rules, then the real experiment begins. The spiders hunt for all their food in a setup just like the termite buffet where they were trained, except that, for half of the spiders, there's a big difference. Some of the termites are still\n bitter, but they're all grey. The color cues are gone. Now the question becomes, do the spiders that have color cues available, in other words the ones for which bitter termites are still red, do they do better?\n So our data so far show that they do fare better when they have access to those color cues. They lay eggs sooner and that they're also heavier at the end of the experiment if they're in the treatment group where they have access to color cues. One hypothesis for why primates evolved expanding\n color vision is to distinguish ripe from unripe fruit, or tender new leaves from older, tougher ones. In other words, telling good food apart from bad food. Kind of like what these spiders are doing.\n We've got this kind of evidence in a jumping spider and we're going to repeatedly test that in other jumping spider species that have different forms of color vision. The team predicts that spiders with expanded color vision will use color cues to their advantage.\n So they'll do better when color can tell them which prey items taste bad. Species that can't see red won't get any benefit from the warning colors or from the training. If the data support these predictions, these will be some of the first experiments\n in any species to reveal an evolutionary advantage to seeing and discriminating more colors. But feeding behavior can't be the whole story, because the spiders had some more surprises in store. For example, there's a gene\n of jumping spiders in Central America called Mexicanus where males and only males sport incredibly bright red colors on parts of their body that they use during corcha. We thought for sure the female\n has got to be paying attention to red, distinguishing it from other colors. They've got to have red color vision in some special way. And it turns out that at least by our measurements, they don't have the ability to see red. They just have UV and\n green sensitive cells in those principal eye retinas.\n What's going on here? To help answer that question, and maybe understand why some spiders are displaying to one another with colors they can't see, it's time to revisit the jumping spider retina.\n stack of translucent retinas right on top of each other. One thing that we think that this layering does is to correct for a problem that the optics present to the retina. It's called chromatic aberration. Most optical materials\n Models like these glass prisms refract or bend short wavelength light like blue and UV more strongly than long wavelength light like red. That's chromatic aberration. Lenses do this too.\n In photos taken with vintage camera lenses, you can often see a fringe of color around high contrast edges. The sensor in a camera is a single flat layer of photo sites, so getting the different colors of light to focus in the same plane is critical.\n Modern camera lenses correct for chromatic aberration using complicated optical designs with lots of lens elements. But the other solution is to put different color-sensitive cells at the right depths behind the lens.\n That's exactly what jumping spider retinas do. And this gets us one step closer to understanding what red might mean to a spider that can't actually see.\n In the jumping spider eye, the cells sensitive to shorter wavelengths are generally closer to the lens, and those sensitive to longer wavelengths are farther away. But most jumping spiders are dichromats.\n they only have two cone cell types, so why have four layers in their retinas?\n researchers in Japan have shown that jumping spiders can actually use\n this discrepancy in focus to perceive depth and distance in their environment. But there is a liability with this system. It only works if you're just using one color of light, like green.\n If you start to mix in other colors of light, for example red, then the system creates errors. Essentially, colors like red might create this perception of being close or being looming towards the receiver.\n So a jumping spider's red coloration might not look red to another jumping spider, but instead create a sort of depth\n illusion. But why would a male spider benefit from displaying an optical illusion?\n If a female thinks a male is closer than he really is, that could throw off her attack.\n Or maybe confusing the female pays off in other ways.\n And amorous male spiders might not be the only ones exploiting these depth illusions.\n The possibility is that it's red simply to look like it's closer to a jumping spider so that it has a better chance of escaping. We also see small insects with red and blue patterns on them, which would create a really complicated\n visual illusion that might simply baffle it and require it a longer period of time before it judged this distance. Even a split second can really matter. But in this tiny game of cat and mouse, a spider that could see\n and discriminate red from green would be a lot harder to fool. And this could be another surprising benefit of color vision, one that isn't really about color at all.\n This information you can't just get from preserved\n on microscope slides. But there is another way. By using a particle accelerator called the Advanced Photon Source, the researchers have started to collect high-resolution x-ray videos through the\n If the spider's retinal movements change the shape or length of their eye tubes, that'll\n what they're capable of perceiving. It would change how they experience depth, it would change how they experience color. Previously this information has only been collected from dissections. So we're very excited to get super high resolution videos\n Unfortunately, a few months after their initial tests, the Advanced Photon Source shut down for upgrades that'll take over a year to complete.\n wait a little longer for some of the answers the team has been looking for.\n and they can actually be twisted to change the orientation of their field of view. The question is, how do these movements affect what the spiders can focus on? Or how they sense depth? Or even how they perceive color?\n It's this connection between focus, depth, and color that makes these spiders so intriguing. It opens up all sorts of questions about what color is in the first place.\n It's clear that these spiders have a lot to teach us about color vision, how and why it evolves, and how many forms it can take, even within a single group of animals. If our understanding of their visual system is correct, the experience of the species is a great opportunity to learn about the species.\n The experience of color for jumping spiders might even be three-dimensional in a way that's totally different from how we see the world. And we haven't even talked about their other senses, like their ability to communicate through vibrations.\n When you think about it, you realize that the universe we humans perceive, even with all our technology, is just a sliver of what's out there.\n to allow the world to be experienced in the fullness of itself. I think this is one of the tragedies of extinction, is the loss of oftentimes a totally unique way of experiencing our world.\n A way of experiencing our world that we probably couldn't even imagine. So, color. What is it? Is it an intrinsic property of an object like Aristotle thought? Or something\n that exists only in the mind perceiving it, like Galileo believed. Maybe it's not an either-or question. My belief is that color is something that emerges through the evolution of the eyes\n that see the world and the world that the eyes see. Color as a thing emerges through this dance, this evolutionary dance between what can be sensed about the world and those that are sensing it.\n It's that dance playing out over millions of generations that created the colorful world we inhabit and shaped the countless ways that we and our fellow life forms experience it.\n Come to me. Okay, not that far. They're not called jumping spiders for nothing. Come on.\n you"

            "transcription": "This video includes a discussion of serious crimes, which may be disturbing for some viewers, so I wanted to let you know that upfront. But I think it's necessary to talk about these crimes in some detail for reasons that will become apparent.\n In the small town of Visalia, California in the mid-1970s, one of the state's most prolific criminals got his start. He repeatedly broke into houses and stole small items like cash, coins, and jewelry.\n He was dubbed the Visalia Ransacker. But soon his crimes escalated. Six months later, in 1976, he moves up to Sacramento and over the course of the next three years is moving all across Northern California.\n Here, he was called the East Area Rapist.\n Variously known as the East Area Rapist and the original Night Stalker, these were brutal\n Police believed that all of these crimes were committed by the same person, now known as the Golden State Killer.\n How was it known that these were committed by the same person? Investigators were relying on MO. MO, modus operandi, is basically how a criminal will commit a crime.\n mask or hood. I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. The Golden State Killer had a very distinctive MO. What he would do is he would break into a house with a gun, a house with a man and a woman, he would tie them up\n up, tell the man I'm going to put plates on your back. If I hear those plates move, I'm going to kill your wife and then kill you. Take the wife into another room and sexually assault her. Then he would go through the house for however\n much time eating, stealing stuff, stealing little things or whatever, and then he would leave. How was he not caught based on fingerprint evidence? Well, he didn't leave his fingerprints. He always wore a mask. He always had gloves on. This was an offender that did\n everything to prevent himself from being caught. The Golden State Killer has been linked to at least 12 murders, 50 rapes, and a string of burglaries throughout California.\n How you doing? Good, good. So we supply DNA sequencing solutions to the forensic laboratories that process crime scene DNA. At a crime scene, there's typically less than a nanogram of DNA left, and it's usually degraded.\n Right, so it breaks down. Why is there so little? At a crime scene. A nanogram? Yes. That's insane. Yes. There's no accident that he stops in 1986. 1986 is when the first DNA case of a murder\n case is actually solved with DNA. And he's I think he's following that. And he's saying, you know what, what I'm doing here, I'm leaving my DNA. I can't do this anymore.\n state killer for decades.\n But having the unknown killer's DNA wasn't enough. They needed to match it to a known sample. In 1990, the FBI started work on what would become a\n National Genetic Database. It mainly stores DNA profiles from convicted criminals and persons of interest. It's called the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS for short. In each of your cells, there are 23 pairs\n of chromosomes, one from your mom and one from your dad. And at particular places on some chromosomes, there are short sections of DNA that repeat. Like AATG, AATG, AATG, and so on.\n These are called short tandem repeats, or STRs, and different people have different numbers of repeats. Forensic labs produce STR profiles by counting up the number of repeats at each location. Initially, there were\n only 13 places on the DNA where STRs were counted, but in 2017 that was expanded to 20. It feels to me like that's not that much information. It isn't. But the chances of two people having the exact same number of repeats\n at all locations is incredibly small. The CODIS database now contains over 18 million STR profiles.\n the FBI called CODIS since 2001 and has been searching ever since with no hits. We did Interpol searching trying to search other countries DNA databases and well maybe came from out of the country that's why after\n But genetic sequencing technology was advancing rapidly.\n Soon, private companies began offering genetic tests directly to consumers, and they provide far more\n genetic data than what's in the CODIS database. I traveled to Houston, Texas to visit Family Tree DNA headquarters. We'll go in the lab and we'll start talking about the life cycle of a sample. These samples\n What are they? So they're cheek cells. They just scrape the inside of their cheek, they put a cap on and they send it back to us. It's like a robot ballet. Yes. So for DNA extraction, we need to remove all of the protections that are on the DNA.\n and just separate it by itself so we can do testing on that. Instead of looking at 20 places on your DNA, these tests examine 700 to 800 thousand. The Family Finder test is based\n on what's called a microarray. And this is what a microarray looks like. Each one of those boxes is an individual. We can fit 24 individuals on here. And within that box is about 710\n ten thousand positions of your DNA that we're measuring, we're getting data for. Seven hundred and ten thousand. Yes, and they're called SNPs. So hang on, that's like seven hundred and ten thousand individual bases.\n The human genome consists of 3 billion bases. All people share about 99.9% the exact\n same DNA, which means on average, only about 3 million bases differ from person to person. These individual letter changes are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs.\n of like little pieces of DNA then? Yes, so what we have is a short piece of DNA that is specific to one snip. So it's one position in the genome where we know there can be a difference. Okay.\n Is there any example of a simple snip that, you know, confers some sort of... Actually, blue eyes is a single base change. Really? Yeah. So everyone with blue eyes has this one letter change.\n You can see now it's starting to scan the first box. The results of your 710,000 SNPs can tell you about your geographic ancestry or possible medical conditions.\n they can also quantify how related you are to someone else. The genetics of having a kid are a bit like cutting two decks of cards together. The resulting deck will share about half its cards with each parent, and there will be\n long sequences of cards which match identically sequences in each parent. Now if this deck has a kid, well then its offspring will share only about a quarter of its\n cards with each grandparent, and the sections of identical cards will be shorter. And this is how it works with DNA. The more closely you're related to someone, the more DNA you share, and the longer the blocks of identical DNA are\n But to compare the DNA of two people, you don't need to read every letter. The SNPs are sprinkled throughout the DNA roughly every 2000 bases. So if you find long sections where the SNPs match up, you can bet that the DNA is\n in between is identical too. By comparing hundreds of thousands of SNPs sprinkled throughout the DNA, you can see where these identical blocks start and stop, and so how much total DNA is shared.\n everywhere that is highlighted in blue is where I share DNA. With your father? With my father, which is exactly what you expect because I should share DNA with him everywhere because he gave me 50%\n of my DNA. So this is a second to third cousin. I have no idea who this person is. And you can see here we are definitely not as closely related as me and my dad because where the blue is, those are the only regions of the chromium\n where we share DNA. We all know that these genetic tests can help identify our relatives, but the question is can you do the same thing with law enforcement databases? Can you identify family members using the CODIS\n database. You can and it's only limited to really first-order and second-order relatives. That means if I'm looking for the Golden State killer I'm looking for either his father, his brother or his son. We did that over\n and over and over again with no hits.\n related you really are.\n The law enforcement is not allowed to search the databases of 23andMe and Ancestry.com\n But luckily for investigators, there was another way. An independent website called GEDmatch had been set up to allow people to connect with relatives. You can upload the raw data from any of the big genetic testing companies and search for more.\n matches.\n But that's a starting data point and theoretically by taking multiple of these individuals that share DNA and building their family trees using traditional genealogy and public source documents like census records and obituaries\n and newspaper articles and findagrave.com. You build this family tree back until you get two of these relatives of the Golden State Killer, you get them to intersect. Where now you see, oh they've got, they share great great grandparents.\n together. Theoretically, Golden State Killer is a descendant from those same great-great-grandparents. So once I identify that common ancestor, it's now identifying every single descendant from those great-great-grandparents.\n This becomes a huge process. People in the 1840s would typically have 15 kids. You have to identify each of those kids and then all of their children and then all of their children. So now we have this exponentially growing family\n tree. How wide did that tree get? I think we had over a thousand individuals in that family tree, but we knew a lot about our offender. We were confident. It was bored between 1940 and 1960. We knew he was\n a white male. We knew he was 5'8 to 5'10. You know, he's in California. He's up in Sacramento in 1976. He's in Southern California in the 80s. We basically narrowed it down to about five males and then it's just investigations.\n With a suspect at their fingertips this spring, they followed him to a Sacramento area hobby lobby store and took a DNA sample from his car door handle. Days later, investigators recovered another DNA sample from one discarded tissue\n which registered a match to DNA evidence left at one of the crime scenes.\n yesterday and he is believed to be the so-called golden state killer. For 44 years countless investigators have worked it and have failed to solve it. Within four and a half months a team of six\n were able to figure out who the Golden State Killer was. And that was Joseph D'Angelo. After the Golden State Killer was identified, the floodgates opened. And we were seeing every week, not only single killers, but multiple killers, serial killers,\n Every week were being identified from cases in the 70s and 80s.\n And there's going to be more because it's working and we are going to help find these people. But the scary thing is in the US you have a hundred thousand cold case murders with DNA. You have more cold cases.\n the ones with DNA is estimated about 100,000. There's roughly about 650,000 sexual assaults. With DNA. With DNA. This seems like a real paradigm shift. It is. Multiple law enforcement agencies have said that\n this is the most revolutionary tool they've had since the adoption of the fingerprint. With traditional DNA, it required getting a sample from the actual individual. It's a one-to-one\n type of process and so these these offenders who let's say they have committed crimes and haven't been caught and they're just living their life and They're thinking well my DNA has never been taken from me So they may I may have left DNA in the case that I committed bad\n in 1975, but they've never gotten my DNA. They won't find me. But now, we don't have to rely upon that. Somebody, distantly related to that offender, has put their DNA into a database,\n And they have to start getting nervous because that's outside of their control. They can't account for a third cousin and what that third cousin is doing. And so they start getting nervous. And I've kind of wondered how many of these individuals recognize that law\n Each person who uploads their information to a database illuminates the identities of hundreds of other people around them.\n siblings, aunts and uncles, and cousins. A study by AncestryDNA found the average person in the UK has 175 third cousins. And it doesn't stop there. The DNA in one\n person will be shared by hundreds of people yet to be born. Children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, and cousins once or twice removed. Realistically, each person shares identifiable\n DNA with nearly a thousand people, past and future. So it doesn't take many people uploading their data to reveal the identities of everyone living in a country. Back in 2018, a study found that\n using an existing database of just 1.3 million people they could identify 60% of all Americans of European descent and they estimated with a database containing just 2% of the population you could find a third\n cousin or closer match in 99% of cases.\n that keeps the DNA good for a long time? We have DNA samples in here that are probably about 15 years old. How many samples are stored in there? Just over 2 million. Wow! Yeah, so the capacity is just over 2 million.\n million people's DNA stored in this one small room? Correct. Wow. By 2021, over 30 million people worldwide have taken a direct consumer genetic test, the majority of which are through ancestor\n and 23andMe, which do not currently work with law enforcement. But Family Tree DNA does. If you ask Americans, should we have a national database where everyone's logged in it? That's their DNA. Yeah.\n by their DNA and their name, most Americans will be somewhat uncomfortable or potentially very uncomfortable with that. But we're kind of sleepwalking into that scenario. There are some people who are concerned with privacy. If anyone chooses or decides\n that they do not want their results to be used for law enforcement matching. They can remove themselves from that. I do worry about genetic information being used to discriminate against someone. My biggest thing is health insurance. I worry about\n If you have somebody's DNA profile and some laws enacted gets at the wrong hands and they say that this person has a proclivity they're headed towards Parkinson's they're headed towards this head towards that and then rates skyrocket.\n That's the biggest place that I see as a privacy concern.\n And our information isn't ours in the first place. Our information is shared. Yes, with your relatives. And although you may be adverse to this sort of thing if they've already done it, in a way you're out there.\n In society today, you very clearly have two camps. There are those that are very comfortable having their genome available to be able to be searched for law enforcement purposes, and there are others that are not comfortable at all. And that's okay.\n The problem is, of course, those people who don't want theirs to be searchable could have their DNA uploaded inadvertently by their relatives. Do you know what I mean? So like if I don't want my DNA to be searchable by law enforcement, but my sister\n uploads hers. It's almost as good as me doing it myself. Right now, Family Treaty and AIDS policy is we will only accept samples from law enforcement under certain circumstances.\n It has to be a sexual assault, identification of remains, DNA recovered from the scene of a homicide. And we also do child abductions. So if there's a child that's kidnapped and there's DNA evidence,\n we will process the DNA so they can try to find out who the abductor is. Those are the only cases that we will accept. Unfortunately now, GEDmatch has flipped off the switch and GEDmatch has actually\n said that you don't have to have your information searched without opting in. Right. Was that decision by Jed match a direct result of this Golden State killer case. No it wasn't. You know it had to do with a\n case. But it wasn't a sexual assault, but it's a serious crime.\n But Jedmatch's\n Terms of Service said they would only help law enforcement in cases of rape or homicide.\n But people within the genealogy world kind of got\n got their passions in flame saying that is stepping outside of what this tool should be used for and they ended up putting a lot of pressure on GEDmatch. They flipped the switch because they got freaked out. But at the end of the day it was a violation of terms of service and I think\n Subsequently, Jedmatch was sold to Verigen.\n match, about 73% of them are signing up to allow law enforcement to search. We're pretty happy with that. Yeah. I mean, that's a high number. It's a high number. And it suggests that people want that, in a sense.\n cousins or third cousins do you know, you know what I mean, you don't know that many of them without even knowing it. You're helping justice you're helping a victim's family. Get a little bit of peace not closure, but a little\n bit of peace. Why not? Partly you can make an argument that if you want to be an activist helping catch criminals, one of the best things you can do is like encourage everyone you know to be tested and put in the data.\n Correct. And, you know, there are millions of people who have tested at other companies that are not working with law enforcement. And if they want to help, all they have to do is\n download their raw data and they can upload it for free into our database.\n crimes committed against us. There has to be an equal balance. That scale of my privacy has been taken because of a third cousin has been identified versus a mother who's talking about her daughter has been murdered. That scale of\n is way the hell like this.\n and all the concerns with it will probably end up in front of the nation's Supreme Court and there will be a decision. My bottom line message, if you're going to make a decision, if there's going to be laws restricting law enforcement to use it, make sure that you're making\n an informed decision and not assuming what it is based on its DNA and genetics and law enforcement because it really isn't what you think it is. I gotta keep a couple million people happy so that I have access to the identities\n kind of, in a sense, of hundreds of millions of people. And that's a pretty selective sample. These are people who are willing to give up their information to find their ancestors. There may be many others who are militantly private.\n But they don't get a say in the decision of whether they're going to be searchable through that person or not. True. That's the choice you make. So that to me... That's the choice you don't make. It's a choice you don't make, but it's also...\n the\n public safety with the public privacy. Is Duck Duck Go, is that good? I use it, I'm a little paranoid. So it's supposed to not track you as much, I guess.\n Yeah.

I think they are because yeah, I mean like a lot of people have come up with like, you know cancer tumors around the ear area recently and I think that's too much of a coincidence to not\n be involved with the mobile phone usage. I think that it does but it doesn't affect my day to day life and you know where I put my phone and I still carry it in my pocket even though I might get cancer in my leg I mean it's not changing my life. UV rays.\n Gamma, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma. Alright, let's take a closer look at these examples. They are all in fact types of radiation. Assuming by mobile phones we mean the waves that they transmit.\n But there are some important distinctions between these different types of radiation. For example, alpha and beta rays are actually tiny particles moving very fast, whereas the rest of these types of radiation are very small particles.\n are all waves very similar to light. So let's arrange them by particles on the right and waves on the left. Another very important distinction is between the radiation that can do damage to molecules like DNA\n and radiation that can't. So let's rearrange the radiation into these groups. So the damaging radiation includes UV rays, X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha and beta particles. So sunlight\n So where is most of your exposure to damaging radiation coming from? Well, for one thing, there are radioactive isotopes in the solar system.\n and in the air that we breathe, so we get a very low level of background radiation from these sources. Also, every time we take a plane trip, we're exposed to higher levels of what's called cosmic radiation, which are particles that are streaming towards us from outer space.\n Normally these are blocked out by the atmosphere, but at the high altitudes that planes fly at, we're exposed to more of this radiation. Every time you get an x-ray at the dentist or to check for broken bones, that also gives you a significant dose of radiation.\n But generally the levels of radiation that we're exposed to are so low that it's not worth worrying about. Bananas are radioactive. Why is that? They have potassium 40. And so if you eat too many bananas you can get ratings of a...\n Geiger counter. Do you eat bananas? I do eat bananas. I love bananas. I'm still fine, I guess. It never puts you off the thought that it could be radiating you. It's kind of cool, to be honest. Like radioactive powers or something."

I think that it does but it doesn't affect my day to day life and you know where I put my phone and I still carry it in my pocket even though I might get cancer in my leg I mean it's not changing my life. UV rays.\n Gamma, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Gamma, Gamma. Alright, let's take a closer look at these examples. They are all in fact types of radiation. Assuming by mobile phones we mean the waves that they transmit.\n But there are some important distinctions between these different types of radiation. For example, alpha and beta rays are actually tiny particles moving very fast, whereas the rest of these types of radiation are very small particles.\n are all waves very similar to light. So let's arrange them by particles on the right and waves on the left. Another very important distinction is between the radiation that can do damage to molecules like DNA\n and radiation that can't. So let's rearrange the radiation into these groups. So the damaging radiation includes UV rays, X-rays, gamma rays, and alpha and beta particles. So sunlight\n So where is most of your exposure to damaging radiation coming from? Well, for one thing, there are radioactive isotopes in the solar system.\n and in the air that we breathe, so we get a very low level of background radiation from these sources. Also, every time we take a plane trip, we're exposed to higher levels of what's called cosmic radiation, which are particles that are streaming towards us from outer space.\n Normally these are blocked out by the atmosphere, but at the high altitudes that planes fly at, we're exposed to more of this radiation. Every time you get an x-ray at the dentist or to check for broken bones, that also gives you a significant dose of radiation.\n But generally the levels of radiation that we're exposed to are so low that it's not worth worrying about. Bananas are radioactive. Why is that? They have potassium 40. And so if you eat too many bananas you can get ratings of a...\n Geiger counter. Do you eat bananas? I do eat bananas. I love bananas. I'm still fine, I guess. It never puts you off the thought that it could be radiating you. It's kind of cool, to be honest. Like radioactive powers or something."

            "transcription": "Okay, they're about to lock me in here and then use these electric coils to make magnetic fields that rotate. They're roughly the strength of Earth's magnetic field and we'll see if my brain is picking up on the fact that the\n magnetic field is changing. The whole time I will have my eyes closed, it will be pitch black in here, basically no stimuli except for the changing magnetic field and I'll keep my head perfectly still facing forward. Does that sound good?\n about eight minutes. Eight minutes, perfect. Okay, I'm ready when you are. But before we do this, let's meet the researchers. Can you introduce yourself? My name is Shin Shimajo. I'm a professor in neuroscience and experimental psychology at here Caltech Biology.\n Connie, you are the first author here and your paper has just been published when this video goes out. So what is the setup of the paper? How do you set this up? So basically we\n It has long been recognized that certain bird species have a remarkable ability to find their way home, hence the use of homing pigeons\n to carry messages for us. Their impeccable sense of direction is owed in part to their ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field. But they are not the only animals that do this. Certain bacteria, bees, salmon, turtles,\n Rats, dogs, whores, cats, all of them are known to have magnetic compass. Dogs, known to poop with their bodies oriented preferentially north-south, have even been trained to locate bar magnets.\n Given a choice between three containers, they were much better than chance at identifying the one containing the magnet. In fact, they were much better at finding a magnet than finding a food treat under similar conditions. Given all these examples, it seems more likely that humans should have\n the ability to detect magnetic fields. And if you're wondering how humans could physically pick up the magnetic fields, consider that magnetite crystals have been found in the brain that closely resemble those of magnetically active bacteria.\n But up till now, the evidence has been contradictory and controversial.\n So in the early 80s, Robin Baker did some studies where they took groups of students and drove them around in very convoluted routes around the English countryside. And they were blindfolded and then they would stop the bus and\n asked the students to identify which direction they came from, to basically home. And they got pretty significant results from that. Shortly afterwards, maybe a few years afterwards, this study was attempted again at Princeton University.\n and they did just a very similar experiment there and they couldn't get significant behavioral results there.\n So this is the test chamber and I'll turn on the light.\n So this is our... Is that the way we get in? Yes. Exactly, that's the way you have to crouch in. So I'm going to crawl under there. Yes. You sit down there.\n Hang on a sec, hang on, this is too cool. I really like it. Whose chair is that? It just happened to be Joe's reclining chair. I'm not used for this purpose, but\n it turned out it's very relaxing. And the main reason of this cage is to shield the outside effect for one thing and also have a good control over the modified Faraday cage where electricity is running.\n no sound or vision or tactile or any other additional stimulation because we are tapping onto very subtle response of the brain at the subliminal, subconscious level. It doesn't block the earth's magnetic field. The earth's magnetic field goes straight\n through this. And that's actually sort of what we want because inside the chamber we're not trying to override the earth's field, we're just trying to redirect it, just to add a little bit of field here and here, remove a little bit there. And by doing that we can\n smoothly move the field back and forth and move it in a way that relates to how someone might experience the field as they're sort of moving around outside. So that's essentially what you're simulating in here.\n Because you're making it as though my head is swiveling around in the Earth's magnetic field. Yes, except that if you're actually doing it in the real world, then your vestibular system is also sending signals. We are not interested in contamination from vestibular\n Can I hop in there and just have a look?\n I mean, I feel like for my job I have been in more weird, um, sand proof boxes than most people.\n coils here? Do these create the magnetic field? No, no. So those are for a different experiment. So the magnet coils are actually these things. Those are the magnet coils. And you can see there's four of these square coils in all three\n directions and this is a nested three axis coil set and it's designed to create a magnetic field in any direction inside the chamber and in the center of the chamber where your head and torso is going to be.\n It's designed to create a uniform field, so a field with no gradients or curves in it. I've brought a compass and so I can just see if the magnetic field is changing. What's going to happen when I sit in this room?\n Okay that was a pretty dramatic shift. So there will be two kinds of rotations one is clockwise and one is counterclockwise and as a control on some trials on the magnetic field won't change at all so we can compare on trials what happens after\n field rotation versus trials where no field rotated. So this is the sort of thing that I'll be experiencing but in the dark? Yep. Now we're gonna want you to use your left hand to hold it here because it's easier to put on the cap. On this cap there are 64 electrodes.\n which will pick up the electrical activity of my brain. And you're sure this isn't just to make people look stupid? Oh, no, no, no. When you're awake with your eyes closed, the dominant signal is called the alpha wave. In most people it occurs around 10 Hertz. These little squiggles\n right here they're happening at around 10 times per second these are the alpha waves. We are measuring your alpha wave which is known to be an indicator of relaxing and sometimes even drowsy but not sleeping and then when you notice something like in visual\n So the goal of this experiment is to determine if a magnetic\n field rotation causes the amplitude of alpha waves to drop.\n I'm going to turn off the light and then we just do this with a stool. Turn off all the lights in the room and we close the doors.\n And throughout the experiment I'll be listening in and watching the video for safety reasons. Can you hear me? Yes I can. I'm setting up the experiment. We'll be starting shortly.\n wait for the ding ding. The experiment is starting. You can see that's our starting point in terms of direction. It will vary from two preset values.\n Yep, so you can see there, that was a field rotation. Okay. This is like one of the more glamours. Ah, there we go. That's what I was not meant to hit. Thank you.\n This is a section of my raw EEG results. You can see that every 3 seconds\n the field was rotated either clockwise, counterclockwise, or it was fixed, meaning it didn't change. Now it's impossible to draw conclusions just by looking at this, so the scientists average over all the trials in the different conditions and plot the alpha power over all\n the electrodes. This is a recording from someone who is particularly sensitive to changes in the magnetic field. As I play this, watch how the clockwise and counterclockwise responses compare to the fixed field result. The recording starts before\n rotation. The magnetic stimulus takes place and now observe the post stimulus response, particularly for counterclockwise. For this subject, the counterclockwise rotation resulted in a clear decrease in alpha power of at\n least 3 decibels shown by the dark blue color. This corresponds to a decrease in alpha power by around 50%. Now here are my results. After the magnetic stimulus, my response to counterclockwise\n is clearly not as pronounced. But over time for clockwise rotations my alpha power is reduced. I was told I was neither the most sensitive to\n magnetic fields nor the least sensitive, I was somewhere in the middle. So the conclusion is that our brains have ability to sense molecular field change but it's implicit and subliminal. It's non-conscious part of the brain.\n This is just the first step to make sure that it's not theoretically impossible that our ancestors might have utilized this ability for their navigation. Even the modern people like ourselves may potentially have it. This will open up the\n window for the next stage research as to how we could bring it to the consciousness, how could we strengthen them, and how could we utilize it. As yet, it's unclear if anyone can actually make use of this sense consciously or subconsciously.\n to help them navigate. But the study's authors point out that a surprising number of human languages lack terms like front, back, left, and right, and instead use cardinal directions, north, south, east, and west. Native speakers of\n Such languages would refer to a nearby tree as being to their north, rather than being in front of them. Individuals who have been raised from an early age within a linguistic, social, and spatial framework using cardinal reference cues might have made associative links with\n geomagnetic sensory cues to aid in daily life. In other words, people from such cultures may be conscious of their magnetoreception. They would be very interesting to test. But if it turns out that this sense is no longer functional\n in humans, just a relic from our ancestors, it would be interesting to consider why we lost it.\n So it's possible our internal compass\n may be a victim of our modern technology. This study does not show that magnetic fields have some kind of special influence on you, that they don't cure disease, they don't make you smarter.\n You can't communicate telepathically or something through them. So these are the types of emails that Connie does not want to receive. Just so everyone's clear, in case you've got sort of a crazy idea, my hair still looks stupid.\n But in case you have a crazy idea for what to do with magnetic fields in the human brain, this study does not support that. No, it does not support that. It only supports that the human brain can pick up on the physical stimulus of the Earth's magnetic\n field. Yup. Which in itself is a super cool finding. It is a super cool finding. It's like just the basis for future research because you know you can't have any behavior without some kind of\n something going on in your brain.\n you"

            "transcription": "This video is about one of the most important questions. What leads to a happy life?\n They don't care about having money and that money can't buy happiness, but that's really not true. Because I would rather cry on a yacht than in a, like a Subaru. Clearly, having a successful career in financial wealth are important to\n people. In a survey from 2018 of around 100,000 college freshmen, about 55% said they wanted to be successful in their career, and 83%\n reported that they wanted to become rich. But do these accomplishments really increase happiness? Well that's what I want to find out in this video. But how do you study what makes people happy? Well, you can ask them. What's going to make you happy?\n But people aren't really good at judging what will make them happy. Winning the lottery seems like it should make you happy, but numerous studies on lottery winners find that\n After the initial surge of happiness wears off, many are no happier than the rest of us. Some are in fact more miserable than they were beforehand.\n The problem is that people's memories aren't reliable.\n Most studies on happiness find older people and ask them to recall what made them happy. But as we've just seen, memory is unreliable. So a better way to conduct the study would be to follow people throughout their entire lives,\n capturing the choices they make and how those affect their happiness. That is really hard to do. But there is one study like this that's been running since 1938. Now, 85 years is a long time to run a study, so it has been passed.\n passed down from one generation of researchers to the next. It's currently run by its fourth director, Robert Waldinger. What is the claim to fame then of the study? You know, the claim to fame is that it is, as far as we know, the\n The study actually began as two separate\n studies by two groups of Harvard researchers that didn't know about each other. The first group followed 268 young men from Harvard to find out how they would develop into early adulthood.\n The second group studied 456 boys from middle school onwards from Boston's poorest and most disadvantaged families.\n Eventually, the two studies merged into one, the Harvard Study of Adult Development. At the start of the study, the participants were interviewed\n and received extensive physical examinations. And as they grew, they entered all walks of life. Some of them became bricklayers and doctors and factory workers and lawyers, and one even became President of the United States.\n Every two years, researchers ask them questions about their lives, like, if you could stop working without loss of income, would you? What would you do instead? How often do you feel isolated from others? True or false, life has\n more pain than pleasure, and other questions about their marriage, career, friendships, and their physical and mental health. While the study started with just 724 participants, over time their spouses and children were also included in the study.\n So, how many people are we talking about in total who have been part of the study? Between 2,500 and 3,000 people altogether in the study. And as technology improved, so did the methods of data collection.\n now draw blood for DNA. You know DNA wasn't even imagined in 1938. We measure messenger RNA, DNA methylation. We bring people into our laboratory, we deliberately stress them out\n and then see how quickly they recover from stress. Looking at heart rate variability, for example. Looking at cortisol deposited in hair because that seems to be a long-term measure of circulating\n cortisol. But all of these new methods are in the service of studying the same big phenomena of human well-being. So what do 85 years of research across entire\n human lives teach us about a healthy and happy life.\n A Taiwanese study looked\n at the medical data of 416,000 healthy people between 1996 and 2008. Eight years later, they followed up with each person to look at the link between exercise and mortality. They found that people who exercised just 15 minutes a day had a 14%\n reduced risk of dying and a three year longer life expectancy. Every additional 15 minutes of exercise decreased the risk of dying by an extra 4%. A large meta analysis from 2008 confirms that people who are physically active have a reduced risk of\n dying during the time frames investigated in each study. Exercise also protects our cognitive health. A meta-analysis from 2014 found that participants with higher levels of physical activity had a 35% reduced risk of cognitive decline\n and a 14% reduced risk of dementia.\n It's not just the Harvard study, there's now a whole list of studies that show the importance of relationships to human happiness and health. They teach us three main lessons. The first is that relationships are great for our health.\n Researchers looked across 148 studies with a total of more than 300,000 participants. They found that on average people with stronger social connections had a 50% increased likelihood of survival for any given year. Being married in particular has a\n large impact on how long people live.\n live seven years longer on average than unmarried women. Marriage is always a better deal for men on all parameters than it is for women. And it's not because you have a marriage license, right? It's because people living together\n in an intimate partnership tend to keep each other healthier. You have somebody who's kind of watching looking out for you. It's a very real concrete effect. If feeling well connected to others makes us happier,\n healthier and extends our lives, then what happens if we feel disconnected?\n of the physical effects of loneliness and her calculation was that being lonely is as dangerous to your health as smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day or as dangerous as being\n Feeling disconnected from others also makes you more prone to disease. A large meta-analysis from 2016 found that poor social relationships were associated with a 29% increase in risk of heart disease and a 32% increase in\n risk of stroke. One caveat is that most studies on the health effects of loneliness focus on people aged\n And loneliness is on the rise.\n The UK has a point\n appointed a minister of loneliness. Many, many countries are concerned about this breakdown in social connection. A question about loneliness, like what does that look like? Because obviously\n Everyone experiences some periods of loneliness. So, you know, what is when does it become sort of really detrimental and how do we define that? Well, loneliness is different from being alone. Right. So you can be alone and quite content and many people\n people are. In fact, the ability to be content when you're alone is quite a skill and it's a wonderful ability. Loneliness is that subjective experience of being less connected to people than you want to be. And that's\n That's why you can be lonely in a crowd. We're all on a spectrum between extraversion, wanting lots of people in our lives, and introversion. Actually needing a lot of solitude and\n not wanting a lot of people. A lot of people are stressful for introverts and what we know is that neither one is healthier. Right? The introverts are perfectly healthy and they just may need one or two really solid relationships\n So the second lesson is that it's not how many people you know or see or even whether you're married or not, because a bad marriage can be worse for your health than\n getting divorced. Instead, it's about the quality of your close relationships that matters.\n predictors at age 50 of who's going to be happy and healthy at age 80 as opposed to sick or dead. And we thought we were going to be looking at blood pressure and cholesterol level at age 50 as the strongest predictors. It was their relationship.\n It was particularly their satisfaction with their marital relationships that was the strongest predictor. And relationships don't just keep us happier and physically healthier, they also protect our brains.\n People who are in secure relationships in their 80s, where they feel that they can rely on the other person, find that their memories stay sharper for longer. And people who feel lonely? Well, their memories fade quicker. A study of retired US adults\n found that the rate of cognitive decline was 20% higher over 10 years for those who felt lonely. A meta-analysis from 2018 further confirms the detrimental effects of loneliness, finding that it also increased the risk of dementia.\n A big open question. What is it about the relationships that makes them particularly helpful or helpful? The best hypothesis for which there's some pretty decent research now is that\n that relationships are emotion regulators. They're stress regulators. So stressful things happen every day to many of us, right? So then what happens? Well, the body goes into fight or\n flight mode, blood pressure goes up, respirations become more rapid, circulating stress hormone levels rise. But then the body is meant to go back to equilibrium after that normal fight or flight response when we face a challenge.\n If I can come home and there's somebody here to talk to, I can literally feel my body calm down. What we're pretty sure happens is that people who are isolated, that they're more likely to stay in a kind of\n chronic fight or flight mode. And that what that means is that they have higher levels of circulating cortisol, higher levels of chronic inflammation, and that those things gradually wear away body systems.\n So that's how, for example, chronic stress can predict coronary artery disease, but also arthritis and also type 2 diabetes because of this common\n The key to preventing this breakdown is simple, just spend a little more time with the people you care about.

There is an alarming trend in our society. Social engagement with friends decreased from 60 minutes a day in 2003 to\n just 20 minutes a day in 2020. The technology has fundamentally changed how we interact with one another and how we communicate with one another and unfortunately has often replaced what used to be rich in-person connections with\n Now, you may say you're an introvert and you don't need to spend much time with people to feel good. And while it's true that introverts and extroverts need different amounts of social stimulation, both need human\n In 2015, Holt Lundstad and her colleagues looked at the data of 70 independent studies, with more than 3 million total participants. Similar to other studies, they found that the subjective feeling of loneliness increased the risk of premature death by 26%.\n But they also looked at the objective measure of social isolation, how much time you're actually spending with other people. And they found that social isolation increased the risk of premature death by 29%. And unfortunately, introverts are more at\n risk of being socially isolated.\n Many people who were the happiest were those that leaned into their relationships with their partner, friends, family, and community. And when they were in their 80s, the researchers asked them, what are you most proud of and what is your biggest regret?\n that they were proudest of something to do with their relationships. So it could be, I was a good boss, I was a good parent, I was a good friend, I was a good mentor. Nobody said I made a fortune.\n right? Nobody even said, you know, I won the Nobel Prize, which a few people did. It wasn't about those badges of achievement, right, that we think of as, oh, that's what we got to get to feel like we've had a meaningful life. Everybody looking back,\n mentioned their relationships. The biggest regret was particularly among the men because this was the World War Two generation. They said, I wish I hadn't spent so much time at work. I wish I had spent more time with the people.\n So what about our original question? Do achievements and money really make us happy? Well, according to the Harvard study, badges of achievement do not necessarily make us happier. But doing meaningful work\n can. And what about money? Does that make us happier? There's a famous study from 2010 by Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton that found that above an income of around $75,000 a year, there is no improvement whatever in the measures of emotional well-being.\n But 11 years later, Matthew Killingsworth studied data on 33,000 employed US adults, and he found that higher incomes corresponded to higher levels of well-being. So he wrote,\n $35,000 a year, contrary to some influential past research. In 2022, Kahneman and Killingsworth set out to resolve the conflict with Barbara Mellors as a mediator. When they analyzed Killingsworth's data, they discovered an interesting pattern.\n Depending on how happy people were relative to others, earning more resulted in different increases in happiness. For each income level, they divided people into groups based on their happiness, low, medium, high, and so on. They found that below a threshold of roughly\n However, for all the happier groups,\n higher incomes do seem to lead to more happiness. And the real twist is that those who were the happiest to start with stand to gain the most with increasing income. Relationships, meaningful work, and money all play a role in our happiness.\n So why can it be so hard to realize just how important relationships are?\n We don't think about that as something you cultivate in order to make yourself happy. We don't think about that at all. And yet when we study it scientifically we find that that turns out to be an enormous predictor.\n of happiness as well as physical health. What's going to make you happy? Being wealthy is definitely a big aspect of it, but that loving family is kind of like the\n foundation of it, you know what I mean? Realistically money, but like building deep connections with people are what's going to make me happy. That's awesome. Having like good relationships with other people. You raise a family. Have a family and provide. Friends and family. Seeing my family happy, that's all I\n really care about. Giving back to the community where you came from the world. A strong family base just to come home to every night. I want to get married, have a ton of kids. How many is a ton? Probably like five or six. As many as I can afford.\n In fact, when I interviewed people, I was pleasantly surprised to see how many identified the importance of relationships. So if you could give people advice on what to start doing today to start being happier.\n What suggestions would you make? To think about it as analogous with physical fitness. If you go work out today, you don't come home and say, I'm done. I don't ever have to do that again. Right. It's like a practice. Right.\n that the people who were best at relationships were the people who made it a practice day after day, week after week to stay connected to the people they cared about, you know, to talk on the phone, to go for\n walks, have coffee, to do whatever, to play basketball. The people who took those actions again and again regularly were the people who stayed very connected and stayed happy that way.\n What we propose is that this is a practice we can cultivate and that there are tiny actions that people can take. We have many stories of people who thought\n that they were no good at relationships, that they were never going to have happy lives. And then it changed. And many times it changed when they didn't expect it. So, like we have a story about one man who\n really didn't have a good marriage and was kind of distant from his kids, didn't have any friends, and then when he retired he joined a gym and he found this group of friends that became for the first time a kind of tribe\n for him. And that's just one example of how our lives take these twists and turns that we usually can't predict, that we don't expect, and many of those turns are in positive\n The message that the science tells us is don't give up on this aspect of your life because many things can change at any age.\n you"

I mean, they all cluster right up against the carousel so people behind them can't see their bags and then when you do spot your bag, you have to push through all the other passengers to collect it.\n and usually bump into them as you're grabbing your bag off the carousel. Why is it that people behave so badly? It doesn't seem to matter which airport you go to anywhere in the world, the problem is the same. And this problem, believe it or not, is related to why trees are tall.\n Go with me on this.\n through a mature forest knows that the lower part of a tree has basically no branches and leaves.

But of course, if there was a mutation that allowed a tree to do this, you know what would happen to it. In a forest surrounded by all these taller trees, it would be shaded from the sun\n and so it would wither and die. But what if all of the trees developed the same mutation? What if they all created a friendship pact, a forest of friendship in which everyone agreed not to grow such a big trunk to start the leaves\n right at the ground. Well that would mean every individual tree would be better off. The trouble is, this solution is not stable. Because any tiny mutation that results in a tree that's slightly taller would advantage that tree. It would be able to capture more light and it\n would shade its neighbors and so pretty soon it would have more offspring it would come to dominate the forest and then any additional mutation down the line would result in even taller trees. This is how trees got so tall. I mean they\n keep getting taller until the cost of going one more foot is exactly equal to the benefits of collecting that additional sunlight. And that is why trees are as tall as they are today. I mean it's not an optimal solution, it's not like these trees have the\n best use of their energy, but it is the one that is stable. So the point is, although it's in every tree's best interest to be a part of this forest of friendship, it will never work. It'll never last. Because any individual who gets\n a little bit taller is going to ruin it for everyone. And it's the very same thing where you go to collect your bags. I mean if everyone could agree to stand a couple meters away from the carousel, everyone would have a good view of their bags and be able to easily step forward and collect their luggage. But of course one\n person standing forward is going to block the view of people behind them so everyone's going to rush forward. It's an unstable solution just like the forest of friendship. So remember next time you are frustrated collecting your bags at the airport remember trees know just how you feel.\n I'll summarize the whole problem for you.\n I can hear you, ready?"

            "transcription": "So this is like the world's most important freezer. It is, really. The most important room in the world, someone has said. These are pretty big claims for a place located just\n just 1300 kilometers or 800 miles from the North Pole. But then this is no ordinary place. It's the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Well actually this, this is just its front door. Inside the Seed\n are a series of tunnels. It's not actually that cold right here, but as we go deeper it is only going to get colder. This is Bente. You're an engineer Bente? Yes I am. You're gonna show us where to go? Yeah. Fantastic.\n How many doors are there? Five doors to the secret room.\n Oh, that's what I'm talking about. You spread the lengths of tunnel that take you down into the sea vault. This facility was built to last around 200 years and withstand earthquakes and explosions. It was placed on the side of a mountain so\n even if all the ice on earth melts, it will still be above sea level. There are three separate vault rooms where seeds are stored, but only one of them is in use right now, and it's buried over 120 meters from the front door. The whole point of\n putting the vault so deep in this mountain is to put it within permafrost. So all around me the earth naturally stays around minus four or minus five all year round and that way if something did happen\n and the coolant stopped flowing here, there was no power, then, well, behind these doors, it would still remain probably, you know, minus four or minus five Celsius forever. Assuming, of course, global temperatures don't rise, though.\n much. This place is sometimes called the Doomsday Vault because even in a worst-case scenario it should preserve the diversity of the world's food crops.\n Here is a cross tunnel that leads to three vault doors. Vault number one is up there. Vault number two, and this is the one that's actually being used. And then vault number three. It's pretty amazing to see.\n look up and see ice-covered ceilings and walls everywhere. This fallbar global seed vault works essentially like a bank vault. It's almost... Yeah, because the seeds lay in boxes like this.\n These boxes are sealed when they come to Svalbard and none of us can open it. We put it to the security system at the airport just to check that it isn't any explosives or anything. But it works like a bank book.\n We can't open this. Only the depositor can open and take out their seeds. So you don't open any of the seeds, any of the boxes that come here? No. Well, how do you know that people are really depositing the seeds like barley that they say they are and not other things?\n Just because they have signed a contract that says it. We can't be sure but of course we trust them. Would there be seeds for some crops that people might consider illicit like marijuana? That is said that that shall not be in here, no.\n No drugs and also no gene modified material. No genetically modified seeds go in here. Yeah, Norway has asked for that No, not the genetic material is kept in here. Are there any particularly strange crops? Has anyone deposited anything that's really\n odd or weird? No, nothing weird is in here, but we have, we get some questions from people who want to put in their own private seeds. I also have had\n had had letters from men wanting to put their gene material in here that is really strange and and we don't answer those this is the door to the vault and behind here there are nearly a million\n different varieties of seeds from all over the world, kept at minus 18 degrees Celsius. You know how I can tell that it's minus 18 degrees in here? You can actually feel\n The moisture in your nose freezes so your nostrils get all stiff. Yeah. And I see behind you we have some Canadian seeds. Which is exciting for me because I am Canadian. So what sort of things do we have from Canada?\n I'm really not sure because this box on the outside doesn't tell what is in it. But these numbers here are connected to a database on the internet. So you can go in there afterwards. There you go. You can go find out.\n You can find out what has Canada got stored in the seed vault. What are we looking at right here? It's like a bank vault except everything that you've put in there is publicly available. Yeah, it is. These are the coolest boxes I think. They are from North Korea.\n Oh my goodness. They look like they come from the 1960s or something. They built them specially because they got the measurements of how big should the boxes be.\n are built exactly on those measurements. And here you see North Korea is placed on the same shelves as the USA is just on the back there. It's on the backside. And you have South Korea just on the back. So here they are like in small\n So these are the last few bare shelves in Vault 2. Once the other two vaults are full, there will be around 3 million\n different species of plants stored here with over 500 seeds per sample. So one day there may be over a billion seeds stored inside this mountain, representing the vast majority of Earth's agricultural diversity.\n og seksualiteten.\n climate, wetter climate, whatever is going to happen. So that is why it's so important to have a backup of all these seeds so that you are sure that you can also grow the food we need for the next generations to\n But this isn't the only seed bank on earth. There are around 1700 other gene banks around the world run by different countries and organizations. And at a cost of 9 million dollars to build this fall-barred seed vault and millions more to run it, it's\n It's worth asking whether this is a costly redundancy or a valuable insurance policy. And perhaps the best people to answer this question are the Syrians who last year were the first to make a withdrawal from the seed vault.\n is now out of order. It's been bombed. So one third of the material that is kept in here is now taken down to Morocco and Lebanon. And this is some of the material that now has been returned. So to get the material\n Over the last 13,000 years we have cultivated millions of species of plants. The agricultural revolution underpins\n the technological and population explosions that made our modern lives possible. The risk of a real doomsday scenario is incredibly remote, but whatever happens, thanks to this outpost at the top of the world, at least our seeds,\n are safe. Hey, I'm currently on a train traveling from Washington DC to New York City so I can't talk too loud. And actually after Norway I went to Seoul, South Korea,\n Los Angeles, Boston, New York, and Washington. So it's been some crazy travels for me. And on all of these travels I've been listening to audiobooks from Audible who also support Veritasium, which I'm very thankful for.

Those are pirates.\n These are two ways of making a living. Now, what's the best thing to be? A fisher or a pirate? And the answer is that it's not obvious because it depends what the rest of the population are doing. If the whole population is fishing,\n then it could very well be that an individual could mutate and become a pirate because there's plenty of fishing going on and it's easy to steal a fish. So then you might say, well, a natural\n The natural selection then favours piracy, the gene for being a pirate, spread through the population. In a few generations, now everybody's a pirate and there's no fish. So piracy is not stable, it's an unstable system.\n It's evolutionarily unstable. Fishing might also be unstable because if the whole population is fishing, then a mutant pirate invades. So a stable strategy\n is a strategy such that when all the population are doing it, no mutant individual could arise, which would do better. So neither fission nor pirate in my hypothetical sort of game is evolutionarily stable.\n What might be evolutionarily stable is some kind of ratio. It might be 80% fishers and 20% pirates, something of that sort. And the definition of stability in this case is when they're doing equally well. A well-known example\n is the sex ratio, where any departure from the stable sex ratio is penalised by natural selection. If there are too many males, an individual is better off having daughters and if there are too many females in the population, an individual is better off\n having sons and so the stable ratio is 50-50 or strictly speaking it's 50% investment, economic investment in sons and economic investment in daughters.\n The evolutionarily stable strategy is a strategy which cannot be bettered by any other strategy provided that everybody else in the population is doing it.\n years ago when this channel reached half a million subscribers you guys asked me who would I like to meet and I answered Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins and since then Bill Nye has taught me how to tie a bow tie I got to interview Richard Dawkins\n and on August 22nd and 23rd I will be hosting Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney in Canberra.

And it smells us, lets us know. At home when the shark is here. And at the same time we also hope to get a tissue sample from the shark that we tagged.\n Why is that important to grab a tissue sample? A couple of studies we're doing are looking at the genetic populations of the different sharks of the world. Even in Australia we're finding there's two different genetic populations. Also we can work out what the shark's been eating recently.\n Wow, but before you can tag a shark you have to entice it close to the boat. Well it's morning and we're just about to have breakfast, but I thought I'd come out and have a look at the sharks breakfast. Yeah, that is what we're gonna be leeching overboard to a trans\n We just threw the bait in and waited about two minutes and a shark came up and grabbed it. I was trying to film the seagulls around the bait when it hit. It was incredible, just unbelievable to see how fast they arrived here.\n The sharks are here and they're biting. The goal is not to feed the sharks, but to pull the bait away from them before they can get it. Oh man! That's a big shark.\n As a storm rolled in, it was my chance to observe the sharks on their own terms underwater. I'm just trying to make a nice seal with my mask.\n so I don't get any water in. That means heaps of Vaseline on my mustache. Feels disgusting. Today we've got pretty stormy weather and the sharks have fired up a bit. This is the weather that suits them for predation with the sea lions.\n Not so good for us, we're all cold and wet but yeah, good conditions to show. That's awesome. Thicker, even thicker. That's just gross. You're like at the top of me. Yeah, that's how it's gotta be. Have fun. Thank you.\n Thank you.\n That is great.\n From the cage you can see the sharks that have already been tagged. And you get a different perspective on what it's like to pull food away from a shark tank.\n mouth. In real time you can see just how fast they can strike. That was a pretty incredible\n surreal experience. This you drop in there and it's a whole other world. And it's funny you don't really feel scared of them just maybe it's the cage but you know they just look so docile and peaceful. So how hard is it to stick one\n is in the dorsal fin. If I can get a shark in really close and get the right shot they make it pretty easy when they swim past the back of the platform here. There it is.\n It's slightly going away, it has a ton of present.\n Come on Come on With the light fading tagging was put on hold until tomorrow and that gave me a chance to talk to the researchers about\n why this research is so important. Before protection they were hunted for sport, they were hunted for their jaws and they were hunted just out of fear. Everybody was scared of sharks. You know the jaws movie, the jaws phenomenon, it created\n awful lot of fear of these animals. Sharks were mindless killers. People just wanted them out of the ocean. Population numbers basically crashed. And this research is essential to help their numbers recover. We have to find out how many sharks are out there. We have to find out\n where they travel to, where they breed, that's one of the holy grails that no one knows. Where do they give birth? We don't know that either. No one's ever seen them breeding, no one's ever seen them giving birth. And if you can't protect sharks in those key areas, then you're not going\n really be able to have much of an impact across the population as a whole.\n Looking good guys, looking good.\n Yeah! Woo!\n and a tissue sample. It's great the science. You know we've begin to scratch the surface with satellite tagging. We always thought white sharks were a coastal species. We found that they are able to\n to do dives well over a kilometer deep. They frequently dive off the edge of the continental shelf. They go and inhabit niches out in the open ocean for months and months and months on end. So this whole myth that they are this coastal creature has been completely debunked with\n the advent of this new technology. It's one of those things with these animals that if you ask a question and you conduct your research and you answer your question and then you have five more questions that have arisen from that answer.

There are an estimated 200\n 250 million preschool age children who are vitamin A deficient. Most of them are in Africa and Southeast Asia like here in India. Of those about 250,000 to 500,000 are severely vitamin A deficient. When that happens\n they get night blindness, which means as the sun goes down, they lose their ability to see. Now if you catch the condition at that point and give a child just a few high dose vitamin A supplements, their sight can be restored within 24 to 48 hours.\n hours. It's like a miracle cure. But if you don't, well the condition can continue to worsen until they're completely blind. And of those children who are completely blind, roughly half die in the following 12 months.\n These are all things I learned while working on a new feature length 90 minute documentary called Vitamania all about the scents and nonsense of vitamins. And I am not only the presenter of this documentary, I'm also one of the co-executive producers.\n and you can watch this documentary right now it is live on the web for everywhere in the world except France and Germany because it's coming to your TVs but I will put a link to it Vitamania the movie in the description and right here and I want to show you a\n for this film so you get a sense of what it looks like, what it's all about. It's something I've been working on for two and a half years so I'm really proud of it and I just want you to go and check it out. So here is the trailer.\n In 1913, Antarctic explorers Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were fighting for their lives. With most of their food gone, they faced a stark choice. Eat their dogs or die.\n After reluctantly eating their dogs, the men fell ill, burning with fever.\n days Mertz was dead. Mawson, against the odds, made it back to camp. So what was the mystery illness that killed Mertz and nearly cost Mawson his life?\n Well, when they ate their dogs, they weren't just eating canine flesh and fat. They also ate the dog's livers, which contain high levels of vitamin A. So basically, they overdosed. It's a condition known as\n known as hypervitaminosis A. Hypervitaminosis A is rare but deadly, and today we know it can be caused by overuse of high dose vitamin A supplements, the same kind\n of supplements that can save a child's sight. This power and complexity lies at the heart of the great vitamin story.\n I'm embarking on an epic world-spanning investigation of vitamin science and history.\n That is one big fish. I want to know how we discovered them. You're sure this is safe? What they actually are. The 13 vitamins can be divided into two teams. How we learned to build them.\n Walgreens and Target have pulled the products nationwide and how safe they are all vitamins all nutrients They are toxic in high amounts. We go to start taking these seriously as we should with every chemical we put into our bodies I'm a scientist\n I'm also a father, and I want to know how do I do the best for my son? And one day, might he be taking vitamin pills to Mars?\n Across the world, some experts claim that taking vitamins can be lifesavers, whereas others argue that it's just a waste of time or even dangerous. So how are we supposed to know whether to take them or not?\n So I hope you enjoyed that trailer if you want to check out the film you can click right here or the link down in the description\n I really hope you like it.

But I don't actually think that's what happens. In truth, I think the eye\n jumps from image to image as it moves across this scene. So I'm going to try to find a volunteer to help me demonstrate that. What I'd like you to do is scan across this landscape as smoothly as you can.\n Tell me about the process of scanning across, you know, from the point. It just feels like you're stopping and going and then like stopping and going and yeah it feels like there's like\n like there's a pause all the time constantly when you're going across. It's not like you're just looking straight across. Yeah, it's not smooth. The eye is capable of tracking smoothly, however. If something moves across your field of view, your eye can lock onto it and move smoothly\n with it. What I'd like to do is I'd like to repeat that little game but I would like to ask you just to walk across on those rocks and then I'd like you to just like follow her along with your eyes. Is that possible? Yeah. Okay let's give it a shot. You want to go over there? Okay.\n Alright, go for it. Can I just get your reaction on what that was like? How was that the same or different? That felt a lot smoother because I was following something instead of just\n looking at something. Yeah, I don't know, just like if you follow something, your brain focuses on that one thing and you just kind of just go with it. Why would that be useful to be able to pan with a moving object?\n How does that affect our perception of motion? Well, I think it makes most motion seem quite smooth and makes it more difficult for us to determine when things are accelerating. One last question since I've got you guys here. So what I want to do is I want to drop the ball. I want you guys to watch it.\n then tell me how the ball moved. Is that fair enough? Watch it till it hits the ground and then afterwards you're gonna tell me how it moved. Okay three two one. I'll do just one more\n Three, two, one. Could you tell me about the motion of the ball? What was it doing as it went down? It's fast. I don't know, it just seemed like it just\n dropped but it wasn't even moving you just seen the ball drop to the floor and that was it you didn't see it like here you just saw it from there to there yeah would you say its speed was constant or do you think its speed was changing constant yeah it was the same yeah\n The whole way down. Yeah. No acceleration. The goal of my whole experiment today, I'll let you guys in on a secret, is to point out that the eye tracks motion very smoothly. So when the ball like goes down is really easy for us to track that. Yeah. And it looks like it's just doing one\n But in fact it is speeding up the whole time. When I release it, it's not moving at all. And when it hits the ground, it's actually going quite fast. So that was kind of my point. If you scan across like a stationary scene, then your eye is doing this weird jumpy thing. But then if you\n you're actually moving with an object or with a person or something, then your eyes are so smooth that you don't even notice. Yeah. But something that's still and you have to move, that's when it starts to jump. But if it's moving, your eyes have to follow that. It's much easier. Yeah, I understand now. Excellent.\n you"

            "transcription": "The world is full of mysterious places you can see from high above using Google Earth. But what's really going on down there, and why?\n I'm Derek Muller, a scientist, educator, and filmmaker, and I'm going to unearth the stories behind these amazing places. Just drop a pin, and I'm off.\n I am here in the middle of the Utah desert surrounded by sandstone cliffs and red rocks and this scrub, but that is not what I'm here for.\n What I'm looking for should be right over this ridge.\n There are electric blue ponds in the middle of the Utah desert. When I saw them on Google Earth, I had so many questions, like, what are they? Why are they here? And why do these colors keep changing? One person asked me,\n thought this might be a top-secret NASA experiment, since after all, you can see them through space. Someone else suggested, well, maybe they're just really large swimming pools. What are those? What do you think?\n The truth is far more fascinating\n than any of those guesses. These Technicolor pools are full of something that's been prized throughout human history. What are they used for, and how are they connected to fireworks, George Washington, soap, glass, Gatorade, gunpowder,\n a pioneering scientist named Humphry Davy, every other person on the planet, and lots of money.\n The answer begins with a pot and a hardwood fire. This is a 1,500-year-old recipe. Take some hardwood and burn it, not for the heat, but for the ash. Put the ash in.\n in a pot and add water. Now, there are a lot of different chemical compounds in there, but the one I'm after is water-soluble, so it dissolves. Strain out the solids, and you'll find the solution is slippery.\n Put it in a pan and let the water evaporate in the sun. And what you're left with is this crystalline substance. All that work for this. It is one of the most important chemicals people have been making for centuries.\n And it's called potash because that is exactly where it comes from. In 1807, British scientist Humphry Davy got some damp potash and put electrodes into it. Then he connected them up to a battery.\n And what he observed was the formation of tiny metal globules. And as they burst through the crust of the potash, they spontaneously caught fire. Davey had discovered a new element. So naturally, he named it the...\n Potashium. Potashium. Yes, that is where the name of the element comes from. It comes from the potash. When you hear the word potassium, many people think of potash.\n bananas or Gatorade. And that's true, these foods are good sources of potassium, but it's not pure potassium. This is a piece of pure elemental potassium. It's a metal, but I can squish it with my fingers.\n And this had to be created in a lab because it is so reactive, it'll react with anything. This piece was kept submerged under oil so it doesn't react with the water in the atmosphere. It's an incredibly reactive substance. And to demonstrate that,\n I'm going to put a piece of it in this water. I'm going to weight it down so the potassium doesn't just sit on the top, but actually will sink down to the bottom. Three, two, one. Oh, yeah!\n Oh, yeah! I did not expect it to do that. That is awesome. Are you kidding me? Yeah! Of course, I've seen this\n demo before but never with such a huge explosion. I think the key was weighing it down so it didn't\n just spark on the surface. Potassium reacts with water, forming potassium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also releases a lot of heat. So when the hot hydrogen gas hits the atmosphere, it spontaneously combusts.\n Potassium is so reactive because it has one electron in its outermost shell, which is easily removed. And that's why we never find metallic potassium in nature. Now, the word potash originally referred to that stuff as a chemical.\n which chemically is potassium carbonate. But potash has become a catch-all term, referring to lots of potassium-containing compounds. So the potash that Davey was using was actually potassium hydroxide. And this is not the last time we're gonna hear\n from Dave. But why is potash so important to people? I'm on the trail of potash. Look at that.\n All right. This is bacon grease. For centuries, it was used in making soap. Mm-mm. Take some animal fat.\n add potash and the chemical reaction creates a primitive liquid soap. And look at that, this is incredible. I'm getting a real lather going here. That's not bad. Take a look at that. The potash soap actually worked.\n Potash was also used to make glass. Glass is mostly sand, silicon dioxide. But add some potash and you reduce the melting point. This makes glass less brittle and easier to work with in early furnaces.\n If you take the potash solution and add\n or manure, crystals of a different potassium compound form, potassium nitrate, also called saltpeter. And it's one of the core ingredients in fireworks and gunpowder.\n Get ready. That was awesome.\n in the muskets and cannons of battles fought in China, Europe, and the American Revolution.\n Potash was by far the main chemical product of the early American colonies and a substantial source of revenue. By 1788, there were 250 potash works in the state of\n of Massachusetts alone. Places where wood was burned on a massive scale just for its ash. In 1790, the newly independent U.S. government issued its first ever patent. It was for an\n an improved process for making potash. The patent office has now issued over 10 million patents and the literal first one is for potash. It was signed on July 31st, 1790.\n the signature. It's signed by none other than president George Washington. That should give you an idea of how important potash was. The demand for potash was\n was so high that across Europe and the eastern U.S. forests were decimated. Unfortunately, it required a huge amount of lumber to create just a small quantity of potash. Then in 1861 in Germany, they\n They started producing potassium from a different source. They found it not in plants or any living organism, but in a rock. This is potassium chloride in its natural mineral form.\n Now this also gets the name potash even though the name originally referred to ash in a pot potassium carbonate. It changed everything. Germany established a near monopoly in the potash supply. They had so much of the\n that they started looking for new uses. Well, they did experiments sprinkling this stuff on farmers' fields, finding that this acts as an excellent fertilizer. That's because potassium, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, help crops grow far less.\n larger and makes them more drought resistant. The downside was in 1910 just four years before the start of World War one the Germans cut off potash exports to the world. Their preemptive\n first strike was depriving the world of potassium, something countries had become dependent on to feed their growing populations. The U.S. became so desperate for other sources of potassium that in 1911, Congress appropriated\n to find domestic sources. Sites discovered near Searls Lake, California, Carlsbad, New Mexico, and Moab, Utah became potash pay dirt.\n But the potash rocks weren't on the surface. They were deep underground. So potash had to be mined out.\n But how did it get here in the first place. I'm meeting Mike Cornell up a Moab guide who knows the history of this area.\n So the layer that the potash is found in is called the paradox formation. And it was created by an inland ocean that kept retreating, returning, retreating, and returning. The water would evaporate and leave behind the potash.\n salt and other evaporates like potash. Salt in the ground is very much like an air bubble in water. Geologically, it wants to float. It's literally pushing up against the crust here. And they used to\n harvested underground like coal, you know, scraping it out, throwing it on the narrow gauge rail up to the surface. But salt also likes to trap oil and gas. And there's oil and gas in this area. And I believe it was 1963.\n As they were mining the potash, they hit a pocket of gas, and there was a big explosion, a major loss of life. This tragic explosion occurred at 440 in the afternoon on August 27, 1963.\n The fire was put out by a fire that killed more than 15 men died. Investigators concluded the disaster was caused by the ignition of combustible gas by electric arcs sparks or an open flame.\n could ignite the natural gas leading to huge explosions. But there was an invention made to prevent such explosions, an ingenious lamp. This wire mesh disperses the heat from this flame rapidly enough\n to prevent igniting the gas outside the screen. This is called the Davy lamp after its inventor and also the discoverer of potassium, Sir Humphrey Davy. Without the Davy lamp, the candles could ignite methane in the air.\n in the mine. And if a mine is full of methane and something ignites it, well, this is what it looks like. Okay, guys, let's do it. In three, two, one.\n Wow. That was incredibly fast. Can I watch that back? This footage is shot at a thousand frames per second.\n It ignites down here at the bottom. Once that spark takes hold, all that gas is burning, and as it does, it releases heat, which causes the gas to expand.\n And so it accelerates through all the shafts of the mine, getting faster and faster all the way up to the top. You know, unlike out here in the atmosphere where, you know, combustion can dissipate and there's a lot of fresh air that can rush in, in the mine,\n you just have that methane gas. Once there's a single spark, it basically sets the whole place ablaze. Mining is one of the most dangerous professions. So if you don't have to go down in a mine, it's better not to.\n A year after that fatal explosion in 1963, a mining company based in Saskatchewan, Canada stumbled upon a safer way to mine potash.\n What they do at that mine is they pump water from the Colorado River deep underground. It goes down 3,900 feet. That is where the potash deposits all\n Now that water dissolves the potash salt, so we get a briny solution down here. Then they get forced back up to the surface where that brine solution is pumped into these ponds. Here, the water is pumped into these ponds.\n evaporates into the air, leaving you with that potash that you wanted to get. In a sense, the water molecules are like your little miners going in there to get the potash out so you don't have to. These are the ponds.\n that we're looking at. It's a nice drone, man. So you trust me to fly this thing? I was thinking if we do some dual operator. OK.\n so I can fly it and you'll have full control of the camera. Google Earth gives you this bird's eye view, right? But you're so high, it's tough to...\n it makes sense of it. But it's really from here that you can see what these ponds are all about. You have the hot Utah sun and this dry air. So these are evaporation ponds.\n They're evaporating the water off to get to that salt, to get to the potash, which is in the water. And it just looks so beautiful from up in the air. There are 23 ponds spread over 400 acres, and it takes\n months for each one to evaporate there are two billion tons of potash in the paradox basin alone and at an average price of three hundred and thirty dollars a metric ton the potash harvested here could potentially generate billions\n of dollars. The color of these ponds changes over time. A full fresh pond is a deep blue color. But over time as that water evaporates and it gets shallower,\n where we see seafoam green ponds. And further along the line, you get these sort of tan-colored ponds. Ultimately, when all the water is gone, you are left with this white crystalline substance. That is the potash. And they scrape it up with these vehicles.\n But if the punish crystals are white then why do these pawns appear so blue. The answer is in here it is copper sulfate see those copper sulfate crystals.\n crystals? Well, if I add them to the water, they dissolve, dyeing the water blue. So the copper sulfate is in the water because it prevents the growth of algae.\n and other living organisms. Plus, it's this dark blue color, which absorbs more sunlight, more energy from the sun, and that helps the water evaporate faster.\n If you can believe it fertilizer now supports half of the world's population every other person owes their existence in part to innovations like this the harvesting potash and other\n minerals that are essential for the growth of our food. But increasing the efficiency of growing food doesn't just mean this planet can support more people.\n It also means that they can explore different ways of life. You know, before the advent of agriculture, when our ancestors lived as hunter-gatherers, we spent all day, every day just finding food. But once we could grow our own crops,\n and these days now that we can do it so efficiently with the help of fertilizer that totally changes the game it frees up most people's time to do other things to be artists and musicians and sports people and science communicators.\n So potash itself is irreplaceable. It has helped us make the modern world what it is today. And that's what these blue ponds have to do with George Washington, Gatorade, fireworks, Humphry Davy,\n every other person on the planet and untold riches and how gunpowder glass and so. All came out of a pot that was filled with ash and water centuries ago. In today's digital world few miss\n But there are some. What is this strange horse doing in the middle of the British countryside? Why does this mountain look like a person? And what is this abandoned city off the coast of Japan?\n That's where I'm headed."

            "transcription": "Now I'm going to turn on 2000 volts. Whaaat? This is the first step in creating snowflakes in the lab. This is totally wild! What?! Crazy, huh? The tips of those needles are like 100 nanometers in diameter. That is so wild.\n Dr. Ken Liebrecht is the snowflake guy.\n The U.S. Post Office made snowflake stamps using my pictures. It's not the kind of thing you normally think of when you start doing physics, that you'd be on a poster stamp. You've written the book on snowflakes literally. So I had like two successful books in a row.\n So we just kept making books until finally they sold zero copies. And then we stopped. So you're kind of like a snowflake artist.\n I call it designer snowflake. Because yes, I am designing this on the fly. I don't have a computer that does all this for me, I just do it by hand. So everyone's a little different.\n Ken knows so much about snowflakes, he can design and\n construct them to his own specifications.\n the humidity a little bit, the super saturation, and you'll start to see branches come out there. So you changing those conditions just caused the plate to kind of stop and become really... I changed the growth conditions to prefer branches.\n This little thing right there, that little nub, that's the only thing that touches the sapphire substrate. The rest of this is all growing above. This increases the airflow. Those are droplets forming and now I'm really kicking it in gear.\n Now I'm going to turn that humidity down to zero so the droplets will start to recede and this will stop growing and kind of start to facet a little bit. Say I want branches again, now I'm going to\n Really hammer on it. So you're giving it a lot of moisture. A lot of moisture now, but you'll see side branches. You really start to feel you understand what's going on when you can say, now I'm going to do this. And then it happens.\n It's fun, I can predict the future. I like to think they're better than nature. And the reason is that the facets are just sharp, all the edges on these things are just sharp and crisp.\n The first close-up photograph of a snowflake in the wild\n was taken in 1885 by American meteorologist Wilson A. Bentley. It was Bentley who originated the idea that no two snowflakes are alike, and he would know. Over the course of his life, he took more than\n 5,000 photos of snowflakes, a selection of which appear in his book Snow Crystals, which is still in print today. But most snowflakes don't look like the ones Bentley photographed, because he selected only those\n in pristine condition with uncommon beauty and symmetry.\n We are also used to seeing pictures like this, that we are blind to the mysteries of the snowflake. Like, why do\n Why do they all have six-fold radial symmetry? Why are they so intricate and yet so different from each other? How do opposite arms of a snowflake mirror each other so perfectly? How does one side of the snowflake know\n But the mystery goes\n even deeper. Everyone pictures snowflakes like this, but the truth is they take all sorts of different forms. Like this. A hollow column. That is a snowflake. That is a snowflake. There are also needles.\n cups and bullets. This is like my favorite kind of snowflake is a capped column. It started out growing as a column, but then the temperature changed and then you've got plates growing on either end.\n It's just a cacophony of different shapes. All of these appear spontaneously. There's no DNA or any kind of blueprint for what's going on. It's just water vapor freezing into ice and all this happens.\n You've identified 35 different types of snowflakes. Yes, there's no really one way to define a type of snowflake. The first chart of snowflakes is like 41 I think and then it got bigger and 60 or\n The latest one by some Japanese physicists, I think had 108 different types of snowflakes. And I found 108 was too many. How does simple ice create snow?\n So many distinct forms. All snowflakes form in much the same way. Water evaporates into water vapor, individual molecules bouncing around in the atmosphere, and as this vapor rises, it\n water molecules condense onto dust particles to form tiny droplets, and although the temperature may be below\n When the water is freezing, the droplets don't immediately freeze. But at some point, one droplet will freeze. Inside, the water molecules lock into place, forming a hexagonal crystal.\n Results from the peculiarities of water molecules Oxygen atoms attract electrons more than hydrogen and since the molecule has a bent shape It's polar with oxygen being slightly negative and the hydrogens slightly positive\n Since, unlike charges attract, hydrogen from one molecule will sit next to an oxygen from another molecule, forming a so-called hydrogen bond. And this is what creates the hexagonal molecular lattice.\n this microscopic lattice grow into a hexagonal crystal that we can see?\n surfaces, and at a molecular scale they're very smooth and flat. And so when a molecule hits, a water vapor molecule hits that smooth and flat surface, it tends to bounce off. Whereas here, it's rough. There are a lot of dangling molecular bonds\n over here. That's a rough surface. And so when these molecules hit, they tend to stick. It's a statistical thing, of course, but the probabilities are high that they stick here and low that they stick here. So if you take any shape and you just let it grow for a little while, the\n The rough areas fill in and the flat areas don't grow very fast and you end up with a faceted shape. And that's how we get from the quantum mechanics that governs a water molecule to a hexagonal prism of ice.\n This prism has two basal facets and six prism facets, which is important. If the basal facets grow fast, you get a column. If the prism facets grow faster, you get a flat snowflake.\n Once there is a seed crystal, nearby water droplets evaporate and deposit water molecules onto the growing snowflake. Since the corners of the hexagonal prism stick out farther into humid air, they grow faster.\n And now they extend even farther, so they grow even faster in a positive feedback loop. This gives rise to six radial branches. At the corners of these branches, additional branches can form\n the same reason. Around 100,000 droplets are required to make a single snowflake, and the process usually takes 30 to 45 minutes. In the 1930s, Ukihiro Nakaya was systematically\n studying snowflakes at the University of Hokkaido in Japan. He discovered that the different types of snowflakes don't all occur under the same conditions. Instead, two factors, the temperature and level of supersaturation,\n determine what type of snowflake grows. His findings are summarized in the Nikaya diagram, but it's not a simple pattern. Around minus 2 Celsius, you get plates. At minus 5 Celsius,\n columns and needles form. At minus 15 Celsius, it's plates again. And then below minus 20, you get columns and plates. The Nakaya diagram allows us to understand a rough history of any snowflake.\n Does each snowflake in essence reveal its history through its shape? Yeah, absolutely. To some degree. You can definitely look at a snowflake and say, yeah, I know what conditions that crystal grew\n under more or less typical weather patterns, fronts, cold front. That produces a lot of capped columns because the cloud moves up, it starts to get colder and initially start to freeze at around minus six, minus ten, that makes columns.\n And as it gets colder, then it makes branches and plates, and so you get capped columns. This also explains why snowflakes are so intricate. The temperature and humidity at each moment of growth determines the structures formed in that moment.\n The symmetry you see is not because one side somehow knows what the other side is doing, but because both sides of a single snowflake grow in the exact same conditions.\n will change, say, and all six branches will see the same temperature change, and so they'll all respond the same way. Different snowflakes, on the other hand, each take a unique path, and therefore they experience a unique set of conditions.\n conditions, which is why no two snowflakes are alike. But in the lab, you can carefully control the conditions, so theoretically it should be possible to create almost identical snowflakes, and indeed, can\n has.\n I'm going to put a little sapphire disk in there and then I'm going to push this thing all the way in here and the crystals will loft onto it and hopefully stay there. The idea popped in, it's like if I go to next to one another they'll be kind of identical.\n And I call them identical twin snowflakes because they're like identical twin people. They're not exactly the same, but clearly more alike than you would ever expect.\n Is it really true that no two snowflakes are alike? That's just a silly question. It's silly because no two trees are alike, no two grains of sand are alike, no two anything are alike, anything that\n has any complexity is different from everything else, because once you introduce complexity, then there's just an uncountable number of ways to make it. If a pair of twin snowflakes are growing too close together, they end up competing\n for moisture between them, stunting both of their growths. The Nakai diagram allows us to understand a lot about snowflake formation. Ken has used his experiments to build his own version of the chart, but what did\n doesn't explain is why do ice crystals form this way in the first place? I mean, why do we get plates and then columns and then plates and columns again? This has been a mystery essentially since Nikaiya introduced his diagram back in the\n But Ken believes he now has an answer. Anytime you have a crystal, the reason why you get these smooth, flat facets is because it's not easy to grow more crystal on top. There are so-called nucleation bases.\n barriers. What you need is a critical density of additional molecules of the substance before they can come together to form a little island that is stable enough to grow and add another layer onto the crystal. When you're first forming a snowflake, you're always going\n to start with a hexagonal prism with its two basal facets and six prism facets around the side and the nucleation barrier for the basal facets is different than that of the prism facets. If the nucleation barrier is lower for the prism facets then\n they grow faster and you get plate-like structures. If the nucleation barrier is lower for the basal facets, then they grow faster and you end up with column-like structures. Now the nucleation barriers of ice are known as a function of temperature and this\n This explains why around minus two the prism facets grow faster and you get plates because their nucleation barrier is lower. You can also see why below minus 20 or so, well then you get columns because the basal facet nucleation\n is lower at those temperatures. But what doesn't make sense is why we should get columns at around minus 5 Celsius and then plates again at minus 15. So what is happening? Well, Ken's hypothesis is that these nucleotides\n Nucleation barriers are valid only for large flat facets, but if you had really narrow facets, the nucleation barriers would be different. So Ken proposes that narrow basal facets have a dip in their nucleation barrier around minus 4 Celsius,\n narrow prism facets have a dip at minus 15. So his hypothesis is that the graph should look like this. This then is consistent with all the different forms of snowflakes that grow at different temperatures. But what accounts for these dips?\n Well, let's say we have a narrow prism facet, so we're growing a plate snowflake. Water molecules that hit the basal facets are unlikely to reach the critical density required to overcome the nucleation barrier. So that surface grows only slowly.\n But on either side of this narrow prism facet, water molecules can stick on the rough edges. And to minimize surface energy, the ideal shape of this face would be semi-circular. But if only the top few layers of water molecules are mobile,\n Meanwhile, to try to lower the surface energy, many of them diffuse onto the prism facet, and in the process they exceed the critical density required to overcome the nucleation barrier, and so they can grow the crystal on the prism facet.\n edge the nucleation barrier is effectively lower than it would be for a large prism facet. A similar effect happens for the basal facets just at a different temperature and Ken has done experiments to investigate whether these effects are observed\n in the lab.\n So far, the results agree nicely with the hypothesis. So after 85 years, maybe we now understand the molecular physics of ice well enough to finally explain why snowflakes\n grow into such a diverse collection of columnar and plate-like forms.\n those black holes are going to be used for? No. Saturn's rings. Why do you care about Saturn's rings? What's the motivation for studying Saturn? Nobody asks that. Every time I give a talk people are like, what are you doing? What on earth is this for?\n I tell you the real reason, the real reason that I got into this. You look at a snowflake and you kind of go, um, actually, we have no idea how that works. Well, that's just not, that doesn't work. We have to know how that works. Damn it.\n Well, I want to be the guy who figures out how snowflakes work. That's always been a driver.

Let's go see how they do it. Alright, so come on in man. This is without a doubt the most dangerous room in the country. You're currently surrounded floor to ceiling with venomous snakes.\n And the only thing that keeps the snakes in is those little locks. Yeah, just the little locks and the thin glass.

Now because my hand's starting to cramp up, I'm gonna put him away so I'll get you guys to jump back for me and this is the sketchy bit. Yeah? When you get him out you got the hook, when you're putting him back, it's just who's quicker.\n Ready? Your hands trembling a bit? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Every time. So how much venom do you actually need to make anti-venom?\n Venom evolved from saliva and it's used primarily for catching and digesting prey. Each species of snake has a different venom, tailored to the specific\n Now why the rear tooth, you might ask? Well, it's because the venom gland itself\n In some species, evolutionary pressures caused the fangs to move closer and closer to the\n the front of the jaw, improving the snake's ability to catch and kill prey. While the location of the fangs was evolving, so were the fangs themselves. They started off as smooth, ordinary teeth with venom flowing down the outside.\n But over time, some snake lineages evolved a groove in each fang to channel the flow of venom. In some species, the groove became deeper and deeper, eventually closing in to form a hollow tube, and now the teeth literally\n But this is not the norm. Only one seventh of the world's snakes have hollow fangs. But of course, almost all the venomous snakes in Australia do have hollow fangs, so we set up this macro shot to take a closer look.\n This one's rolling, that one's rolling. We're ready when you're ready. Perfect. Everyone's ready? Yep. Wow.\n Wow, it's got like jets. Jets of venom coming out. Has this guy not been milked in a while? Yeah, it's been a little while. Not only do we have some of the most toxic snakes on the planet here,\n We also selectively breed them for the production of anti-venom. They're bred to produce more venom than their wild counterparts. So some of our coastal typhans are producing five, six, nearly seven times what their wild counterpart would. And that's just from selective breeding. You find your two most psychotic ones, you put them together, you hope\n for the best and the absolute worst comes out. So it keeps you on your toes. That sounds horrendous. So you're saying that these are the most venomous snakes in the world and then you have bred them to be more venomous. Yeah, they're super snakes.\n We spoke to venom expert Timothy Jackson, who argued these snakes produce more venom because they are regularly milked.\n unlike wild snakes. Either way, the snakes in this room contain more venom than virtually any others on earth. We house the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, and about the twelfth or fourteenth most toxic depending on who you talk to.\n One bite from a king cobra contains enough venom to kill 13,000 mice. We know this because of a study from 1979 that tested the venoms of 25 different species of snake on lab mice. From this, we can estimate that the venom from one\n King Cobra Bight could kill around four humans. Though to be precise, we'd have to say four human-sized rodents, because thankfully no one's tested these venoms on humans. And by this measure, the most venomous snake in the world is the\n inland taipan, which conveniently lives in the middle of Australia. A bite from the inland taipan has enough venom to kill half a million mice, or more than a hundred humans. So yeah, why not milk that\n that one next.\n So quite a lot smaller than the last couple of animals we've used but makes up for it in toxicity. Very very quick and very naughty when he wants to be. But an absolutely gorgeous pattern. You can grab that bit for me mate. Yes. I'm gonna grab this vial from behind you.\n And as you can see, he's very keen on the killing. There we go. That is extraordinary. The most venomous snake in the world. Just incredible animals.\n That was quick. Yeah those ones make me proper nervous. I don't know about you guys but I'm sweating. Can you see the hands? The moment I stop doing that after a milking is the day I quit.\n The concept of the most venomous snake is complicated, because snakes evolved their venom specifically for potency against their usual prey. In turn, their prey evolved resistance to their venom. The honey badger, for example, is almost completely\n immune to cobra venom. So the lethality of a bite depends on the snake, the animal that got bitten, and the amount of venom injected. The reason scientists test different venoms on lab mice is to get an estimate of the amount of\n venom that would be required to neutralize a bite. Snake venom is lethal to us because we are closely related to snake's main prey, rodents. Rodents and primates split on the evolutionary tree only 75 million years ago.\n So we share a lot of the same biology, from the structure of our cells, to the way our blood clots, to how our nerves send signals. Venoms typically target very conserved molecular pathways that exist across maybe all\n vertebrates or maybe even the entire tree of life in some cases. There are four ways that snake venom can kill you. It can be neurotoxic, damaging to your nervous system and brain by interfering\n with neurotransmitters, the signaling chemicals that go between neurons. It can be hemotoxic, thinning out your blood, preventing wounds from healing and causing internal bleeding. It does this by disturbing the delicate machinery of the blood coagulation system.\n Venom can also be cytotoxic, attacking cells leading to severe blisters, necrosis, and cell death. It can also be myotoxic, destroying muscles and causing paralysis. The worst part is that snake venom\n can contain up to 200 compounds. Most venoms contain a combination of neurotoxic, hemotoxic, cytotoxic, and myotoxic proteins. This is what makes snakebite so difficult to treat. It's not just one toxin you're trying to\n neutralize, but dozens all working together to try to kill you. I've been at the park for 10 years this year. I've been running this\n facility for seven and a half eight. Have you ever been bitten? Yeah so about three and a half years ago I got a scratch. One finger got nicked that was 36 hours\n in ICU and eight of those are on a resus bay. So very, very serious. And what was that experience like? That was crappy. As it turns out, I'm highly allergic to antivenom, which is not ideal. I started swelling up, looking like the elephant man. So then they whack you with adrenaline to cancel out the anaphylaxis.\n So what is antivenom exactly, and how was it invented?\n In 1870, a British military doctor, Edward Nicholson, was stationed in Burma. And as he watched the local snake handlers, he noticed something strange. They would, from time to time, deliberately get cobras\n to bite them, in what he considered a form of tattooing. Nicholson reasoned that they were intentionally exposing their bodies to the venom to develop an immune response. He observed that the older snake handlers were less affected by accidental\n than the younger ones. So this dangerous practice seemed to be paying off. 20 years later in Saigon, a French medical researcher named Albert Calmet was vaccinating local residents against smallpox.\n When he became aware of the threat posed by cobras, he wondered if it was possible to make a vaccine for snake bites. Back in Paris, he tried injecting rabbits with a tiny amount of cobra venom, starting with just .03\n milligrams, but each week he injected the rabbits again, slowly increasing the dose. And after 8 months of this, the rabbits were receiving 35 milligrams of cobra venom at a time. That is 15 times the normal lethal dose.\n in rabbits, but they were still perfectly healthy. The rabbits' immune systems had developed antibodies to neutralize the venom. So you can be vaccinated against snake bites just as you can against disease. But who wants to be vaccinated against\n against all different types of snakes, just in case one bites you. It would be better, Kalmett reasoned, if you could administer antibodies after a bite. So he drew blood from a venom-resistant rabbit and isolated the serum, which contains the\n antibodies, and then he injected it into another rabbit that had never been exposed to venom. When he subsequently injected it with twice the lethal dose of Cobra venom, the rabbit was just fine. Immunity had been transferred from one\n one rabbit to another. This was the first antivenom, or as the Frenchman Calmet called it, antivenin, which is why my phone always makes that auto-correction. To this day, antivenoms are made in much the same way.\n At the reptile park, they collect and freeze the venom. It's sent off to be diluted and injected into a donor animal, usually a horse. Horses are used because of their size. After increasing the dose over a period of months, the horse\n This builds up immunity to the venom, and then its blood is drawn and the antibodies are isolated. Only the plasma is taken, the red blood cells are returned to the horse. Those horse antibodies are the life-saving antivenom.\n Venom works for the same reason venom works, because of our shared evolutionary history with other mammals. The antibodies produced by horses are very similar to the ones produced by humans, so they bind to toxic compounds and neutralize them even in our body.\n But this way of making antivenom has downsides. Collecting the venom is dangerous, many donor animals are involved, and some people are allergic to antivenom. Scientists are now exploring the possibility of producing antivenom\n antivenom using genetically modified bacteria. They would produce the specific antibodies needed to neutralize each toxin in a venom. But for now, this is the way antivenom is made. How's your arm? It's a bit sore, the shoulder's a bit tender.\n The work Zach and others like him do saves countless lives all around the world.\n the animals and this is an opportunity to not only work with the animals you love but to actively be a part of saving lives. Like I'm not smart enough to be a doctor, I'll just put that out there straight away but I can swing a snake pretty good.\n Hey, milking snakes is a very hands-on activity, and so is learning with this video's sponsor, Brilliant.

            "transcription": "Part of this video is sponsored by LastPass. More about LastPass at the end of the show. This is a video about research into slowing the rate of aging and extending the human lifespan. So before I filmed this, I wanted to know\n So, what do you guys generally think about such research? And I made a Twitter poll where I found that the majority of people were supportive and thought there should be more of it. But there were some important concerns and I want to address those here at the beginning. I mean, the most significant concern was\n If we're looking to extend human lifespan, does that just mean we'll have more sick years where we'll be in bed with Alzheimer's? Nobody wants that, and that was clear to me. But the professor that I was interviewing for this video, Professor David Sinclair, points out\n that as you get older the risk of horrible diseases things like diabetes and cancer and Arthritis all those sorts of things it increases exponentially and so if this research is successful\n The whole point of it will be to forestall those sorts of diseases. I mean if you really are tackling aging then you should also see that those age-related diseases do not set in so quickly. So the point\n The point of slowing aging and extending human lifespan is to extend the healthy lifespan, also called the health span. The other concerns I saw were that people were saying, well, this could be used only for the wealthy and increase inequality,\n or it could increase the population of the earth causing garbage, more CO2, where are the resources to feed all these people? I think these are valid concerns, but they're not part of the scope of this video. So if you want to discuss them in the comments, feel free.\n But the point of this video is to address can we slow aging in humans? Can we extend the lifespan and the health span? And what does that look like? How do we do it? Okay, so for this video I traveled up to the Bodega Marine\n lab, which is north of San Francisco, and there I got to see some moon jellyfish. Now what's fascinating about these moon jellyfish is some people consider them immortal. How can that be? So all these jellyfish have this complex\n life cycle where they start off as a polyp which is basically like a small sea anemone and then they'll go through a metamorphosis and become a medusa and the medusa stage is what we generally think of when we think about a jellyfish and in most of these species the polyp\n Helps are generally able to asexually reproduce and they can regenerate if tissue is cut off of them or if they're damaged and they don't have any clear evidence of senescence, which is the term for biological aging.\n So they appear to have some degree of immortality. No one had reported their ability to do this until I think this was 2015. So do moon jellyfish hold the key to slowing aging and extending our lifespan? Could they help us live forever?\n Before I got into making this video, I would have put this sort of research in the same category as downloading your brain, your consciousness, into a computer. Like I can see how maybe that would work, but I don't\n think we're anywhere near that because we don't even understand how the brain works or how memories are stored so that seems like serious science fiction so I would have put say extending the human lifespan to 120 150 and beyond in the same category but after\n After reading Professor Sinclair's book and doing an interview with him, I think it seems much more possible and in fact plausible that we'll make some progress over controlling aging in our lifetimes. Now if you want to slow aging,\n The first question you need to answer is why do we age in the first place? I mean, what really is aging? I've made a video in the past about telomeres. These are the end caps on your chromosomes, and every time a cell divides,\n telomere gets a bit shorter. So it was thought that these telomeres are kind of like the tips of your shoelaces and they prevent the chromosome from fraying. But there are other signs in older bodies that you have old cells. There\n There are an accumulation of things that are called senescent cells. They're essentially these zombie-like cells that just go on living in your body and inflaming the cells around them. There's poor intercellular communication. There's mitochondrial dysfunction.\n the powerhouses of the cell. There are these eight or nine different features of older cells and they are the hallmarks of aging. But the question is, are they the cause of aging or are they kind of the result of a deeper\n root cause. In the middle of the last century, the hypothesis was that it was damage to our DNA, mutations to our DNA that happened over the course of our lives that led us to be older. But,\n Evidence since then has suggested that that is not really the case. You can take an adult cell and you can clone it into a new organism. And that organism appears to live about as long as\n as non-cloned organisms of the same species.\n And they're expected to live a normal lifespan. So in that way, it seems like all the information is still there in the DNA. So if we're not losing information in our DNA, then what is the reason for aging? Well, Professor Sinclair suspects\n that it's a loss of information, but not the information in our DNA, in our genome. No, Professor Sinclair suspects that the loss of information is in our epigenome. So what is the epigenome?\n Every cell in your body has the same DNA. But different cell types have different epigenomes. They have different ways of packaging that DNA, coiling up, you know, a lot of it so that it's not rich.\n and leaving some parts of the DNA spooled out so it's easier to transcribe and turn into proteins and run that cell. So the epigenome is responsible for turning on or turning off different parts of the DNA.\n The way it does that is with proteins called histones that essentially the DNA is wrapped on and also things like methylation, so there's these chemical signaling markers which are placed on the DNA in certain positions.\n So the idea is when your body is first forming, the epigenome is what tells your cells what type of cell to be. But as you get older, Professor Sinclair's hypothesis is that we are losing information in the epigenome.\n And that's important because if a skin cell needs to remain a skin cell, that's the epigenome. And if you don't have the epigenome, the skin cell will forget what type of cell it is, and it might turn into a brain cell, which may not be that bad, but if your brain turns into a skin cell,\n you've got a problem and I think that's largely what aging is. I've got to say like there's some weird like hair patches like on my shoulder that have happened as I've gotten older. Is that a cell like doing the wrong thing? Are those meant to be skin cells? Are they squashed?\n Is this just some screwing up or is this just some, I don't know? Weird stuff happens when you get older, right? You start to get hair growing where it shouldn't, ears, nose, back. That's cells losing their identity. Cells go, I can't remember what I'm supposed to do.\n reading the right genes anymore. So the key to this sort of breakdown of the epigenome is DNA damage? Yeah, so when you go out in the sun, and not like today, but on a day where there's a lot of sun, you'll break your\n to\n and reset the structures. And that resetting of the epigenome happens about 99%. That 1% is the aging process. So over time, histones are not returned to the right places\n and DNA methylation is added in places where it shouldn't be. We can read that methylation pattern and I could tell you how old you are exactly and when you're even gonna die. How could you tell\n that?\n than 40 of course, but you know I'm 50 now, but I might be biologically 60, actually I was, and I changed my life and then the test said I was biologically 31. I mean one of the things I found really interesting was you found a way to make mice\n age faster. So how'd you do that?\n enough to cause mutations, the cells put the DNA back together so we didn't lose any genetic information. But if we're right about the epigenetic information theory of aging, those mice should get old. And that's exactly what happened. It's gray, it's got a hunchback,\n it's got dementia, all its organs look old. But the real test was, what if we measured that DNA clock, what we call the DNA methylation clock, and we measured it and those mice were actually 50% older than mice that we didn't treat.\n So that isn't just a mouse that looks old, that mouse literally is older. What's interesting about this hypothesis is that if it's true, if the noise accumulating the epigenome is really what's causing aging, well then there are steps we can take\n right now to slow the rate of aging in our bodies by trying to better maintain our epigenomes. So how do we do that? There's this theory that billions of years ago, early bacteria\n The material took an important evolutionary step. They actually developed two different modes of living. When times were good, they used their energy to grow and reproduce. But when conditions were tough, they used their energy to protect\n and repair their cells. They evolved what Professor Sinclair calls, Longevity Genes. These genes, triggered by adversity, create enzymes which, among other things, maintain the epigenome. And today, those same Longevity Genes\n genes can be found in bacteria and us.\n our general defenses against aging. So what is that? So parts of our cells fall apart, they can put them back together. Proteins misfold, they can get rid of them or put them back together. The ends of the chromosomes get shorter, they can lengthen them. A lot of processes that go on.\n but one of the most important, I think, is maintaining the information, the epigenetic information in the cell, so that our cells don't forget what to do. There are three types of longevity gene. They're the ones we work on called sirtuins, and they control\n the information in the cell. In fact, SIR in the Sirtuin stands for Silent Information Regulator number two. There are other ones. The other group is called AMP kinase or AMPK. This group of genes senses how much energy we're taking in.\n mostly in the form of sugar. And then the third group is called mTOR and these genes control and respond to how much amino acids we're taking in. So if you eat a giant steak you've got a lot of amino acids coming into your body that'll\n actually prevent mTOR from hunkering down and keeping you being longer lived. So the mouse experiments actually bear this out. The best way to make a mouse live longer is to reduce the amount of time it eats, so periodic fasting,\n men fasting, to keep it a little bit cool and to restrict its amino acids. That's the recipe for long life for a mouse and it's true for monkeys as well. There have been calorie restricted studies where these monkeys for 15 years didn't eat as much food as\n the ones that gorged themselves whenever they wanted. And they were protected. They didn't just age slower. They didn't get as much diabetes and heart disease. They were actually fit and healthy when the control group, eating whatever they wanted, aged and became sick quicker. When some people think about eating\n eating less, like calorie restriction as a way to extend their life. That doesn't seem like a very pleasant way to extend life, I mean to be hungry for longer. So are there other ways to mimic that effect or to simulate\n There are these molecules that turn on the sirtuin pathway and trick the body. And so, for example, in the lab, if I give some of our mice a molecule called NMN, which raises the level of a chemical called\n called NAD. You get hyperactive defenses in the body. And what did you see in these senescent mice that you gave NMN to? Well, we had a bit of an incident. These mice that we gave NMN to ran 50% further,\n But actually some of them ran so far that the machine, the little treadmill, stopped working. And we had to reprogram the software because this program had never seen a mouse that ran more than three kilometers. Three kilometers for a mouse? For an old mouse. They outran the young mouse.\n young mice. And that's like an ultramarathon for us. That would be probably like taking a 70-year-old and making them run faster than a 20-year-old further. Yeah, so these are ultramarathoners. And if we did that to humans, imagine you could have 90-year-olds\n winning Olympic medals. So to sum up, there are six things that you can do right now to slow the rate of your aging. Starting with zero, avoid DNA damage. Wear sunscreen, avoid x-rays and all that sort of stuff.\n 1. Eat less. Caloric restriction. 2. Eat less protein. Because your body has ways of detecting how much of that you're taking in. 3. Do some exercise. High intensity interval training. Gets your heart rate up to 85%.\n Number four, be uncomfortably cold or number five, be uncomfortably hot. All of these things will trigger your body's longevity genes into\n maintaining your epigenome, going into repair and protect mode rather than grow and reproduce. And if you think about those things, those are generally all the things that we don't do. But what if slowing aging isn't enough for you?\n Well, this is where my interview with Professor Sinclair took an interesting turn, because he's actually done some research on reversing aging. So how would you do that? Well, effectively, you would need to take the epigenome and reset it back to an\n earlier time. But how is that possible? Back in 2012, a scientist named Yamanaka received the Nobel Prize for discovering four factors which, when applied in a gene therapy to an adult cell,\n reset the whole epigenome back to how that cell was when it was an embryo. So it is what is called a pluripotent stem cell. Now you wouldn't want to apply that to your entire body because well then you would turn into a giant\n tumor because your cells wouldn't know how to differentiate. But it does suggest that there are ways of resetting your epigenome and they could be the key to reversing aging. The big breakthrough that we just had in my lab only about a year or so\n ago was to reprogram the eye of a mouse. And the eye, we chose the eye because that's a very hard thing to fix, right? If you go blind when you're older, we think that's a one-way thing. You're never going to recover your vision. But we decided let's try\n try it anyway, let's go for broke. So we put a gene therapy in the eye of old mice, turned their retinas to be young again, reversed aging in their retinas, so those one year old mice went back to about two months, and guess what, those mice could\n see again, just like they were young again. How do you reset one of these eye cells without resetting it to just a stem cell? Well, we have to be very careful not to reset these cells to be basically a stem cell. Otherwise, we'd\n we wouldn't have mice that can see, we'd have mice with a giant tumor in the back of their eyes. So what we do is a couple of things. We didn't use all of the four reprogramming factors that won the Nobel Prize, we used just three. We leave off one called MEK, which causes cancer, and those three seem\n to be just the right recipe for taking the age of the eye backwards but not too far. Then the second thing we do is we turn it off. We can actually turn this system on when we want and off again so that we don't take them too far back in age.\n Can you do that with any cell? We think we can do this in any tissue. We've now given it to the whole mouse and those mice are fine. No evidence of cancer. They seem to be really quite healthy. So the big question is, can you take a mouse way back, the whole body?\n and be totally young again, maybe back from two years back to two months. And that's what we're doing right now. That's pretty exciting. It's freakishly exciting actually. I thought we'd just slow down aging. Now we're talking about an aging reset. You know what?\n We've only reset the age of the eye once. But how many times can we do this? Maybe it's twice, maybe it's a hundred times. So Professor Sinclair claims that his gene therapy reversed aging in the mouse's eye and allowed it to see again.\n But applying a gene therapy to every one of your trillion cells is pretty impossible. So in order for this to actually work and reset an entire body, you would need another way. And this is where\n the jellyfish come in. Because moon jellyfish, any cell in an adult jellyfish can actually be reset into an earlier stage of its life cycle. It can become a polyp again. So it seems like the jellyfish are actually\n capable of activating something like the Yamanaka factors and resetting their epigenomes to an earlier time in their lives. If we're able to figure out how they do that, well then maybe we could do the same with our own\n As we age most mammals, including humans,\n we lose stem cells over time and the stem cells we do have become more and more restricted over time into the types of cells they can make. So if we can understand how the moon jellyfish can take presumably many different kinds of cells and reverse engineer\n So, I still think we're a fair ways off from reversing aging in the entire human body. But what I found interesting from\n talking to Professor Sinclair was that there's at least a roadmap, at least a path ahead where you can see that it could be possible to slow and even reverse aging.\n Hey, this part of the video is sponsored by LastPass.

            "transcription": "For most of us, thinking is at least somewhat unpleasant. We try to avoid it where possible. For example, I ask these guys how long does it take for the earth to go around the sun? What do you reckon, Kaz? Is it 24 hours? Obviously a day, yes.\n problem which has been given to thousands of college students.\n the ball cost? If you think about it for just a second, it's obvious that the ball can't cost ten cents, because if it did, then the bat would cost a dollar ten and the two items together\n would cost $1.20. The correct answer is 5 cents. Now the point of these questions is not that they're difficult, any of these people could have quickly checked their answer if they wanted to, the point is that they don't check, because thinking is uncomfortable. It takes\n effort.\n put these mistakes down to stupidity and believe that you, being much smarter, could never fall into such traps. But then I think you'd be fooling yourself. I think these examples reveal blind spots in all of our thinking, due to the fundamental way that our brains work. Now one way of modeling\n the brain operates is as though there are two systems at work. Psychologists call them system one and system two, but maybe it's useful to think of them as characters. So let's call system one Gunn and system two Drew. You are Drew. He represents your\n I am who you think you are. Can I just use my calculator?\n No. Drew is lazy. It takes effort to get Drew to do anything, and he is slow, but he is the careful one, capable of catching and fixing mistakes. Now meets\n System 1, Gun. He is incredibly quick, which he needs to be since he's constantly processing copious amounts of information coming in through your senses. He picks out the relevant bits and discards the rest, which is most of it. And he works automatically, without you\n Drew being consciously aware of what he is doing. For example, when you spot some text, he reads it before you can even decide whether or not you want to read it. Gunn fills in the gaps. For example, what does this say? Did you notice that the H in the\n and the A and cat are actually the same symbol, but you had no trouble reading it because Gunn made the correct automatic assumption. So although Drew is unaware of what Gunn is doing, it's Gunn's perceptions that become the basis for your conscious thoughts. The way I like to think of it\n each of these characters is related to one of your main memory structures. Gunn's automatic responses are made possible by long-term memory, the library of experiences you've built up over your lifetime. In contrast, Drew exists entirely within working memory, so he's only\n capable of holding four or five novel things in mind at a time. This is perhaps one of the best known findings from psychology, that our capacity to hold and manipulate novel information is incredibly limited, like when trying to remember a string of random numbers.\n Yes! But we are able to overcome these limitations if the information is familiar to us. For example, let me give you four random digits.\n 1, 0, 2. These would normally take up most of your working memory capacity just to remember, but if you reverse them, 2017, they are now just one thing, the present year. The process of grouping things together according to your prior knowledge is called chunking, and you can actually\n hold four or five chunks in working memory at once. So the larger the chunks, the more information you can actively manipulate at one time. Learning is in the process of building more and bigger chunks by storing and further connecting information in long-term memory. Essentially, passing\n passing off tasks from Drew to Gunn. But in order for this to happen, Drew first has to engage with the information actively and effortfully, often multiple times. For example, when you were first learning to tie your shoelaces, you probably recited a rhyme to help you remember what to do next, using up\n all your working memory in the process. But after doing it over and over and over again, it gradually became automatic. That is, Drew doesn't have to think about it anymore because guns got it. Musicians and sports stars refer to this as muscle memory, though of course the memory is not in the muscles.\n it's still in the brain just controlled by gun.\n doing and what it feels like. Slow, deliberate, conscious practice repeated often enough leads to this.\n I bet 99% of the time what appears to be superhuman ability comes down to the incredible automation skills of Gunn developed through the painstaking deliberate practice of Drew. What's interesting is it's actually possible\n to see how hard Drew is working just by looking at someone. Try this task. I'm going to show you four digits. I want you to read them out loud and then after two beats I want you to say each number back on the beat but adding one to each digit. So as an example, 7291...\n should be 8 3 0 2 This is called the add one task and it forces drew to hold these digits in memory while making manipulations to them Now it's important to say the numbers back on the beat try this one\n To make it harder, you can try adding three instead of one. Ready?\n Now what you're unaware of is that as you're completing this task your pupils are dilating. When Drew is hard at work as he is in this task, you have a physiological response including increased heart rate, sweat production and pupil dilation.\n Watch how the pupils of these participants enlarge as they perform the add one and add three tasks.\n Excellent, nicely done. That's the point. Six nine one six seven zero two\n When this research was originally carried out, the researchers made a surprising observation. When the participants were not engaged with the task but were just chatting with the experimenters, their pupils didn't really dilate at all. This indicates that the ADD1 and ADD3\n tasks are particularly strenuous for system two, and that most of our day to day life is a stroll for Drew, with most tasks handled automatically by gun. Just as we spend a lot of our lives lounging around, our brains spend most of their time doing the mental equivalent. And I don't\n mean to make that sound like a bad thing. This is how our brains evolved to make the best use of resources. For repetitive tasks, we developed automatic ways of doing things, reserving Drew's limited capacity for things that really need our attention. But in some circumstances, there can be mix-ups.\n For example, I moved to Australia in 2004 and one of the first things I learned was that to turn the lights on, you flick the switch down. My whole life growing up in Canada, Gunn had automated that up means on, so no matter how well I drew, knew that down was on\n in Australia, I would for years continually switch the lights off when entering a room and on when leaving. When Destin learned to ride the backwards bicycle with its steering reversed, it took months to overcome his automated habit. And once he had done that, he couldn't easily go back to riding a normal bike.\n understanding Gunn and Drew also explains errors in the bat and ball question it's Gunn who first perceives the key pieces of information that together the bat and ball cost a dollar ten the bat cost a dollar more than the ball so the ball costs ten cents ten cents Gunn immediately\n So how do you get Drew to do more work? Well, researchers have found\n at least one way. When they gave out a clearly printed test including the bat and ball question to incoming college students, 85% got at least one wrong. But when they printed the test in a hard to read font, with poor contrast, the error rate dropped to 35%. A harder to read test\n resulted in more correct answers. The explanation for this is simple, since Gunn can't quickly jump to an answer, he hands off the task to Drew, who then invests the required mental effort to reason his way to the correct answer. When something is confusing, Drew works harder, and when Drew works harder\n you're more likely to reach the right answer and remember the experience. This is something I think the advertising industry knows about and is using to its advantage. A few years ago, again in Australia, I saw a giant billboard that had just two letters on it. Un. There was no logo\n no indication of what it was for, and this seems to go against all the basic principles of advertising, to show what the product does, how it's better than the competition, and use clear branding and maybe a jingle to make it memorable. The goal is usually to make the message as easy to understand as possible, so Drew\n doesn't have to work very hard. But if you look at a lot of effective advertising today, it's changed to be more confusing. As the Un campaign rolled out across Sydney, I saw ads like this one in bus shelters. Un-explained. With Un, there is no stress, just unstress.\n stress. No hassle, just unhassle. With un, you can undo what you did. You can un-drive through the car wash with the window down. Or un-breakdance in front of your teenage son and his mates. Un makes life relaxing and unreal. Un your life. Be happy and live for now. Don't worry, un-worry.\n worry. Can you guess what the ads were for? They're actually for insurance. Now that advertising is everywhere, Gunn is skilled at filtering it out. It's automatic. If I just saw another insurance ad, I never would have given it a second thought. But something that doesn't make sense? That's something Gunn\n can't deal with, so he hands it off to Drew. This same realization has been happening in education. Lectures, which have long been the dominant teaching method, are now on the decline. Like the old form of advertising, they're too easy to tune out. And often, especially in science lectures, too many new\n pieces of information are presented, and that exceeds Drew's capacity because he doesn't have big enough chunks to break the material into. In place of lectures, universities are introducing workshops, peer instruction, and formats where students are forced to answer more questions, do more work than just listen and take\n notes. And this will undoubtedly make Drew work harder. Which is good, because that's how learning happens. But a lot of students don't like it because it requires more effort. Just as it's hard to motivate someone to get off the couch and exercise, it's hard to get Drew to give his full effort.\n There's an appeal to doing things you already know. For the musician to play the same familiar songs that Gunn has already automated that feel and sound good. To watch videos that give you the sensation of understanding without actually learning anything. To always drive with the Jeep\n on so you never get lost but you also never learn the way. If you really want to learn and get better at anything, have any chance of becoming an expert, you have to be willing to be uncomfortable because thinking takes effort. It involves fighting through confusions\n fusion, and for most of us, that's at least somewhat unpleasant.\n you"

            "transcription": "How do you fix a brain that's not working properly? Well, until now, the only real option has been to open up the skull, implant electrical or optical fibers, or even remove parts of the brain. If you do something like surgery or\n But this scientist has a different idea.\n Professor of Chemical Engineering at Caltech. Everything that we try to do is to make it non-invasive, meaning that we don't want to have any kind of surgery to open up the skull and implant an electrode, or we don't want to have to open up the skull to shine light.\n onto the neurons, we want to do it using Soundwave, which is one of the few forms of energy that can be focused deep inside of the tissue and can actually permeate through things like the skull, even the human skull. This is a curved transducer, so you can see there's\n For now, the research is being conducted on mice, and the idea is to be able to turn on\n and off specific brain reg invasive surgery. So the here is that we take somet been a really big probl drugs and we turn it int\n advantage. So the problem has what's called the blo which lines the blood ves and prevents molecules in the bloodstream into the procedure, they open th\n in carefully targeted regions of the brain.\n Okay, tiny air bubbles.\n tract in size and as they're doing that they push against the blood vessel walls and kind of massage them open. So they get that blood brain barrier that's normally caused by really tight junctions between cells to open just a crack.\n Once the blood-brain barrier is open, the scientists\n inject a specially made virus that would normally not be able to pass into the brain.\n What this gene produces are these receptors that will go onto the neuron. These receptors have been modified so they no longer respond to neurotransmitters that are natively present inside the brain and will instead respond to a drug that we can inject\n that will activate just those receptors and not act on anything else. I'll tell you when we get to a part where your camera's gonna get sucked into the magnet before it happens. Thank you. I appreciate that.\n So this big machine here is what generates the sound waves that we use. This little device will get installed on here and then we're going to have a mouse underneath and then this entire thing\n is going to go into the MRI scanner. Is this a special ultrasound for mice? Both the MRI is special for mice because as you can see from the boar that's in the middle of it, it's not going to fit a human.\n Yeah, it would have to be a really small human. And then our ultrasound system also is designed for these kind of small animals. And that squeaking sound that I'm hearing, that's not actually mice in there. That's MRI? Yeah. How strong is the magnetism?\n inside the scanner it's 7 Tesla. So it's going to give us an image of the anatomy of the brain and allow us to target the focus of this ultrasound transducer to precisely the part of the brain where\n we want to open the blood-brain barrier. There will be four bright spots that will appear on the brain, just about here. So this is the opening of the barrier between the blood and the brain that allows a diffusion of what is essentially a magnetic resonance imaging done\n that shows up during the MRI imaging. This is the hippocampus. Hippocampus is a fairly large structure that's important in the formation of memory and this is the one that we targeted in our recent study to modulate the memory of mice. We targeted the hippocampus\n campus, which is this part of the brain that's necessary for the formation of certain kinds of memories. And using our technique, we can address just the neurons within the hippocampus, and when we give a drug, those neurons get shut down. And then we can do behavioral experiments.\n where we did a memory task where we put the mice into a particular environment and checked the next day by bringing the mice back into that same environment whether or not they could remember it. And for the mice that were treated with the ultrasound,\n with the receptors through the viral vectors and given the drug that activates these receptors that shut down the hippocampus, those mice were not able to remember. So we could tell that we were successfully able to inhibit or prevent memory\n Because the effect depends on when you give this drug and how much of the drug you give, you can have reversible turning on or off of the effect that you're trying to produce. So for example shutting down the part of the\n brain that's causing a seizure. So another part of the brain that we're pretty interested in is called the ventral tegmental area, which is a part of the brain that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine and is involved in things like motivation and addiction\n and initiation and control of movement. And if we can gain control of the neurons in that area, it might someday be useful for treatments for some of these motivational or affective disorders like\n addiction or depression. Could you use this to control people's brains like by playing ultrasound into some area? No, no. There is not a chance, at least using our technology, that you could be walking around and we could be controlling your brain remotely. If that's what you're worried about.\n Not yet, anyway. That is not our goal.\n classes in a wide range of subjects, everything from video production and animation to business, marketing, entrepreneurship, and more. The idea is they get actual experts working in their fields to teach these classes. For example, they have a class on animation by Kersgesatt, and I personally\n personally found that class really informative and helpful. I mean, who wouldn't want to animate like Kyrgyzgoss at? In fact, in making the animations for this video, I worked closely with a professional editor and animator and I was better able to do that thanks to taking this class.

            "transcription": "10,000 years ago, the average human life lasted just over 30 years. And then 100 years ago, that number was up to 50. And if you were born in a\n few decades in the developed world, then your life expectancy is 80 years. But that is of course assuming that no major breakthroughs happen during your lifetime that can slow the process of aging. And that may be a very bad assumption.\n There's a new series on National Geographic Channel which was developed with GE and the show's creators wanted to present my take on aging. So I'm here at the GE Global Research Center to talk to principal scientist Dr. Fiona Ginty.\n And this would be kind of an example of, you know, one of the types of images we would generate. So what are we looking at here? So these are our cells that are actively dividing. And these are cells that are heading on their way to death or apoptosis.\n Aging is not recognized as a disease. I mean there are plenty of diseases we do acknowledge like diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, and at their core aging may be responsible for all of them. And yet aging seems to\n natural because it's something that we do from birth and for a while it makes us better bigger stronger faster more intelligent but then at some point in your life it reverses and aging makes our bodies decay and degrade\n Why is that? Why do we have to age? Why do our bodies have to decay? Well, scientists are now realizing there is a fundamental cellular mechanism at the heart of aging. Do we age at the macroscopic level because\n Key discovery was made by a biologist named Hayflick. He was studying normal human cells.\n And what he found was they can only divide a finite number of times. On average, it's about 50. Beyond that, the cell becomes senescent, which means it's an aged cell. It can divide no longer.\n lives for a little while, but it's the accumulation of these senescent cells in our bodies that leads to aging on the macroscopic scale. So it's as though cells have this little timer inside them that tells them when to stop dividing.\n But how do they know and what is that timer? So telomeres are like the, so like your shoelaces have you know a little bit of plastic at the end to stop them from fraying. So telomeres are like\n the ends of your shoe laces. But for chromosomes. But for chromosomes. So they stop the chromosomes, they keep the chromosomes together and they stop it sticking to other chromosomes. So every time a cell divides, it loses some of the telomere. They estimate about 200\n Why is that? Why can't it just copy to the end? You know, it's just sort of really the mechanics of it. You know, there's only so much space when they DNA polymerase does its job of replicating. So the telomere, and the telomere getting shorter is like your molecular\n the cellular clock inside each cell that tells it how many times it has divided.\n What if there was a way to stop the telomeres from shortening? If we could do that, maybe the cells would live\n forever.\n is the lobster. It just gets bigger over time. It doesn't get weaker and its chromosomes don't change. It has long telomeres that do not shorten. So it only dies when it gets eaten by something else, like us.\n So how could we be more like a lobster? Some people would say maybe I want my telomerase to be higher for longer. Mm-hmm. Would that help? I mean would that keep us younger? I mean it's balanced because you know in cancer you've got\n perfect example of telomerase being active and it becomes an unregulated growth situation. This is the double-edged sword of telomeres and telomerase. Cancer cells have really long telomeres\n And they can divide indefinitely. And that is the problem with cancer. Cancer is dividing cells that won't stop and they won't die. So in a way, cancer is a way of dividing cells.\n is the immortal cell living within us. So maybe we've developed the aging process. Maybe we have telomeres that shorten for a very good reason. Because otherwise they could become cancerous.\n The theories there is that the cells divide that limited number of times because it stops them from accumulating damage that may be detrimental. It might cause them to become cancer. Exactly.\n developments in medicine have increased human lifespan more than we could have imagined. And I can only expect that the next hundred years will bring similarly incredible results. I'm not sure where or how they will take place, but you can bet.\n that your life expectancy today will not be the actual age at which you die.\n by Ron Howard. That's airing on Sunday, November 29th at 9, 8 Central. That is just one of six episodes of Breakthrough, which was developed by National Geographic Channel and GE.

            "transcription": "I am a sun sneezer, which is also known as having the photic sneeze reflex, or the autosomal dominant compelling helioophthalmic outburst syndrome. Which basically means if I go from a dark area into somewhere that's brightly lit,\n You know, like looking at the sun, I will sneeze. Wait for it.\n There you go. I'm a sun-sneezer. But why does this happen?\n People have known about this effect for at least a few thousand years. Aristotle was probably a sun-sneezer because in his book of problems he asked why does the sun provoke sneezing? And his answer was it was the heat from the sun which causes\n sweating inside your nose, and so you sneeze to get rid of the moisture. But a couple millennia later, Sir Francis Bacon demonstrated that this could not be the case, because when he closed his eyes and turned towards\n the sun, well he did not experience that photic sneeze reflex. So his explanation was that it was the eyes watering and then when some of that moisture got down into the nose that caused the tickle which makes you sneeze. But even this theory has its problems because\n Eye-watering is a much slower process than the photic sneeze reflex, so it can't be the cause. Before I started researching sun sneezing, I thought that having the photic sneeze reflex must convey some sort of evolutionary advantage onto the people who have it.\n If you think about it, sneezing is a way of transmitting disease. In your snot, there can be the living bacteria that cause tuberculosis and strep throat, or viruses that cause measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza. So if you're living in a moist, dark\n cave and you sneeze, or your snot lands on the floor or the walls of the cave and those pathogens can stay alive for hours or even days, increasing the likelihood of spreading that disease to other people who live with you in your cave. Whereas, if you only\n sneeze when you emerge from the darkness of the cave and into bright sunlight? Well then, that mucus will quickly dry out, or because it's exposed to the harmful UV rays of the sun, it will kill all of those pathogens, greatly decreasing\n the risk of spread of disease. By the 1960s, some studies were revealing the hereditary nature of the photic sneeze reflex. There was a father who would sneeze two times when he entered bright sunlight, and when they\n tested his baby daughter, who was just four weeks old, moving her from a dark room into full sunlight also caused her to sneeze exactly two times. And by the 1980s, it was clear that this trait was autosomal dominant, meaning that you only needed to inherit\n one copy of the gene from just one of your parents in order to exhibit the trait. But when studies of the population have been done, only about 18 to 35 percent of people actually have the photic sneeze reflex. So I don't really think this\n gives a great evolutionary advantage, otherwise everyone would have it. You know, it could just be one of those random mutations that happens over time and sustains itself because it's neither good nor bad, evolutionarily speaking. So to\n It affects roughly one in four people. Can you spot the person with the photic sneeze reflex? Nowadays it's actually been found that the gene responsible for the photic sneeze reflex is on the second chromosome and it's a single letter of DNA.\n that's been changed. On my second chromosome, I have a C where non-sun-sneezers have a T. And the reason that we know this is that back in 2010, there was a study of about 10,000 people where they went online and they reported whether they were sun-sneezers or not.\n and then their DNA was analyzed and the groups were compared and what they found was the thing the Sun Sneezers had in common was this one particular letter change in their DNA. That, I think, is pretty amazing.\n Now, it's unclear exactly how this change affects your physiology and makes you more susceptible to sun sneezes, but the best theory at the moment is that it involves the trigeminal nerve, which is the largest cranial nerve. It involves all of the feeling that you have in your face.\n and as the name implies it actually has three branches, one of which receives stimuli from your eye and another which receives stimuli from your nose. So the thought is that this really active stimulation of the optic nerve may cross over into the maxillary branch.\n causing that little tickle which gets you to sneeze. Photic sneezes are generally pretty harmless unless you're doing something like flying a fighter jet or performing some sort of delicate surgery. But this methodology can allow us to learn a lot about different hair\n This episode of Veritasium was supported by 23andMe, which is actually the company that figured out\n that gene polymorphism responsible for the photic sneeze reflex. The name of the company 23andMe comes from the fact that humans actually have 23 pairs of chromosomes and the purpose of the company is to give people insight into their own DNA.\n So what you do is spit into a vial, which is actually much harder than it sounds, and send it off to them. And of course, in your saliva are some of the cells from your mouth. They analyze the DNA from those cells, and then they send you a report where you can find out tons of stuff\n about your genes like where do your genes come from that is what's your ancestry and do you have the photic sneeze reflex do we share the same change of DNA on our second chromosome you can also learn about your health and other\n physical traits and how much Neanderthal you are. So if you want to learn more about your genotype then you should go to 23andme.com slash Veritasium. So I want to thank 23andme for supporting me and I want to thank you for watching.\n you"

But how is this possible just using ordinary food coloring and water?\n Well the key is evaporation. Each drop is constantly evaporating, so around it is an envelope of vapor. The rate of evaporation depends on the humidity around the drop, so the drier the air is, the faster the rate of evaporation. So when any two drops are close\n enough the humidity between them is greater than the humidity around them and therefore there's more evaporation around the droplets than in between them and this pushes them together. So differential evaporation makes the droplets attract but that's not the whole story.\n Food coloring is a mixture of mainly two molecules water and propylene glycol these two liquids mix well So we say they are missable, but they have different properties for example water evaporates more readily because it's lighter and it has a\n stronger surface tension due to hydrogen bonding. And this is important because interesting things happen when there are gradients in surface tension. For example, if I add some pepper to this bowl of water to allow me to see the motion, and then I add\n little dab of soap right in the middle you see that all of the water rushes outwards and this is because soap has a lower surface tension than water. You can think of it a bit like a tug-of-war. Before I added the soap all of those\n water molecules were pulling on each other equally. But once I add the soap molecules in the middle, their weaker surface tension means the water molecules around them are pulling harder on each other than the soap is, and so they rush outwards away from that spreading soap drop.\n And this motion is called Marangoni flow. And a similar thing is actually happening with our food coloring droplets. If you have drops of similar concentration, they attract each other due to the higher humidity in between them and they merge. And although drops of different concentration\n also attract each other, they don't merge when they come into contact. This is because the water in the lower concentration drop pulls together and away from the drop of the higher concentration of propylene glycol, just like with the soap and water, and differential evaporation drives the two drops forward.\n It is fascinating to watch these droplets and think about how closely their motion mimics life. Living organisms seek out molecules like food, and this is a process known as chemotaxis. But what these droplets are doing is really\n not all that dissimilar. In fact, it's been called artificial chemotaxis. And as amazingly lifelike as their motion appears, in a way I think it shouldn't be all that surprising. After all, evolution began with the natural\n natural tendencies of molecules to form and break apart, to attract and repel, and then over billions of years of refinement through natural selection, evolution has produced bodies whose utilization of these natural tendencies of molecules appears\n miraculous. And it's that that we call life. I tried using slides that hadn't been passed through a flame and then I couldn't get the drops to move. So on researching\n this further, I found out that passing the microscope slide through the flame creates a high energy surface. What that means is the flame is essentially breaking open some of the bonds, the glass bonds in the surface of this slide. And when you\n put the droplet on top, it's those open bonds, it's that high energy surface that draws some of the water molecules away from the droplet. And that actually makes the water molecule more likely to evaporate. But as just happened right there, some of the microscopes\n Some of the microscope slides have shattered, and so you should be particularly careful when doing this procedure. Obviously heating them up to a very high temperature causes them to expand a lot, and when they contract again as they're cooling, well then they sometimes break\n apart because of those stresses."

            "transcription": "Do cell phones cause brain cancer?\n Now it doesn't seem to make sense that cell phones should cause cancer because the radiation they emit is non-ionizing, which means it doesn't have enough energy to rip electrons off atoms or molecules and destroy DNA.\n So how would cell phones cause this type of cancer in the... I don't know man, that's black magic to me. The radiation from cell phones is almost identical to the radiation inside a microwave. The wavelengths\n are almost the same, about 15 centimeters long, basically the same size as your phone.\n This led to various internet videos where cell phones were shown popping popcorn or cooking eggs. Now that is obviously impossible because the amount of power in a microwave is over a thousand\n times the power of radiation of microwaves emitted from your cell phone. But the truth is this, if you live in an area\n with better reception that means your phone has to emit less microwaves in order to transmit to the tower so you're actually exposed to lower levels of microwave radiation living near a tower than living far from it. However there have been some signs\n scientific studies that show very high level microwaves like those from a mobile phone can cause heat shock proteins to be released inside the body and it's thought that that could be related to the onset of cancer. So perhaps there is a\n a reason to study the biological effects of cell phones on people.\n two to three times is just massive. I know it's a slim odd, but still the chances are like you don't want that to happen to anyone, let alone yourself. So definitely not use it as much. What if I told you that a study has come out that says over long periods of time, there's\n a three-fold increase in brain tumors. A recently published Swedish study found that cell phone users were 30% more likely to develop glioma. That's the most common form of malignant brain cancer. And it gets worse, those people who had used a cell phone for over 25 years\n had a three-fold increase in this type of cancer. Due to studies like that one and expert opinion, the World Health Organization actually classified cell phone radiation as possibly carcinogenic to humans. But now consider that brain cancers are exceedingly\n Now according to the Swedish study, long-term cell phone use can increase that risk up to 9 in 100,000. Still a very small risk, but a significant one.\n significant increase. Now, given the scarcity of brain cancers, how can they really quantify this risk? The ideal way to do the experiment would be to perform a randomized control trial, which is where you get a group of people who don't use cell phones\n randomly give half of them cell phones and force the other half to live without. Then follow them for 15 to 20 years and see how many in each group develop glioma. Oh, and you would need hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people to take part because of just how\n rare brain tumors are.\n to a cell phone than to a working toilet. So the next best way to do the experiment would be to perform a prospective observational study in which you gather a group of people and follow them over a period of decades monitoring their\n cell phone use. And then you find out how many develop glioma and correlate that with their cell phone usage. The problem is people who use their cell phones a lot may differ in other ways than just their cell phone use. Plus there's the problem of scale. Even if you followed around\n 50,000 people for 10 years you'd only expect to observe 20 gliomas and that's not nearly enough to detect a difference between the groups. So the third way to do the experiment is to perform a case control study where you collect a group of\n people who have brain tumors, those are the cases, and you find a demographically very similar group who don't have brain tumors, those are the controls. And then you ask them about their behaviors over the previous decade and see if they differ markedly between\n the groups. For example, did the brain tumor cases use their phones a lot more than the controls? The Swedish study was one of these large-scale case control studies. But there is a question about whether this study was methodologically flawed. In hindsight, if you get\n Now there have been a few prospective studies completed, including one in Denmark, using almost the entire Danish population and records from their cell phone\n companies and they found no link between cell phone usage and incidents of brain cancer. Another prospective study using almost 1 million women in the UK again found no link. So what are we supposed to believe then? What are we supposed to believe? This is where\n I think we really need to figure out the right methodology to look at it. And here's the thing, right? Over the last 15 to 20 years almost everyone has used a mobile phone. Mobile phone use has gone way up. Everyone's got one. So you can look at the actual brain cancer rates on the\n If the results of the Swedish study were correct, then the rates of glioma would be more than\n 40% higher than they are. So it is extremely unlikely that cell phones actually cause brain cancer. And if they do, either the effects take decades to show or the increase in risk is very, very small.\n Hello?\n and titles in all areas of literature including fiction, nonfiction and periodicals. Now this week I wanted to recommend a book which had an impact on my life. It is called The E-Myth by Michael E. Gerber. It's a business book about why a lot of small businesses fail.\n because they have this myth at their core. The E-Myth is the entrepreneurial myth that if you know how to do something, for example make videos, then you know how to make a business that does that thing. For example, make a video production business.\n That is just not the case. And I think the way that Michael Gerber approaches this subject from the myth forward, you know, very much emulates what I did with my PhD thesis and what I do now on YouTube in the way I teach, and I found it also a very effective way to learn\n about making my own business. So if you are thinking about starting your own business then I would highly highly recommend this book and in fact you can download it for free by going to audible.com slash Veritasium or you can pick any other book of your choosing for a one month free trial.

It was in a spearfishing championship.\n that I was the reigning champion. It was a six hour competition. After four hours, many fish had been speared and each one had bled into the water. The tide had gone out but nobody had seen any sharks.\n And I went out a bit wider and deeper to try and find fish that hadn't been scared. And as I dived down I was just about to spear a fish when this huge thump and crash hit me in the chest.\n knocked the gun out of my hand, the mask off my face, I was hurled through the water, then I realised it had to be a shark and I thought what can I do to protect myself so I gouged the shark's\n or with my fingers trying to get its eyes. It seemed to let go and as I fell away I pushed at that shark to try and push it away but my hand went right in his mouth ripping. I ended up with only one tendon left.\n and 94 stitches in my hand. But I grabbed the shark around the belly and still 30, 40 feet underwater holding on. And then I realized I needed air because I was snorkeling and I was going to drown.\n I pushed up to the surface and on the surface I yelled out, shark, shark, and I looked down and the shark was coming back to attack again.\n I could see this great big head and white teeth coming up through the blood red water and I thought I got nothing at all to protect myself. I kicked at the shark, but the miracle\n happened the shark turned and swallowed the float that I had attached two or three fish to. It dived and as it dived it dragged me underwater and I'm on the rope and as it dragged down\n And I tried to find my belt to get rid of it, but I couldn't find it, I couldn't find the catch. And I hadn't breathed, deep breathed much, and I was just about to gasp, water and drown when another miracle happened. The line.\n broke. It was severed when the shark bit me around the chest and it managed to break. As I came up to the surface yelling out shark, shark, shark, a boat actually had seen the bright red water, my blood\n and was coming over to investigate. They quickly picked me up, rolled me into the boat and with really great precision I was in the hospital within an hour, given blood and luckily\n did stop. The photographs that were taken on the operating table and my stories went around the world. People wondered whether I'd go back in the water. It was when I was at the Adelaide Zoo looking at the lion\n I'll make a cage, I'll lower it over the side of the boat in an area where these great big great white sharks have it and I'll have a look for myself to see if I want to go diving again because I love diving.\n up diving but I was really scared. We made the first cage and on that first expedition about 48 years ago we made the first Great White Shark films ever. That first time that you put the cage in the water?\n Did that cure your fear? Not really at all. It helped. The first shark that came really looked like a small submarine with a deadly front on it, like torpedoes with teeth.\n We thought maybe the sharks were interested in the people inside, but then we found that they would come up and bite on the cage, even when there was no one in it. And what we ended up finding was the electrolysis that was set out by the salt water on the cage.\n steel that attracted them. So now that you've spent so much time with sharks, how do you feel about them? They're a wonderful, interesting animal, and even today they still need help because people still fear\n and dread them because they're the last major predator that will eat you. But with education I think people will understand that we need them in our oceans and 400 varieties, there's only a handful that\n may bite people. The more I got interested in sharks and the more I loved the sea, I was able to return and go abalone diving all the way along our coastline.\n I spent 16 years and 5,000 hours or more underwater and on those occasions I only saw three sharks. Normally they don't have humans on their menu list. They prefer to stick to their own.\n food. Thank goodness they didn't because along our beaches they'd be a real smorgasbord if they wanted to. A lot of people would say you've got reason more than most to hate sharks and yet you don't.\n Can you explain it? It's the anomaly of this fear that was generated and shown to me after my shark attack made me think. Going back into the water,\n was a real relief and I found it wasn't as bad as everybody thought. So I spent all my life trying to put sharks in a different perspective. Because of that experience you had? Because of my experience, yeah.\n you\n you"

But luckily, you know something about nanotechnology.\n You know, really, really tiny devices and materials that are less than 100 nanometers in size. Of course, I don't have to tell you, a nanometer is a billionth of a meter.\n That's roughly the size of 10 atoms. But how do you create something that tiny? It's time to embrace your inner MacGyver. You're going to need a pencil, some scotch tape, and a healthy dose of elbow grease.\n A pencil contains not lead, but graphite, which consists of sheets of carbon in a hexagonal lattice. When you write, layers of graphite slide off the tip of the pencil and stick to the paper. Usually many\n layers are stacked on top of each other, but once in a while you get a single layer of carbon atoms, and this is called graphene. In 2004, Andre Game and Constance\n 17 Nova Selov created graphene using nothing but graphite and scotch tape. They placed a graphite flake onto the tape, folded it in two, and then cleaved the flake in half. They repeated this procedure a number of times,\n and then study the resulting fragments.

This was particularly unexpected because it was thought a single layer of graphite would not be chemically stable, especially at room temperature.\n Graphene conducts electrons faster than any other substance at room temperature. This is because of the extraordinarily high quality of the graphene lattice. Scientists are yet to find a single atom out of place\n in graphene.

Graphene is incredibly strong if you could balance an elephant on a pencil and support\n If you could port the pencil on graphene, the graphene wouldn't break. Of course, the pencil would. For their discovery, Game and Novoselov were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010.\n This is only the beginning for graphene. Scientists are hard at work exploiting its unique properties to create thin, transparent, flexible touchscreens, smaller, faster, more energy-efficient computers.\n tough composite materials, and more efficient solar cells.

            "transcription": "This will revolutionize education. No prediction has been made as often or as incorrectly as that one. In 1922, it was Thomas Edison who declared that the motion picture is destined\n to revolutionize our educational system, and that in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely, the use of textbooks. Yeah, and you know how that worked out? By the 1930s, it was radio. The idea was you could beam experts directly into\n improving the quality of education for more students at lower cost and that would mean you require fewer skilled teachers, a theme common to all of the proposed education revolutions like that of educational television in the 1950s and 60s.\n Studies were conducted to determine whether students preferred watching a lecture live or sitting in an adjacent room where the same lecture was broadcast via closed-circuit TV. What would you prefer? In the 80s, there was no debating.\n computers were the revolutionary solution to our educational woes. They were audio-visual, interactive, and could be programmed to do almost anything you like. Well, at the time they could run Oregon Trail, but their potential was obvious. Researchers suspected that\n if they could teach kids to program, say, how to move a turtle around a screen, then their procedural reasoning skills would also improve. So how did it go? Well, the students got better at programming the turtle, but their reasoning skills were unaffected.\n Even by the 1990s we had not learned from the failure of our past predictions. And I quote, Video discs?\n Yeah, those giant oversized CD things. Remember when they revolutionized education? Nowadays, plenty of things are poised to revolutionize education, like smart boards, smartphones, tablets, and MOOCs. Those are massive open\n online courses. And some believe we're getting close to a universal teaching machine. A computer so quick and well programmed that it's basically like having your own personal tutor in a machine. A student could work through well-structured lessons at their own pace, receiving immediate\n and personally tailored feedback and all without the interference of a meddlesome and expensive teacher. Do these claims sound familiar? Over the past 100 years, a lot of areas of life have been revolutionized, but education is not one of them.\n By and large, students are still taught in groups by a single teacher. And that is not what a revolution looks like. Some might blame this state of affairs on the inertia of our educational institutions. It's just too hard to get a huge bureaucracy\n to change, but I think the reason technology hasn't revolutionized education is something else. Something that goes to the very heart of what education is. Let's consider the process of learning. Say you want to teach someone how a human heart pumps blood. Which learning\n do you think would be more effective? This animation with narration or this set of static pictures with text? Obviously the animation is better. I mean for one thing it shows exactly what the heart does. For decades educational research\n focused on questions like this. Does a video promote learning better than a book? Are live lectures more effective than televised lectures? Is animation better than static graphics? In all well-controlled studies, the result is no significant difference.\n That is, so long as the content is equivalent between the two treatments, the learning outcomes are the same with all different media. How is this possible? How can something which seems so powerful, like animation, be no more effective than static graphics?\n Well, for one thing, animations are fleeting and so you might miss something as they go by. Plus, since the parts are animated for you, you don't have to mentally envision how the parts are moving. And so, you don't have to invest as much mental effort, which would make it more mental.\n memorable. In fact, sometimes static graphics perform better than animations. And I think this points to a really fundamental aspect of education, which is it doesn't matter what happens around the learner. We are not limited by the experiences we can\n give to students. What limits learning is what can happen inside the student's head. That is where the important part of learning takes place. No technology is inherently superior to any other.\n researchers spent so much time investigating whether one medium or technology was more effective than another that they failed to investigate exactly how to use the technology to promote meaningful thought processes so the question really is what experiences\n promote the kind of thinking that is required for learning. Recently that research is being conducted and we're finding out some pretty important stuff. I mean it may sound obvious but it turns out learning with words and pictures together whether they're animation and narration\n For example, on-screen text competes with visuals, so learners perform better when it is\n Now that we know how best to make educational videos and any experience can be simulated in the video setting, YouTube must be the platform that will revolutionize education. I mean the number of educational videos on YouTube\n is increasing every day. So why do we need teachers? Well, if you think that the fundamental job of a teacher is to transmit information from their head to their students, then you're right. They are obsolete. I mean, you probably\n Imagine a classroom where this teacher is spewing out facts at a pace which is appropriate for one student too fast for half and too slow for the rest Luckily the fundamental role of a teacher is not to deliver information. It is to guide the social process of learning\n The job of a teacher is to inspire, to challenge, to excite their students to want to learn. Yes, they also do explain and demonstrate and show things, but fundamentally that is beside the point.\n the most important thing a teacher does is make every student feel like they are important. To make them feel accountable for doing the work of learning. All of this is not to say technology has had no impact on education. Students and teachers work\n and communicate via computers. And videos are used both inside and outside of classrooms. But all of this is best characterized as an evolution, not a revolution. The foundation of education is still based on the social interaction between\n teachers and students. For as transformative as each new technology seems to be, like motion pictures or computers or smart boards, what really matters is what happens inside the learner's head. And making a learner think seems best\n achieved in a social environment with other learners and a caring teacher.\n you"

            "transcription": "This is a robot that can grow to hundreds of times its size, and it can't be stopped by adhesives or spikes. Although it looks kind of simple and cheap, it has dozens of potential applications, including one day,\n maybe saving your life. This video is sponsored by Morning Brew, the free daily newsletter. Now I made a video before about a soft truss robot, and this is also a soft robot, but\n very different in how it works and what it can do. These robots can be made out of almost any material, but they all follow the same basic principle. Powered by compressed air, they grow from the tip. That's good.\n And this allows the robot to pass through tight spaces and also over sticky surfaces. Something like a car would get stuck to it. It gets stuck in the\n It can navigate this curvy and twisted passageway effortlessly, which suggests some of the applications it's well suited for. You might think spikes would be the downfall\n of an inflatable robot, but even if it's punctured, as long as you have sufficient air pressure, the robot keeps going. And you might be able to hear it. It's actually leaking now. So I'll have to turn up the pressure.\n This by itself is not yet a robot, but once we had steering, a camera, some sensors, and maybe some intelligence as to where we're directing it, then we could say it's a robot. So this is sort of the backbone of a robot. This is what allows us to build our type of robots.\n So where did the idea for this device come from?\n The solution is really elegant in its simplicity. Just take some airtight tubing and fold it in\n on itself. It's kind of like a water wiggly, those toys that are really hard to hold. When you inflate it with compressed air, it starts growing out from the tip, and if you want the tube to always bend at a certain spot, you could just tape\n the tubing on the outside to shorten one of the sides. For example, you could tape it into a helical shape to create a deployable antenna.\n All you really have to do is pull on, we call it the tail, so the material that is passing through the core of the body. You pull on it and it basically ungrows. It just goes back inside itself. Now if you're in a big open area like this and you try pulling on that,\n Instead of inverting, so retracting, it tends to kind of coil up and make an ugly shape. And the engineers have come up with ways to retract the tube to prevent it from buckling using internal rollers. But the tube doesn't\n have to be the same diameter the whole way along. Here there's actually a much wider section, think of it like a pillow that's packed into the end of the robot. Yeah, if you could sit cross-legged on it. Cross-legged on the table. This sounds super sketchy.\n So it grows underneath the table, just as usual, and then as the pillow part starts inflating, it can actually lift me up.\n So my balance is not great as we can see. Stand on it? What's amazing is that this doesn't require much pressure above atmospheric, just a tenth of an atmosphere applied over a large area like a square\n meter can lift something as heavy as a thousand kilograms, all the while remaining soft. That's the paradoxical thing about pressure, you can get a large overall force with\n low pressure as long as the area is large enough.\n really soft. Yeah, because there's a couple PSI, right? It's important that the device is still soft so it doesn't hurt anyone. So you can design these things to have cross-section that changes along its length, so it could be a very small body that could grow into\n These robots can also be deployed\n in search and rescue operations by attaching sensors like a camera onto the front. These robots are actually really hard to stop, so you can take them, throw them into a clutter, potentially a collapsed building or something like that, and they will continue to go.\n But how do you keep a\n camera connected to the front of the robot when it grows out from the tip. Well one way is to use an end cap which allows that camera just to stay on the front pushed from behind by the robot but there are other mechanisms of attachment. The tiny wireless camera is\n mounted on an external frame. But this frame interlocks with an internal frame which is actually inside the pressurized part of the robot body. It's similar to how a roller coaster's wheels go around the track. So this prevents the camera\n from falling off as the robot grows. What's really interesting is how the Vine robot can be actively steered. They attach artificial muscles to the robot. So the way this muscle works\n is that if you inflate it, it expands sideways, which leads to it contracting in length. We don't actually use these much anymore because although it's soft, it's still somewhat stiff, so what we use instead are simply tubes of this ripstop knife.\n nylon fabric with the braid oriented at 45 degrees. So in this sense, we just have one single layer of airtight fabric. This is the main robot body here. Then we have three pneumatic muscles connected to it. Now these three muscles are\n connected to their own air supply connected to regulators over here. As the robot extends from the tip we can steer it by shortening and lengthening the sides. So you know just the way your hand works is if I shorten this tendon in my arm my hand will move this way or if I shorten the one on this side it'll move the\n So our vine robot, we have these muscles along its side, so as they inflate, they'll turn it one way. Then if I inflate the one on the other side, it'll turn the other way. So the vine robot can fit through tight spaces, it doesn't typically get stuck on anything, and isn't bothered by sharp\n objects and once you attach that camera on the front it's ideal for things like archaeology. The robot was actually taken to Peru to investigate some very narrow shafts. So we were looking\n We're looking at this archaeological site that was built somewhere between 1500 and 500 BC in the Andes Mountains of Peru. And it was an ancient temple that had all these underground spaces. And part of what the archaeologists\n were doing was trying to understand what the spaces were for and what the people who built them were trying to do with them. So part of that was unknown, but there were these giant rooms that they called galleries and then there were these small ducts or tunnels that\n were offshoots of these rooms and they wanted to know where these ducts led but they were too small for a person to go in so we were able to successfully use the Vinerabot to explore three of the tunnels that couldn't have been seen through other means which was super\n There's an application where I feel like this solution is just so obvious I wonder why it didn't exist before.\n is literally the process of putting a tube into a patient. The purpose is to breathe for the patient when the patient isn't breathing. And so traditionally, a highly trained medical professional would take their laryngoscope, come above the patient, and once\n see the trachea, you start to pass your tube down inside. I'm almost there. I can see the light. So if you can see right now, I just got it in to the trachea.\n right there. And it took me a couple minutes and I was really kind of wrenching on this this patient here. If there's somebody who's not breathing, every second counts. But by using a miniature version of this vine robot,\n researchers are hoping to make intubation faster and safer. You know somebody like me with no training could pretty simply insert this device aim towards the nose and\n Just like that if you can see we've already intubated and all it took was a little bit of pressurization. Just like that. It almost looks like a sort of a party favor. Yeah right it's like this reminds me\n a lot of those inflatable kind of like play-doh structures you see at car lots. How does it know to go down the right tube? Yeah so that's one of the kind of cool things about soft robotics is the robot is quite compliant and we see that in a lot of these\n demos, you know, they can squish, they can bend. And so how we've designed it is that the main robot grows down into the esophagus, and then we have this side branch that heads towards the trachea, and it's quite flexible, and so it basically finds the opening. So it's really\n example of kind of a passive intelligence, mechanical intelligence some people call it, where it can find its path even if we don't know exactly the shape beforehand. Have you tried this on a real person yet? Not on a real person, but we've actually\n There's another application, which is\n into sand or soil. When you blow compressed air into something like sand, it fluidizes. It becomes like a liquid and that can allow the vine robot to grow into granular materials like sand.\n If you've ever been to the beach and you try to stick your umbrella pole into the ground, it's fairly difficult. I'm gonna try to push that probe down into the sand, no fluidization. Yeah, it feels like it sort of gets wedged in there.\n on the air. Oh yeah, you can feel it immediately. Oh wow, yeah that's a lot. So what we've done here is essentially we just blow a jet of air out the front of the robot.\n and that loosens up the sand enough to reduce the force of the sand so that the robot, just by tip extension, can make its way through.\n This makes Vine Robots an attractive option for NASA when they look for ways to study the surfaces of other planets.\n Recently on Mars they tried to have a burrowing robot but it got stuck. Could you do it better basically with this? Yeah that's a good question. So the Mars InSight mission they have this heat probe. The idea there was to be able to sort of hammer its way down into\n the core and then place a sensor that could detect the temperature of Mars. However, the problem they ran into there is that it turned out the material that they put it in was more cohesive than they expected. Inside the robot something would wind up and then pound it down, wind up and\n pound it down. But it turned out there wasn't enough friction between the probe and the sand. So what was really happening was it would wind up, pound down, wind up, pound down, wind up, pound down. So it would never actually go anywhere. The advantage of something like this, like tip extension, is you'd have your base, you start at the surface,\n What amazes me about Vine Robots is how a plant inspired this simple\n It's so easy in fact that you could build one yourself in as little as a minute. There are instructions online that I'll link to. But from that basic design have come a huge variety of robots with different applications from archaeologists,\n to search and rescue? Or intubation to space exploration? And what else can you think of to do with it? Hey, this video is\n is\n together, but I still want to stay informed.

            "transcription": "For hundreds of years, analog computers were the most powerful computers on Earth, predicting eclipses, tides, and guiding anti-aircraft guns. Then, with the advent of solid-state transistors, digital computers took off.\n Actually, every computer we use is digital. But today, a perfect storm of factors is setting the scene for a resurgence of analog technology. This is an analog computer, and by connecting these wires in particular ways\n I can program it to solve a whole range of differential equations. For example, this setup allows me to simulate a damped mass oscillating on a spring. So on the oscilloscope, you can actually see the position of the mass over time.\n And I can vary the damping or the spring constant or the mass and we can see how the amplitude and duration of the oscillations change. Now what makes this an analog computer\n is that there are no zeros and ones in here. Instead, there's actually a voltage that oscillates up and down exactly like a mass on a spring. The electrical circuitry is an analog for the physical problem. It just takes\n place much faster. Now if I change the electrical connections I can program this computer to solve other differential equations like the Lorentz system which is a basic model of convection in the atmosphere. Now the Lorentz system is famous because it was one of the first\n discovered examples of chaos and here you can see the Lorentz attractor with its beautiful butterfly shape and on this analog computer I can change the parameters and see their effects in real time.\n So these examples illustrate some of the advantages of analog computers. They are incredibly powerful computing devices and they can complete a lot of computations fast. Plus they don't take much power to do it.\n With a digital computer, if you want to add two 8-bit numbers, you need around 50 transistors. Whereas with an analog computer, you can add two currents just by connecting two wires.\n With a digital computer to multiply two numbers you need on the order of a thousand transistors all switching zeros and ones whereas with an analog computer you can pass a current through a resistor and then the voltage across the\n resistor will be I times R so effectively you have multiplied two numbers together. But analog computers also have their drawbacks. For one thing they are not general purpose\n computing devices. I mean you're not going to run Microsoft Word on this thing. And also since the inputs and outputs are continuous I can't input exact values. So if I try to repeat the same calculation I'm never going to get the\n exact same answer. Plus think about manufacturing analog computers. There's always going to be some variation in the exact value of components like resistors or capacitors. So as a general rule of thumb you can expect about a 1% error\n So, when you think of analog computers, you can think powerful, fast, and energy efficient, but also single-purpose, non-repeatable, and inexact. And if those sound like deal-breakers, it's because they probably are.\n I think these are the major reasons why analog computers fell out of favor as soon as digital computers became viable. Now, here is why analog computers may be making a comeback.\n artificial intelligence. AI isn't new. The term was coined back in 1956. In 1958, Cornell University psychologist Frank Rosenblatt built\n the perceptron, designed to mimic how neurons fire in our brains. So here's a basic model of how neurons in our brains work. An individual neuron can either fire or not, so its level of activation can be represented as a one\n or a zero. The input to one neuron is the output from a bunch of other neurons, but the strength of these connections between neurons varies, so each one can be given a different weight. Some connections are excitatory, so they have\n positive weights, while others are inhibitory, so they have negative weights. And the way to figure out whether a particular neuron fires is to take the activation of each input neuron and multiply by its weight, and then add these all together. If there's\n If the atom is greater than some number, called the bias, then the neuron fires. But if it's less than that, the neuron doesn't fire. As input, Rosenblatt's perceptron had 400 photocells arranged in a square grid to capture a\n 20 by 20 pixel image. You can think of each pixel as an input neuron, with its activation being the brightness of the pixel. Although strictly speaking the activation should be either 0 or 1, we can let it take any value between 0 and\n All of these neurons are connected to a single output neuron, each via its own adjustable weight. So to see if the output neuron will fire, you multiply the activation of each neuron by its weight and add them together.\n This is essentially a vector dot product. If the answer is larger than the bias, the neuron fires, and if not, it doesn't. Now, the goal of the perceptron was to reliably distinguish between two images, like a rectangle and a rectangle.\n a circle. For example, the output neuron could always fire when presented with a circle, but never when presented with a rectangle. To achieve this, the perceptron had to be trained, that is, shown a series of different circles and rectangles, and have\n its weights adjusted accordingly. We can visualize the weights as an image, since there's a unique weight for each pixel of the image. Initially, Rosenblatt set all the weights to zero. If the perceptron's output is correct, for example\n Here, it's shown a rectangle and the output neuron doesn't fire. No change is made to the weights. But if it's wrong, then the weights are adjusted. The algorithm for updating the weights is remarkably simple. Here, the output neuron didn't fire when it was\n supposed to because it was shown a circle. So to modify the weights you simply add the input activations to the weights. If the output neuron fires when it shouldn't, like here when shown a rectangle, well then you subtract the input activations\n activations from the weights. And you keep doing this until the perceptron correctly identifies all the training images. It was shown that this algorithm will always converge so long as it's possible to map the two categories into distinct groups.\n The perceptron was capable of distinguishing between different shapes like rectangles and triangles or between different letters and according to Rosenblatt it could even tell the difference between cats and dogs. He said the machine was\n was capable of what amounts to original thought. And the media lapped it up. The New York Times called the perceptron the embryo of an electronic computer that the Navy expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce,\n produce itself, and be conscious of its existence.\n In reality, the perceptron was pretty limited in what it could do. It could not, in fact, tell apart dogs from cats. This and other critiques were raised in a book by MIT giants Minsky and Papert in 1969, and that led to a bust\n for artificial neural networks and AI in general. It's known as the first AI winter. Rosenblatt did not survive this winter. He drowned while sailing in Chesapeake Bay on his 43rd birthday.\n In the 1980s, there was an AI resurgence when researchers at Carnegie Mellon created\n of the first self-driving cars. The vehicle was steered by an artificial neural network called Alvin. It was similar to the Perceptron, except it had a hidden layer of artificial neurons between the input and output. As input, Alvin received\n 30x32 pixel images of the road ahead. Here I'm showing them as 60x64 pixels. But each of these input neurons was connected via an adjustable weight to a hidden layer of four neurons. These were each connected to 32\n output neurons. So to go from one layer of the network to the next, you perform a matrix multiplication. The input activation times the weights. The output neuron with the greatest activation determines the steering angle.\n To train the neural net, a human drove the vehicle, providing the correct steering angle for a given input image. All the weights in the neural network were adjusted through the training so that Alvin's output better matched that of the human driver.\n The method for adjusting the weights is called backpropagation, which I won't go into here, but Welch Labs has a great series on this which I'll link to in the description. Again, you can visualize the weights for the four hidden neurons as images.\n are initially set to be random, but as training progresses, the computer learns to pick up on certain patterns. You can see the road markings emerge in the weights. Simultaneously, the output steering angle coalesces onto the human steering angle.\n The computer drove the vehicle at a top speed of around 1 or 2 kilometers per hour. It was limited by the speed at which the computer could perform matrix multiplication. Despite these advances, artificial neural networks\n still struggled with seemingly simple tasks like telling apart cats and dogs. And no one knew whether hardware or software was the weak link. I mean, did we have a good model of intelligence we just needed more computer power? Or did we have the wrong\n about how to make intelligent systems altogether. So artificial intelligence experienced another lull in the 1990s. By the mid-2000s, most AI researchers were focused on improving algorithms, but one researcher, Fei-Fei\n Lee thought maybe there was a different problem. Maybe these artificial neural networks just needed more data to train on. So she planned to map out the entire world of objects. From 2006 to 2009 she created ImageNet, a database of one\n 1.2 million human-labeled images, which at the time was the largest labeled image dataset ever constructed. And from 2010 to 2017, ImageNet ran an annual contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, where software programs compete\n to correctly detect and classify images. Images were classified into a thousand different categories, including 90 different dog breeds. A neural network competing this competition would have an output layer of a thousand neurons, each corresponding to a category of\n Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be a tough challenge. One way to judge the performance of an AI\n is to see how often the five highest neuron activations do not include the correct category. This is the so-called top five error rate. In 2010, the best performer had a top five error rate of 28.2%, meaning that nearly\n Only a third of the time, the correct answer was not among its top five guesses. In 2011, the error rate of the best performer was 25.8%, a substantial improvement. But the next year, an artificial neural network from the University of Toronto\n called AlexNet, blew away the competition with a top five error rate of just 16.4%. What set AlexNet apart was its size and depth. The network consisted of eight layers and in total 500,000 neurons.\n To train AlexNet, 60 million weights and biases had to be carefully adjusted using the training database. Because of all the big matrix multiplications, processing a single image required 700 million individual math operations.\n So training was computationally intensive. The team managed it by pioneering the use of GPUs, graphical processing units, which are traditionally used for driving displays, screens. So they're specialized for fast parallel computations.\n The AlexNet paper describing their research is a blockbuster. It's now been cited over a hundred thousand times, and it identifies the scale of the neural network as key to its success. It takes a lot of computation to train\n and run the network, but the improvement in performance is worth it. With others following their lead, the top five error rate on the ImageNet competition plummeted in the years that followed, down to 3.6% in 2015. That is better than human\n performance. The neural network that achieved this had a hundred layers of neurons. So the future is clear. We will see ever increasing demand for ever larger neural networks. And this is a problem for several reasons. One is energy consumption.\n Training a neural network requires an amount of electricity similar to the yearly consumption of three households. Another issue is the so-called von Neumann bottleneck. Virtually every modern digital computer stores data in memory and then accesses it as needed over a bus.\n When performing the huge matrix multiplications required by deep neural networks, most of the time and energy goes into fetching those weight values rather than actually doing the computation. And finally, there are the limitations of Moore's law. For decades, the number of transistors on\n a chip has been doubling approximately every two years, but now the size of a transistor is approaching the size of an atom, so there are some fundamental physical challenges to further miniaturization. So this is the perfect storm for analog computers.\n digital computers are reaching their limits. Meanwhile, neural networks are exploding in popularity and a lot of what they do boils down to a single task, matrix multiplication. Best of all, neural networks don't need the precision of digital computers.\n Whether the neural net is 96% or 98% confident the image contains a chicken, it doesn't really matter. It's still a chicken. So slight variability in components or conditions can be tolerated. I went to an analog computer\n computing startup in Texas called Mythic AI. Here they're creating analog chips to run neural networks, and they demonstrated several AI algorithms for me.\n The biggest use case is augmented in virtual reality. You know, if your friend is in a different, you know, they're at their house and you're at your house, you can actually render each other in the virtual world. So it needs to really quickly capture your pose and then render it in the VR world.\n for the metaverse then? This is very metaverse application. This is depth estimation from just a single webcam. It's just taking this scene and then it's doing like a heat map so if it's bright it means it's close. If it's far away it makes it\n Now, all these algorithms can be run on digital computers, but here the matrix multiplication is actually taking place in the analog domain. To make this possible, Mythic has repurposed digital flash storage cells.\n These are used as memory to store either a 1 or a 0. If you apply a large positive voltage to the control gate, electrons tunnel up through an insulating barrier and become trapped on the floating gate. Remove the voltage, and the electrons can remain on the floating gate.\n You can read out the stored value by applying a small voltage. If there are electrons on the floating gate, no current flows, so that's a zero.\n Aren't electrons, then current does flow, and that's a one. Now, Mythic's idea is to use these cells not as on-off switches, but as variable resistors. They do this by putting a specific number of electrons on each floating gate, instead of all or nothing.\n The greater the number of electrons, the higher the resistance of the channel. When you later apply a small voltage, the current that flows is equal to V over R. But you can also think of this as voltage times conductance, where conductance\n is just the reciprocal of resistance. So a single flash cell can be used to multiply two values together, voltage times conductance. So to use this to run an artificial neural network, they first write all the weights to the flash cells as\n cells conductance. Then they input the activation values as the voltage on the cells. And the resulting current is the product of voltage times conductance, which is activation times weight. The cells are wired together\n in such a way that the current from each multiplication adds together, completing the matrix multiplication. So this is our first product. This can do 25 trillion math operations per second.\n 25 trillion. 25 trillion math operations per second in this little chip here burning about three watts of power. How does it compare to a digital chip? The newer digital systems can do anywhere from 25 to 100 trillion operations per second.\n second but they are big thousand dollar systems that are spitting out you know 50 to 100 watts of power. Obviously this isn't like an apples to apples comparison right? It's not apples to apples I mean you know it training those algorithms you need big hardware like this\n You can just do all sorts of stuff on the GPU, but if you specifically are doing AI workloads and you want to deploy them, you could use this instead. You can imagine them in security cameras, autonomous systems, inspection equipment for manufacturing. Every time they make like a\n Some have proposed using analog circuitry in smart home speakers solely to listen for\n wake word like Alexa or Siri. They would use a lot less power and be able to quickly and reliably turn on the digital circuitry of the device. But you still have to deal with the challenges of analog. So for one of the popular networks there would be 50\n sequences of matrix multiplies that you're doing. Now if you did that entirely in the analog domain, by the time it gets to the output it's just so distorted that you don't have any result at all. So you convert it from the analog domain back to the digital domain, send it to the next\n processing block and then you convert it into the analog domain again and that allows you to preserve the signal. You know when Rosenblatt was first setting up his perceptron he used a digital IBM computer. Finding it too slow he built a custom analog\n analog computer, complete with variable resistors and little motors to drive them. Ultimately, his idea of neural networks turned out to be right. Maybe he was right about analog too. Now, I can't say whether analog\n computers will take off the way digital did last century, but they do seem to be better suited to a lot of the tasks that we want computers to perform today. Which is a little bit funny because I always thought of digital as the optimal way of processing\n information. You know, everything from music to pictures to video has all gone digital in the last 50 years. But maybe in a hundred years we will look back on digital not as the endpoint of information technology,\n But as a starting point, our brains are digital in that a neuron either fires or it doesn't, but they're also analog in that thinking takes place everywhere all at once. So maybe what we need\n To achieve true artificial intelligence, machines that think like us is the power of analog.

            "transcription": "Right now, some nation states and individual actors are intercepting and storing lots of encrypted data, like passwords, bank details, and social security numbers. But they can't open these files, so why are they doing it?\n Well, because they believe that within the next 10 to 20 years, they will have access to a quantum computer that can break the encryption in minutes. This procedure is known as Store Now, Decrypt Later, or SNDL.\n And it works because there is information around today that will still be valuable in a decade. Things like industrial and pharmaceutical research and top secret government intelligence. And everyone is aware of this threat. The National Security Administration says that\n In a 5-10 year time frame, quantum computing will break encryption as we know it today.\n computers are still years away, they're already a threat because of store now decrypt later. Which is why the US Congress just passed legislation mandating all agencies start transitioning right now to new methods of cryptography that can't be broken by\n quantum computers.\n meet up in person and share a secret key. This same key would be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, so it's known as a symmetric key algorithm. As long as no one else gets their hands on the key, your messages are\n But now, what if you want to send information to someone you've never met, and it's too hard to arrange an in-person meeting? You can't share a key over an unsecure channel, like a phone line or the mail, because it could be intercepted.\n And this is what, in 1977, led three scientists, Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman, to come up with an encryption breakthrough. Today it's known by their initials, RSA. And it works something like this.\n Every person has two really big prime numbers, all their own, which they keep secret. They multiply these numbers together to get an even bigger number, which they make public for everyone to see. Now, if I want to send someone a private message,\n I use their big public number to garble my message and I garble it in such a way that it is impossible to ungarble without knowing the two prime factors that made that number. This is an asymmetric key system since\n different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the message. So it's easy for my intended recipient to decode, but impossible for everyone else unless they can factor that large public number.\n Now, someone could try to factor it using a supercomputer in the best known factoring algorithm, the general number field sieve, but modern cryptography uses prime numbers that are around 313 digits long. Factoring a product of two primes this big, even with a supercomputer\n A computer would take around 16 million years. But not on a quantum computer. See, in normal computers, a bit can only be in one state at a time, either a zero or a one. So if you had two bits, they could be in one state.\n of four possible states, 00, 01, 10, or 11. Let's say each of these states represents a number, 0, 1, 2, or 3. If we want to do a calculation, for example raising 7 to the power of one of these numbers,\n we can only do it for one state at a time, in this case 7 squared, and so we get the answer 49. Quantum computers consist of qubits, which also have two states, 0 or 1, but unlike a classical bit,\n a qubit doesn't have to be in just one state at a time. It can be in an arbitrary combination of those states, a superposition, if you will, of 0 and 1. So if you have two qubits, they can exist simultaneously in a superposition\n of 0, 1, 2, and 3. Now when we repeat the same calculation, it will actually perform the calculation for all of those numbers at the same time. And what we're left with is a superposition of\n the different answers 1, 7, 49, and 343. If we add another qubit, we double the number of possible states. So with three qubits, we can represent eight states, and thus perform eight calculations\n Increase that number to just 20 qubits and you can already represent over a million different states, meaning you can simultaneously compute over a million different answers. With 300 qubits, you can represent more\n This sounds incredibly powerful, and it is, but there is one very big catch. All of the answers to the computation are embedded in a superposition of states.\n But you can't simply read out this superposition. When you make a measurement, you only get a single value from the superposition, basically at random, and all the other information is lost. So in order to harness the power of a quantum computer,\n This is an incredibly difficult task, which is why for most applications, quantum computers are useless. So far, we've only identified\n In 1994, Peter Shor and Don Coppersmith figured out\n how to take a quantum Fourier transform. It works just like a normal Fourier transform, apply it to some periodic signal and it returns the frequencies that are in that signal. Now this may not seem particularly interesting, but consider this. If we\n a superposition of states that is periodic, that is the terms in the superposition are separated by some regular amount, well we can apply the quantum Fourier transform and we'll be left with states that contain the frequency of the signal. So this we can measure.\n The quantum Fourier transform allows us to extract frequency information from a periodic superposition. And that is going to come in handy. So how does a quantum computer factor the product of two primes much faster than\n than a conventional computer. I want to explain this by first walking through a simple example with no quantum computer required, and then I'll show how a quantum computer could execute this method even for a very large number in a short period of time.\n So let's say we have a number n, which is the product of two primes, p and q. For the sake of this example, let's set n equal to 77. Now, I bet you can guess the prime factors, but let's pretend for the moment that we don't know them.\n because with a product of really big primes, we wouldn't. Now I want to use a fact about numbers that feels like magic. Pick a number, G, that doesn't share any factors with N. If you multiply G by itself over\n over and over and over, you will always, eventually, reach a multiple of n plus 1. In other words, you can always find some exponent r, such that g to the power of r is a multiple of n plus\n Let's see how this works. Pick any number that is smaller than 77. I'll pick the number 8. This number doesn't share factors with 77, and if you were doing this with big primes, it would also be extremely unlikely that you would just happen to pick a number that\n shares factors with n. Now multiply 8 by itself, once, twice, three times, four times, and so on, raising 8 to ever higher powers. And then divide each of these numbers by 77. We're not\n Not really interested in how many times 77 goes into the number, just the remainder, what's left over. Because at some point, 77 should divide one of these numbers with a remainder of exactly 1. So 8 divided by 77 is 0 with a remainder of 1.\n And as we keep going, we get\n So there we have it. 8 to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. So we've found the exponent r that satisfies this equation.\n But how does this help find the factors of n? Well, we rearrange the equation to bring 1 over to the left hand side, and then we can split it into two terms, like so. And now, as long as r is even, we have\n one integer times another integer is equal to a multiple of n. This looks remarkably similar to p times q equals n. I mean, since we know that p and q are on the right hand side of this equation, they must also\n be on the left hand side, just multiplied by some additional factors. So one way to think about what we've done is we've taken a bad guess for one of the factors, g, and by finding the exponent r, we've turned it into\n two much better guesses that probably do share factors with n. Since r was 10, the two terms on the left hand side are 8 to the power of 5 plus 1, 32,769, and 8 to the power\n of 5 minus 1, 32,767. These two numbers probably share factors with n. So how do we find them? We use Euclid's algorithm. If you want to find the greatest common\n divisor of two numbers, say 32,769 and 77, divide the bigger number by the smaller one and record the remainder. In this case, 32,769 divided by 77 gives a remainder of 44.\n Then, shift the numbers one position left and repeat. So now we divide 77 by 44 and we get a remainder of 33. Repeat the process again. 44 divided by 33 gives a remainder of 11.\n And again, 33 divided by 11 equals 3 remainder 0. When the remainder is 0, the divisor is the greatest common factor between the two numbers you started with. In this case, it's 11, which is indeed a factor of 7.\n 77 x 11 to get 7, its other prime factor. So to recap, if you want to find the prime factors p and\n Q of a number n, first, make a bad guess g. Second, find out how many times r you have to multiply g by itself to reach one more than a multiple of n. Third, use that exponent to calculate two new numbers that probably\n Now, you don't need a quantum computer to run any of these steps, but on\n a classical computer, this method wouldn't be any faster than other methods. The key process that a quantum computer speeds up is step two, finding the exponent you raise g to to equal one more than a multiple of n. To see why,\n Let's go back to our example where 8 to the power of 10 is one more than a multiple of 77. Watch what happens to the remainders if we keep going past 8 to the power of 10 to 8 to the 11, 8 to the 12, and so on. Well, we get\n Remainders of 8, 64, 50, 15, 43, 36, 57, 71, 29, and again 1. The remainders cycle.\n And they will just keep cycling. Notice how the exponent that yields a remainder of 1 is 20, which is 10 more than the first exponent that yielded a remainder of 1. So we know that 8 to the 30 and 8 to the 40, 8 raised to any power divisible\n It's also worth noting that if you pick any remainder, say 15, the next time you find that same remainder, the exponent will have increased by 10.\n So you can find the exponent r that gets us to one more than a multiple of n by looking at the spacing of any remainder, not just one. Remember that. Here I'm plotting out the remainders on a log scale so you can see they are\n periodic with a period of 10. If I had made a different guess, say I had picked G equals 15 instead of 8, well then the period would be different and the remainders would be different, but there would always be a remainder of 1.\n Why is this? Well, now that you can see this is a repeating pattern, we can go back to the beginning. And any number raised to the power of zero is one. So that is actually the first remainder.\n it must also appear when the cycle starts again. Now we are ready to use a quantum computer to factor any large product of two primes. First, we split up the qubits into two sets. The first set we prepare in a superposition of\n 0 and 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8 and 9 all the way up to 10 to the power of 1234. Yeah, this is a huge superposition, but if we had perfect\n cubic qubits, it would require only around 4100. The other set contains a similar number of qubits, all left in the zero state for now. Now we make our guess G, which most likely doesn't share factors\n with n. We raise g to the power of the first set of qubits, divide by n, and store the remainder in the second set of qubits, leaving the first set of qubits as it was. Now we have a\n superposition of all the numbers we started with and the remainder of raising g to the power of those numbers divided by n. And through this operation we have entangled our two sets of qubits. But we can't just measure\n this superposition, if we did we would get a random value and learn nothing. But there is a trick we can use. If we don't measure the entire superposition, but only the remainder part, we will obtain some random remainder. But this remainder\n Imagine we were doing this with the example from before, with n equals 77 and g equals 8. If the remainder we measured was\n If G was 15, then there would be multiple terms in our superposition, because there are multiple exponents you can raise G to that give this same remainder. Exponents 4, 14, 24, 34, and so on.\n separated by 10. And that value is the exponent that satisfies our equation. So more generally, after measuring the remainder, we will be left with a superposition of states that all share the same remainder. And the exponents\n will all be separated by the same amount r. This is the number we are looking for. Since the remainder is now the same for all states, we can put it to the side. And we now have a superposition that is periodic. Each term\n is separated from its neighbors by an amount r. If we now apply the quantum Fourier transform to this superposition of states, and I'm simplifying a little here, we will be left with states containing 1 over r. So all that's left to do now is perform a measure\n measurement, and find r by inverting it. And that's it for the quantum part. Now as long as r turns out to be even, we can use r to turn our bad guess g into two numbers that likely share factors with n. And as long as these\n terms themselves are not a multiple of n, we can use Euclid's algorithm to find the factors of n and break the encryption. This would only take several thousand perfect qubits, but the qubits we have today are imperfect, so we need additional qubits to act\n as redundant information. In 2012, it was estimated that it would take a billion physical qubits to break RSA encryption. But by five years later, that number had dropped to 230 million. And in 2019, after more technological\n breakthroughs, that estimate plummeted to just 20 million physical qubits. So how many qubits do we have today? Well, if we look at the state of IBM's quantum computers, we are nowhere near that number of qubits.\n But progress looks to be exponential. So now it's just a question of when these two curves will collide before all our existing public key encryption can be broken. Because we've long known this threat is coming,\n Scientists have been looking for new ways to encrypt data which can withstand attacks from both normal and quantum computers. In 2016 the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST launched a competition to find new encryption algorithms that aren't vulnerable to quantum\n cryptographers from all over the world submitted 82 different proposals which were rigorously tested, some were broken, and then on July 5th, 2022, NIST selected four of the algorithms to be part of their post-quantum cryptographic standard.\n So, how do they work? Well, three of the algorithms are based on the mathematics of lattices. So let's do a simple example in the 2D plane. Take two vectors, r1 and r2. By adding together different integer\n combinations of these vectors, say 3 times r1 and 1 times r2, you can get to different points. And all the points you can get to by combining these two vectors in different ways is what is called a lattice. Now, I will also give you the point\n c, and your task is to tell me which combination of r1 and r2 will bring me to the lattice point closest to c. It's pretty easy to see that we can get there by going in the direction of r2 twice and in the negative direction of r1 twice.\n Simple enough. But those vectors r1 and r2 are not the only vectors that can give you this lattice. Take b1 and b2 for example. These vectors also build up the same lattice. And now if I ask you the same question\n again, can you tell me the combination of b1 and b2 that gets you to the lattice point closest to c? This has become a lot harder, but why is that? Each time we are taking a step, we are trying to get closer in either the x or y\n direction. But with the b vectors, each time we take a step in the right direction with one vector, it puts us off in the other direction. And that's why these vectors are a lot harder to work with. In the end, it takes us a combination of 8 times b1,\n and negative 6 times b2 to get to the closest lattice point. That is a lot harder than before, but it's still a relatively easy problem to solve. But if we extend it to three dimensions, this already becomes a lot harder, especially\n Especially because you're not given the collection of all lattice points, you're only given the vectors that make it up. So when you find a lattice point close to the target, you must still find all the other lattice points near it to make sure yours is indeed the closest.\n of radius r in two dimensions. The number of lattice points inside the circle is proportional to r squared. Add a third dimension, and the number of points in the sphere is proportional to r cubed. So just watch how the number of lattice points grows as\n we increase the number of dimensions. Solving the closest vector problem is a piece of cake for your computer in 3D. Even 100 dimensions should be manageable. But in proposed future encryption schemes, we'll use around\n around 1000 dimensions. Take one step in the right direction on one of those dimensions, and you could potentially be taking a wrong step in the other 999 dimensions. You win some, you lose everything else.\n With that many dimensions, it becomes extremely hard to find the closest point, even for the most powerful computers. That is, unless you know a good set of vectors. So how do we use that to encrypt data? Well, let's go back to our two-dimensional\n example. Each person has a good set of vectors that describes a lattice, but they keep these vectors secret, and they only share their lattice publicly using a set of vectors that is hard to work with. Now, if I want to send someone a message, I\n If I pick a point on their lattice, for example, say this point corresponds to the number 7, so if I want to send the number 7, I can take that point, but then add some random noise to it. So the message I send is not precisely at that point.\n point, but close to it. Now to decode the message, my recipient must figure out which lattice point is closest to the message point. In a thousand dimensions, this will be extremely hard to do unless you have the nice set of\n vectors, which my recipient does. So it's easy for the recipient, who has the good vectors, but hard for everyone else. And as far as we know, this problem is extremely difficult to solve for both normal and quantum computers.\n Behind the scenes, there's an army of researchers, mathematicians, and cryptographers working to make sure your secret data stays secret. These are some of the unsung heroes that will keep us safe moving forward, avoiding mass surveillance by governments, keeping critical\n infrastructure protected and allowing you to live as if quantum computers were never invented in the first place. Something that fascinates me is\n being able to see where the world is headed. And right now it's clear that quantum computers and AI chatbots are going to play bigger and bigger roles in our lives in the coming decades. Even if we don't know exactly how they'll be implemented, I think it's important to learn how they work\n work right now. And you can do that with this video's sponsor, Brilliant.

            "transcription": "Alright, I'm about to go for my first ever ride in a fully autonomous vehicle. Woah, no driver. Alright.\n Morning Derek this car is all yours with no one up front I really like the idea of fully autonomous vehicles But it's weird getting into a car with no driver and just trusting the car. I'm gonna report back\n how this ride goes, how I feel about it. Oh, but full disclosure, this video is sponsored by Waymo. Start ride.\n Haha! Okay. Now let's see where we go. It's looking at this car coming here. What's it gonna do?\n pulls in very smoothly behind it. No problems, did not turn into traffic, waited until the cars went and then it turned. I like that. I polled YouTube viewers about autonomous vehicles and half of\n you are excited and ready for them to be on the roads, but over 40% said you thought the technology was still over 10 years away. And for those people, I have news, which is that, well, there is no driver in this\n car. I'm currently inside a fully autonomous vehicle driving around a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. Now I get that in some parts of the world, like the roads aren't well enough maintained and you know, people don't stay in their lane necessarily. And so\n be very hard for a computer to drive there, but at least under good conditions, the technology is currently functional. Now Waymo started out\n as the Google self-driving car project with what is possibly one of the cutest cars ever made. I am inside the world's first fully autonomous vehicle. Back in October 2015,\n This car went on a public road ridden by Steve Mann who has a disability. He is legally blind But he could get around in this thing which is affectionately known as the Firefly. This is such a simple vehicle\n There's basically nothing in here. There's no steering wheel. No dashboard. This car is super basic There is no AC but there is an emergency stop button That's my favorite button in the car. It reminds me of elevators, you know\n One of the important measures that they had to put in automatic elevators was a big red stop button. Did you know that before the 1940s almost all elevators had drivers in them? And when people started putting in driverless elevators?\n Well, the public was very concerned and they didn't want to ride in those elevators. There was one guy who was like, I don't care if I have to walk up 12 flights of stairs for the rest of my life. I'm not taking that elevator. And adoption was slow. I mean, they tried to advertise to help people understand that it was in fact safe.\n But ultimately there was an elevator drivers strike in New York City and that really annoyed people and it helped the adoption of automated elevators. If you found a driver in an elevator today you would wonder, why are they there?\n Now you might think an elevator is just so simple. I mean, it is effectively one dimensional motion. But, you know, airplanes are also flown extensively by computers. I saw this particular landing where a plane\n The plane is coming in into Vienna and it's just so foggy that the pilots can see almost nothing. I mean, this is the view from the cockpit. And yet they make a perfect textbook landing right on target. So how do they do it?\n The answer is the pilots didn't do it. It was a cat three auto land procedure. The plane just came in and landed itself essentially. Now, of course the pilots are important and they're monitoring all of the instruments and controls.\n but it's actually the plane and its computer getting the plane to land appropriately. I was surprised to learn that humans are much more likely to take manual control and land on sunny days like July 6th 2013.\n when Asiana Airlines flight 214 was on final approach to San Francisco. Attempting to manually land the plane, the pilot accidentally left the throttle at zero. And by the time they realized and tried to abort the landing, it was too late.\n The plane crashed into the runway seawall and split in two. Three people died in the aftermath of this accident. I think the counterintuitive thing is that we expect the humans to\n to be better, particularly in tough situations. But when it comes to airplanes, if it's bad weather, you actually want the plane flying itself. So the obvious next question is, would you want the same thing for cars?\n There are all these different levels of autonomy and everything up to four requires a human driver to be you know responsible and at the wheel at all times. In the early days of the Google self-driving car project they had a vehicle that was not yet level four so it still\n Google required a human driver. They let Google employees borrow the cars, but they still had to be in control of the wheel. And the volunteers were informed that they were responsible for the car at all times and that they would be constantly recorded, like video recorded while they were in the\n But still, within a short period of time, the engineers observed drivers rummaging around in their bags or checking phones, putting on makeup, or even sleeping in the driver's seat. All these drivers were trusting the technology to much.\n much, which makes almost fully autonomous vehicles potentially more dangerous than regular cars. I mean, if the driver is distracted or not prepared to take over. So this is why Waymo decided that the only safe way to proceed is with a car that\n at least level 4 autonomy. This is the depot where the cars go when they're not on the road. It's also where people monitor all the rides in progress.\n You see three teams basically here. One of the teams is my team of fleet dispatchers. So basically making sure that all the missions are assigned every day and they are completed successfully on road. And then you have the rider support team that takes the calls.\n Thank you for calling the Waymo Rider Support. This is Eula. How can I help today? I just completed my ride, but like I don't want to get out of the car. I just want to keep driving. Is there a way that I can do that? Right now I don't see a trip started. Give me one moment here while I partner with my\n Okay? Okay. Well, I just left all my stuff in the car. I hope it comes back.\n I think there's a lot of still resistance in terms of trusting the vehicle and they ask you like how does it feel to be in a car without the driver. I was the first person\n If the system really provides that,\n feeling that you're safe and you see a couple of maneuvers, in less than two minutes you're talking to whoever is next to you and not paying attention to what's happening anymore. What? All right, it doesn't make the indicator sound.\n So I just don't know when it's going to turn. But if I was watching the map, I would know. I think we have this bias to believe that we're better at certain tasks than we actually are. Like, thinking\n that people are good at driving. Surveys show 74% of people believe they are above average drivers. Think about that. In the 20th century, 60 million people were killed on the road. That's basically an extra world\n world war's worth of deaths. And we really have no one to blame but ourselves. The National Transportation and Safety Board has identified human error as the cause of 94% of accidents. Most of these errors are impossible for a machine to make.\n Every year when people are backing out of driveways or parking spaces, in the US up to 200 people are killed and it's frequently older people or children, the children of the drivers. It's awful.\n And it comes down to the fact that we don't have eyes in the back of our head and even the backup cameras You know still have blind spots, but if you have a vehicle that has you know lidar and radar and 29 cameras You're just not going\n to hit them.\n invisible laser beams scanning around millions of times a second and then it detects the reflection and how long it takes to come back allows you to determine how far it is to that object. So what it's doing is like painting a\n 3D picture of the world. There are 29 cameras around this vehicle, which gives you full 360 vision, it gives you close range vision, what is right next to the car, and also long range vision, going out five\n meters. This car could detect a stop sign or a pedestrian 500 meters away. How many of us have eyesight that is that good? There is also a microphone up on top to listen to what's happening in the environment and if there\n If there are sirens, then the car will pull over to the side of the road. It's got to be able to respond to emergency vehicles.\n What I want to see here is how does it handle a parking lot where there's, you know, people driving in unusual ways and possibly pedestrians walking around.\n Whoa, that was a sudden stop. The car made a pretty hard stop there. I think it saw that guy with the cart coming up on a pedestrian crosswalk. And one of the interesting things that the vehicle is always\n was doing is not only seeing where things are and where they're going but also making predictions about where they're likely to go. So this car doesn't just have one potential future. It's constantly imagining, well, he might\n at the crosswalk or he might keep going or he might turn left and so it has to be prepared for all of those different options and it even weights the options of like how likely it thinks that he's going to go on the crosswalk versus go straight versus turn and you can see that\n with the thickness of the line in the little simulated graphic that they have. A few years back, I think a lot of people were talking about how autonomous vehicles have to figure out who to hit\n in case of an accident, like do they pick the orphan or the nun? Should the car hit the motorcyclist with a helmet on because his injuries might be less severe? Or should the car hit the motorcyclist who does not have a helmet on because he did not properly protect himself? If cars were programmed to\n the motorcyclist with the helmet, that would mean that in a way it would become safer to ride without a helmet. But the reality is that 99% of accidents aren't like that. Every year around 1.3 million people\n are killed on the roads, almost all of them due to human error. If autonomous cars can reduce these fatalities, then the real moral dilemma is not getting them on the road sooner for fear we haven't worked out exactly how they'll react to extremely unlikely\n unlikely hypothetical scenarios.\n People are speeding, they're under the influence, they're distracted. I mean, these sorts of problems, an autonomous vehicle would not have. You don't get a distracted driver. The ultimate question, right, that everyone wants to know that I want to know is,\n I want to know the answer to is like, as these vehicles stand, are they better than the average human? Not than the best human, but just like an average human, like replacing some random car on the street with one of these vehicles. Does that make the road safer? Yes, it does.\n I think we would never launch a rider only service if we did not meet that base safety framework. If that's true, it means like every vehicle that's not on the road is kind of\n a worse situation, do you know what I mean? We are really working really hard to launch this in larger areas and new areas too, but we need to have the experience to show the regulators why we believe it's safer and for that you need to be driving miles.\n a number of miles that you feel comfortable with, statistically speaking. These vehicles have way more experience than any human driver because they've now accumulated data over 20 million miles of driving on public roads.\n If you were an average driver, you'd have to drive for a thousand years to accumulate that sort of experience. And all of that experience can be used to train the systems, to fix the software, and used across all the vehicles in the fleet.\n In 2019, Waymo released a study of its data over 6.1 million miles of automated driving in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area. Of the 18 total accidents that occurred during the study, none were serious enough to expect significant\n injury or death.\n humans do those things. If you look at the eight significant accidents that happened with Waymo vehicles over the six million miles of driving, all eight of them involve a human driver of another vehicle doing\n something stupid like driving on the wrong side of the road or running a red light or going through a stop sign or failing to yield or going 20 miles per hour over the speed limit. There were three incidents involving Waymo vehicles and pedestrians.\n But in all three, the Waymo vehicle was stationary and the pedestrian or cyclist skateboarder ran into the vehicle. Waymo also takes some of that real world data and\n They put it into simulations and they tweak it a bit. So they try adding like a bicyclist going fast or going slow or they make the car turn faster or slower. So they change all these parameters and variables and they see what the software will do.\n And they've trained the software on an additional 20 billion miles of driving, not on the road, but in simulation. So that's a thousand times more experience again. The question for me is, when is stepping\n inside an autonomous car gonna feel the same as stepping inside an elevator? Because I think that time may be coming sooner than you think. I like the idea of this technology but honestly getting in the car I wasn't quite sure how I would feel it was a little bit\n and\n I think a lot of people miss the bigger implications of what is a\n once fully autonomous driving is commonplace. Riders with disabilities, seniors and the blind can get around more easily. Transportation will get cheaper. Think of all the wasted value in the cars that spend over 95% of their time parked.\n We can regain a bunch of time and feel happier because commuting and being stuck in traffic sucks. We can reduce traffic because vehicles will have better awareness of each other. You can imagine one day when all the cars are fully autonomous,\n they can execute a beautiful ballet driving together. And when that time comes, we can eliminate parking lots and add green spaces to our cities. And most importantly, widespread adoption of autonomous cars could prevent tens of thousands of fatalities in the US alone.\n When do you think that this will be a reality? Clearly it's coming, but when? If you're talking about big cities, I'm hoping the next five years will be really game changing. I'm excited to see it. Me too, believe me. Believe me. I just don't want SuperMu to work anymore.\n I would love to sit in the back seat, do my work, come on the way there and I'm right back. Or do something fun, watch a movie. Or sleep. Yeah.\n you"

            "transcription": "A portion of this video was sponsored by Salesforce.\n and how this sport has continually been reinvented for literally thousands of years up to the present day. This is the science of bowling, the most popular participatory sport in the United States.\n impressive how that went. I'm even more impressed than you are. What is inside a bowling ball? Well, I sent this ball to Creative Electron to get a 3D x-ray scan and this is the result. What is that?\n I always expected bowling balls to be, you know, perfect solid spheres, but there's something inside here. And it's not symmetric, and it's not even centered in the ball. So I went to Storm Bowling, one of only 11 bowling ball manufacturers\n in the world to find out how bowling balls are made.\n about the X, the Y, and the Z axes. The weight blocks are embedded in a core of lightweight glass beads. Oh!\n That is so silky soft. I feel like I have not felt anything this soft. What's the difference in density between this sort of filler material and this core? It's quite a bit. About two and a half to three times more dense in the inner waist.\n block than it is in the core material. If you were to look for example at this actual core, number one it says 960 which means that it weighs 9.60 pounds and then the description here underneath\n which is a 0.3, this indicates what type of a weight block is inside of it. What happens over here? So this area right here is our urethane area. So basically what we have are a number of different tanks that are set up. So there's a chemical reaction\n that occurs once it actually fills the mold and we pour that cover stock material around the core it gets extremely hot in just a matter of minutes. You go right down here she's actually pouring the pin material inside the\n tops of those cores. So you can see for this particular bowling ball, it's a bright orange type of a material and she's actually filling that hole with that plug material. We've got the lathe right here which is where we take the balls that come out of the mold.\n Since the balls are not symmetric, they are heavier on one side than the other.\n You see there the last four or five pumps of air where it actually floats the air, then it stops and pauses, that the ball has completely settled. And then basically a needle will come out from the bottom part and all of a sudden it'll shoot up and then it'll be where the center of gravity is on the surface of the ball.\n When it comes right off the lathe right here, it is extremely porous and very very dull and there is a ton of friction between the ball and the lane at this point. So every ball from right here will be smoothed up. It's just a matter of how much it's\n going to be smoothed up in order to get what is the desired finish. But before they can use these balls they have to be drilled but that is specific to each bowler. How many balls are you making a day?\n We're making over 3,000 balls in a day now that come out of this plant right here. This is wild.\n I found the bowling ball equivalent of clickbait. You won't believe your eyes. The mind-bending hook. Right? Yeah. That's how you have to sell your stuff. Exactly, yeah. But how did it come to be this way?\n Bowling seems to be an ancient game. Archaeologists have found wall drawings of a sport that looks like bowling in an ancient Egyptian tomb dating back 7,000 years. In Germany, bowling was used as a religious ritual.\n represented your sins, so you're a good Christian if you could knock them all down. Martin Luther himself was apparently a bowling fanatic and fixed the number of pins at nine. When the game made its way over to America, nine-pin bowling was banned because it promoted gambling.\n The legend goes that people cleverly came up with 10-pin bowling to get around the law. Whoa, totally different game. Today in the US, 9-pin bowling is only played in Texas because it was the one state that didn't ban it, instead charging a tax.\n Bowling lanes are about 3.5 feet wide and 60 feet long down to the head pin. I'm using imperial units here because that's actually how they're defined. The lane is made of 39 narrow boards that bowlers number for\n reference. They used to be made of maple and pinewood, but these days most lanes are synthetic and made of fine particles coated with melamine resin. One game of bowling gives you 10 frames with two throws per frame to try to knock down all 10 pins.\n The highest score you can get in a game without a strike is only 190. But strikes allow you to double count your next two throws, so a perfect game with all strikes gives you a score of 300. If you're anything like me, the whole game\n is just trying to throw the ball as straight as you can down the middle of the lane, hit the head pin and try to take as many other pins down with it as possible. Do you want to give me any tips or? I've watched LeBron boy. You won't be worse than him. You say that now.\n See that's what I would normally do and I would normally be like reasonably happy with a shot like that. But for pro bowlers like Pete Webber or Chris Barnes, the game is different and not just because they are way\n better than me. Hitting the headpin square on is not the perfect strategy. If you hit the headpin\n pin square on going straight, you're unlikely to knock down all the pins. You could end up with a split where the ball goes through the middle or with the ball deflecting off to one side after hitting the head pin. Chances for a strike are much higher if the center of the ball hits the pins\n just to one side of the head pin, board 17 and a half, in which case the ball takes out the 1, 3, 5, and 9 pins, which take out the others. So we want the ball to hit the one pin, the three, the pin behind the one, which is\n the five pin and then the nine or the eight and the nine. You want the ball to hit all of those pins? Yeah. Now the pins don't always fall this way, but the pin shape helps. Pins roll in circles like eggs, which help knock down the others.\n But to have an over 90% chance of getting a strike, the center of the ball has to hit with an error smaller than half a board.\n to say throwing a ball 60 feet straight at a target smaller than a dime is a tough task, especially to do it consistently. Luckily, there is a better way. Now if we look at the pins and as you look at them from here, from straight on,\n If you can hit the pins\n not head-on, but at an angle of 6 degrees, you dramatically increase your chances of knocking them all down. Now the margin for error is greater. The ball can be coming in anywhere from board 17 to 18 and a half.\n that is a board and a half of room and that still gives you greater than a 90% chance of a strike. Now six degrees may not sound like a lot, but it's actually extremely difficult to hit. The problem is if you wanted to throw the ball straight at the pins and hit them at\n six degrees you would have to be bowling from three-quarters over on the next lane and that is impossible what with the two gutters in between and all so the solution is you've got to curve the ball on one lane I feel like I have\n This really became a big part of the sport by accident.\n wood gets beat up with the damage from all the balls going into it and so they basically created slip agents, lubricants, much like oil in a car so that the lanes didn't get damaged so quickly. So the original idea was to protect the wood? The original idea was just to protect the\n surface of the lane it was not to manufacture anything from a competitive scoring type environment. But applying oil to protect the wood meant that balls no longer gripped the lane and rolled without slipping down to the pins. Instead they could skid, rotate\n including not in their direction of travel. Now, I've been to a lot of bowling alleys before making this video, and I noticed it was a bit greasy, but I always thought that was just the nature of bowling alleys, like the stinky rental shoes.\n I didn't know they intentionally put oil on the lanes. Vox has a great video specifically about oil patterns. These days there are machines specifically for applying oil to the lanes. And then as a precaution.\n Well, yeah, it does make the ball skid. Well, if I put more in the middle than the outside, well, my bowlers bowl a little bit better and they're happier. And then as technology advances, like everything does, now we have 30,000-dollar lane machines that can put a specific amount of oil on each board. They work.\n Kind of like dot matrix printers, they can lay the oil on with varying degrees of thickness across the lane and extend the oil pattern different distances. There are hundreds of different patterns that can be used. Usually the oil extends about two thirds the way to\n down the lane, so to around 40 or 45 feet. But there's always a dry patch of wood before the pins that increases the friction with the ball, getting it to start rolling without slipping. And this leads to the three parts of any pro bowler's throw.\n the skid, the hook, and the roll. When a bowler releases the ball, it can be going 20 miles an hour and spinning at 500 rpm. That's nearly 10 full revolutions per second.\n Right-handers typically throw the ball to the right on the lane while spinning it to the left. During the skid phase, the ball slides down the lane, spinning but not rolling. As it comes to the end of the oil, the friction increases and the ball accelerates to the left.\n It hooks because of its spin, and the spin starts lining up with the direction of travel leading to stage 3, roll. The ball is rolling without slipping as it barrels into the pins, ideally as close to that 6 degree angle as possible.\n Like the ball starts on the left side of the lane, goes straight across almost rightmost, then hooks like at the last minute, rolls in there. So that's almost like a perfect shot, right?\n Like straight in the pocket there? Yeah, that's where you want to hit the pins, yeah. My very first game, it was ABC back then, American Bulling Congress.\n I filled out the application to bowl in Men's League. Dad gave him the letter saying that I could. And the first game of bowl was $300. And they handed me $100 too. They were like, yeah, making money now. Actually, my first, my sixth,\n My ninth, my thirteenth, seventeenth, twentieth, we're all 300 games. I had like seven or eight 300s in my first year of Men's League. How do you explain that? To shoot 300, you have to get lucky somewhere along the line.\n Like that. Like that. It came in and hit the 1-3-5-9. And that's what we call the perfect shot.\n I mean you just keep hitting him. That's almost the identical shot. Look at that. That yellow and the purple, they're almost exactly on top of each other. That one just goes a little little stray.\n That one, the purple one, was just a little bit higher on the head pin, but it still hit the one, three, and the five, and the nine. Can't get much better. This type of throw is only possible because of the oil.\n If you try to throw a ball the same way on an unoiled lane, it just doesn't work.\n normal shot would look like if there was no oil. No oil, it's going to hit the lane and go in the left gutter. That's what I want to see. All right. You're going to throw it just like it's a regular lane. Yeah. All right.\n Well, yeah, there's no oil on the lane, so the ball can't get down. As soon as it hits the lane, it's going to start hooking. You know, because if you do this, who's going to want to bowl on us? So they want the oil. Yeah, we need the oil.\n If we didn't have oil, this is what it would be and nobody'd have fun. This is not fun. The bowling sucks. We don't want to do this. For pro bowlers, the oil on the lane is a key part of the game.\n Wow, hey, do you like look at the oil? Are you trying to scope it out? Or you just kind of guessing? I usually don't look at the oil. I let my ball be the guide. You know, I know some guys that are, you know, they get down like this.\n Whether you can see it or not, figuring out the condition of oil on the lane can make the difference between a strike and\n a miss. As the game wears on, the bowling balls move the oil around, pushing it further down the lane and stripping it off the most common paths. So players have to adjust to the\n changing conditions. Some people say left-handers have an advantage because, well, right-handers aren't playing on their side of the lane. At most bowling alleys, they use a pattern of oil that is thicker in the middle and thinner out toward the edges. This is a forgive\n giving layout because balls that drift too far out start to hook earlier, while balls going straighter can continue down the lane for longer before making their turn into the pins. But for pro bowlers, the oil conditions vary, and players have to adjust their games\n to the conditions.\n Not the same condition every week. We have cheetah, chameleon, scorpion, shark, one more in there. Bear? Bear, yeah. But it's not just the oil on the lanes that has transformed bowling. It's also the balls themselves.\n Hard rubber bowling balls was what I started with maybe mid 70s and then the yellow dot the Columbia yellow dot which is a plastic ball and then they came out with urethane bowling balls I won a lot of titles with the urethane stuff and then they come out with the\n Reactive resin is just a modified polyurethane with a more porous surface which gives it more grip in the oil. It's the most popular surface or cover stock for bowling balls today. Balls started out as perfect\n symmetrically weighted spheres. And when you go to a bowling alley, the house balls there are still just that. But when you drill holes in the ball, you take some weight out of one side. So to rebalance it, ball manufacturers added a small pancake weight on the same side.\n as the holes. But then ball manufacturers got the idea they could add different weights inside the ball to improve their performance. You can have two balls that look identical from the outside, weigh exactly the same amount, and yet roll differently.\n If the mass is more concentrated around the axis of rotation, say you have a dense cylinder inside the ball, well then it has a lower moment of inertia. This means for the same amount of energy input, it will spin faster. In bowling, they prefer to talk\n about an analogous concept, radius of gyration, or RG. If you were to concentrate the entire mass of the ball onto a hoop with the same moment of inertia, its radius would be the radius of gyration. So smaller radius of gyration\n Rotation just means lower moment of inertia, which translates into more rotation that a bowler can get on the ball.\n It's like 8% for every .05. And so depending on what your reverie rate is, it can be fairly significant. An ability to spin the balls faster gives a bowler the ability to hook the ball more sharply further down the lane.\n giving them a better chance of achieving that 6 degree entry angle. What was amazing for me to learn is that the weight blocks in these balls aren't even centered. There's a heavy side and a lighter side on purpose, and you can find and mark this side by\n letting the ball spin freely on a cushion of air until it comes to rest heavy side down. They showed me a great demonstration of how the position of the center of gravity can affect the movement of the ball. When the center of mass is on the left side of the ball it pulls\n in the same direction as the spin, helping the ball hook to the left into the pins. Same exact ball, same numbers, just different, static and balanced basically. But here is a flipped bowling ball where the center of mass is on\n the right. Now the ball starts to hook into the left, but at the end something weird happens. The center of mass pulls it over to the right. This effect is only really noticeable when the ball is thrown slowly.\n These days there are tons of different weight blocks that go inside bowling balls and they can be grouped into two categories, symmetric and asymmetric. For all these weight blocks, the minimum moment of inertia, or in bowling terms the\n smallest RG axis is identified by a pin, which is visible on the outside of the ball. It will spin most easily about this axis. For the symmetric weight blocks, the ball doesn't change as you rotate it about this axis, so the maximum\n moment of inertia is rotating about any axis that passes through the equator of the ball. I certainly didn't expect bowling balls to have asymmetric cores, but it turns out what look like perfect spheres actually have three different principal\n sees\n We're going to put it on the Determinator and show how it actually will spin it and find it, no matter how we position it on there. So you spin them up on this machine until they settle into the way they like to spin, what the bowlers call their preferred spin axis, or PSA.\n But why would you want a ball to be an asymmetric top? Well, professional bowlers drill their balls so that at launch, the axis of rotation is somewhere between the minimum and maximum moment of inertia. And as a result, as the ball goes\n goes down the lane spinning, it precesses like a gyroscope. The axis of rotation rotates around, causing the point of contact between the ball and the lane to change. This precession means that different parts of the ball contact the\n And you can see this when the ball comes back by the spread out lines of oil on the ball's surface. Bowlers call this track flare, and it's desirable because it means once the ball hits the un-oiled part of the lane, it gets traction faster and hooks more dramatically back to the ball.\n pins. This is what asymmetric cores are used for. They have larger differences between their moments of inertia in different axes, or what bowlers call RG differential, which makes the ball process. If you spin a ball around its minimum or\n maximum moment of inertia, it processes less and there's much less flare, meaning oil builds up on one part of the ball. This reduces the friction over the dry part of the lane so the ball hooks less.\n But how important are each of these factors in actually getting the best shot? Well the US bowling\n Congress, or USBC, the governing body that sets all rules and regulations for US bowling, they did a landmark study in 2008 trying to tease out the most significant factors that affect ball motion. In order to determine the impact of each factor,\n had to make sure the throws were identical. So they turned to Harry, at the time the most consistent bowler in the world. He is a robot. Bowling robots are designed to be able to throw hundreds of identical shots. In fact,\n In fact, the robot Earl, Harry's successor in 2011, actually lost to Chris Barnes when he debuted, in part because his throws were so consistent. He wore away the oil in a single part of the lane, so his shots hooked too much.\n The people managing him did their best to adjust to the oil conditions, but few people are Chris Barnes. The USBC Ball Motion Study used Harry to throw thousands of shots with different bowling balls, and they found that the center of gravity affected the ball\n motion relatively little, around the same level as environmental factors like room temperature or humidity. RG and RG differential, essentially the moment of inertia and difference between maximum and minimum moments of inertia, that affected the\n ball motion significantly more. But the factor that affected ball motion the most was the surface of the ball. The top five individual factors were the amplitude of surface roughness, meaning the height of microscopic spikes on the ball,\n the coefficient of friction with an oiled lane, the surface roughness by spacing, that is the distance between microscopic spikes, the coefficient of friction with a dry lane, and how quickly the ball surface absorbs oil.\n Bowlers recognize just how important the surface of their ball is. They pay close attention to what it's made of and how it's finished. Rougher finishes give the ball more traction in the oil and get it to start hooking earlier. This is useful for long oil patterns and slow\n axis rotation. These two shots are thrown identically. The only difference\n is the ball on the left has a rougher surface. Rough surfaces act like winter tires, helping to dig into the oil and give the ball traction. They also act as badly as winter tires on a\n You can get many different levels of smoothness up to a near mirror shine. This is better for\n for short oil patterns to prevent the ball hooking too much too early. Ultimately, pro bowlers carry many different balls to each competition. I'm not afraid to change balls in the middle of a game. If I go to a game and I've got like eight spare, eight spare, eight spare,\n All right, it's time to change balls. So now I gotta find the right ball to get down the lane again and find the pocket, which usually I have a pretty good idea. So they select their ball a little like a golfer selects their club to suit the conditions.\n But does all this tech actually make people better bowlers? Well, over the last 20 years, average scores have increased by more than 5 points. Plus, the number of perfect 300 games bowled per year per 1,000 bowlers has increased dramatically since then.\n the 1980s. This graph shows the percent change year over year. In 1976, soaker balls, balls chemically softened to absorb oil and hook more, were banned, and there was a dip in perfect games. But the same year\n In the year, a new rubber ball was introduced, the Brunswick LT48, and more .300s were hit in the years that followed. In 1991, reactive resin balls were introduced and there was another significant jump. Now obviously there were other improvements in equipment,\n equipment and natural variability, but some of the big changes do correlate with the introduction of new ball technology. So yes, the wild bowling ball technologies out there, especially anything to do with surface, significantly affect ball motion\n and your bowling game. But ball motion is likely minutely affected by hundreds of other factors. Even the color of the ball can have a small impact. A USBC study in 2016 found that different pigments absorb oil at different rates.\n Bowling is the sport of reinvention. It goes back to ancient Egypt, but has transformed many times. Now when you get up to throw a single shot, you have to think about the oil pattern on the lane, the stage of the game and how the pattern has shifted,\n the weight block in your ball, whether you want symmetric or asymmetric, which axis you'll spin it about to affect precession, where the center of mass is to pull the ball to the left or the right, where the cover stock is made of, and whether it's rough or smooth, all to make a shot that's\n skids, hooks, and rolls to the pins between boards 17 and 18 and a half at as close to a 6 degree angle as you can muster. Now do that again 12 times in a row and you have a perfect game.\n Hey, this portion of the video was sponsored by Salesforce.

            "transcription": "This is a video about things like cars, phones, and light bulbs and an actual conspiracy that made them worse. This video was sponsored by NordVPN, more about\n them at the end of the video. I am outside Livermore Fire Station number 6 and in here they have the longest continuously on light bulb in the world. It has been on for a hundred and twenty years.\n It's not even connected to a light switch, but it does have a backup battery and generator. So the big question is, how has this light bulb lasted so long? It was manufactured by hand\n And not long after commercial light bulbs were first invented. And yet, it has been running for over a million hours, way longer than any light bulb today is meant to last. A while back, a friend of mine told me this story, that someone had invented\n lightbulb that would last forever, years ago. But they never sold it because an everlasting lightbulb makes for a terrible business model. I mean, you would never have any repeat customers and eventually you would run out of people to sell lightbulbs to. I thought this\n This story sounded ridiculous. If you could make an everlasting lightbulb, then everyone would buy your lightbulb over the competitors. And so you could charge really high prices, make a lot of money, even if demand would eventually dry up. I just couldn't imagine that we had better\n light bulbs in the past and then intentionally made them worse. But it turns out I was wrong. At least, sort of. Inventing a viable electric light was hard. I mean, this is the typical incandescent design\n which just involves passing electric current through a material making it so hot that it glows. You know, less than 5% of the electrical energy comes out as light. The other 95% is released as heat. So these are really heat bulbs\n which give off a little bit of light as a byproduct. You know the temperature of the filament can get up to 2800 Kelvin. That is half as hot as the surface of the sun. At temperatures like those most materials melt and if they don't\n They burn. Which is why in the 1840s Warren Delarue came up with the idea of putting the filament in a vacuum bulb so there's no oxygen to react with. By 1879 Thomas Edison had made a bulb with a cotton\n thread filament that lasted 14 hours. Other inventors created bulbs with platinum filaments or other carbonized materials and gradually the lifespan of bulbs increased. The filaments changed from carbon to tungsten\n Houston, which has a very high melting point, and by the early 1920s average bulb lifetimes were approaching 2,000 hours, with some lasting 2,500 hours. But this is when lifetimes stopped getting longer and started\n getting shorter. In Geneva, Switzerland, just before Christmas 1924, there was a secret meeting of top executives from the world's leading light bulb companies. Philips, International General Electric, Tokyo Electric, Osram,\n from Germany and the UK's Associated Electric, among others. They formed what became known as the Phoebus Cartel, named after Phoebus, the Greek god of light. There, all these companies agreed to work together\n to help each other by controlling the world's supply of light bulbs. In the early days of the electrical industry, there had been lots of different small light bulb manufacturers, but by now, they had largely been consolidated into the\n these big corporations, each dominant in a particular part of the world. The biggest threat they all faced was from longer lasting light bulbs. For example, in 1923, Osram sold 63 million light bulbs, but the following year they\n sold only 28 million. Light bulbs were lasting too long, eating into sales. So all the companies in the cartel agreed to reduce the lifespan of their bulbs to 1,000 hours, cutting the existing average almost\n But how could each company ensure that the other companies would actually follow the rules and make shorter lasting light bulbs? After all, it would be in each of their individual interests to make a better product to outsell the others.\n Well, to enforce the thousand-hour limit, each of the manufacturers had to send in sample bulbs from their factories, and they were tested on big test stands like this one. If a bulb lasted significantly longer than a thousand hours,\n Well then the company was fined. If a bulb lasted longer than 3,000 hours, well the fine was 200 Swiss francs for every thousand bulbs sold. And there are records of these fines being issued to companies.\n But how do you make a worse light bulb in the first place? Well, the same engineers who had previously been tasked with extending the lifespan now had to find ways to decrease it. So they tried different materials, different shaped filaments and thinner connections\n And if you look at the data, they were successful. Ever since the formation of the cartel, the lifespan of light bulbs steadily decreased, so that by 1934 the average lifespan was just 1205 hours. And just as\n they had planned, sales increased for cartel members by 25% in the four years after 1926. And even though the cost of components came down, the cartel kept prices virtually unchanged, so they increased their profit\n So did people know that the light bulb companies were conspiring together to make their products worse? No. The Phoebus cartel claimed that its purpose was to increase standardization and efficiency of light bulbs.\n I mean they did establish this screw thread as standard, you can find it on virtually all light bulbs around the world now. But all evidence points to the cartels being motivated by profits and increased sales, not by what was best for consumers.\n So one of the reasons this light bulb has lasted so long is because it was made before the cartel era. Another reason is because the filament has always been run at low power, just four or five watts. It was meant to be a nightlight for the fire station.\n to provide just enough light so that firemen wouldn't run into things at night. And the fact that it was always on reduced the thermal cycling of the filament and components, limiting the stress caused by thermal expansion and contraction.\n The deepest cartel was initially planned to last at least until 1955, but it fell apart in the 1930s. It was already struggling due to outside competition and non-compliance amongst some of its members, but the outbreak of World War II is\n really what finished it off. So this cartel was dead, but its methods survived to this day. There are lots of companies out there that intentionally shorten the lifespan of their products. It's a tactic known now as\n planned obsolescence.\n I have an iPod that I bought about 18 months ago and the battery is dead on it. 18 months? Okay, it's passed this year which basically means there will be a charge of $255 plus a mailing fee to send it to us to refurbish it.\n This video got millions of views in a time before YouTube or social media and it spawned a class action lawsuit which Apple settled out of\n court. But it didn't stop the company from practicing planned obsolescence. After an iOS update in 2017, users of older iPhones found apps loading significantly slower or the device shutting down altogether. Apple said they\n fraudulent performance to protect the battery of older devices and increase their longevity. Of course, that wouldn't be an issue if the battery were replaceable. In a series of lawsuits that concluded in 2020, Apple was fined or reached settlements to\n pay hundreds of millions of dollars. Undoubtedly, this amount pales in comparison to the extra revenue they generate by limiting the lifespan of their products. But some would argue that planned obsolescence isn't just about\n greed, but that it's also good for everyone. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, when as much as a quarter of Americans were out of work, an American real estate broker Bernard London proposed mandatory planned obsolescence\n as a way to get people back to work and lift America out of the depression. He wrote,\n known by the consumer. After the allotted time had expired, these things would be legally dead and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment. Now this might sound\n It sounded like a wild, fringe idea, but people were clearly afraid of being put out of work by technological progress and products that were too good. There was even a popular Oscar-nominated film about it. This is The Man in the White Suit.\n from 1951. It's about a scientist who invents the perfect fiber. It won't stain or break or fray. I think I've succeeded in the copolymerization of amino acid residues and carbohydrate molecules, both containing ionic groups.\n It's really perfectly simple. The Academy Award nomination was for best screenplay. I kid you not. Anyway, everyone is initially excited about our hero's scientific discovery. He makes a suit out of the\n And it has to be white because the fiber is so stain resistant it can't even be dyed But this is when trouble strikes the factory owners Realized they won't be able to sell as much of this thread because it's so durable and the workers worry it'll put them out of a job\n job. This is when you get the climactic scene where factory workers and factory owners\n team up to chase down the scientist to destroy him and his invention. And believe it or not, this movie may have been inspired by real events. In the 1940s, the synthetic fiber nylon replaced silk in stockings.\n And it was so durable that the products became an overnight sensation. There were literal riots when women tried to get their hands on them. When the manufacturers realized they had made the product too good, they didn't destroy the fiber, but they did\n They followed the example of the Phoebus cartel. They instructed their engineers and scientists to find ways to weaken the product, to shorten its lifespan so people would have to buy more. Now, it seems like consumers are finally fighting back against planned obsolescence.\n In the European Union and in over 25 states in the US, there's proposed legislation to enshrine the right to repair. These laws would force manufacturers to make it easier to repair their products. They would have to provide information and access to information.\n access to parts, so you could replace a battery or fix a cracked screen at a third-party repair shop without voiding your warranty. So if the right to repair does become law, does that mean artificial obsolescence will be gone for good? Sadly, no.\n Because there is one last thing manufacturers can use to make their products obsolete, which is you. Henry Ford released the first mass-market car, the Model T, in 1908 and he envisioned it like a\n workhorse, an affordable tool that wouldn't wear out, a bit like the everlasting light bulb. In 1922, Ford said, we want the man who buys one of our cars never to have to buy another. We never make an improvement that renders any previous model obsolete.\n But by 1920, 55% of American families already owned a car. Nearly everyone that could afford one had one. In that same year, there was a small economic downturn driving down sales for both Ford and\n General Motors. In 1921, DuPont, the chemical and paint company, took over the controlling share in General Motors. And they started experimenting with painting cars different colors. Up until then, Henry Ford had said, you could\n have whatever color you like, so long as it's black. It took a couple years of testing, but in 1924, GM released their first cars in different colors, and soon after, they introduced a trick that feels very familiar\n now. Each new year, they would introduce cars in different colors. The goal wasn't just to make Ford's Model T look outdated, but to make their own cars feel outdated every year, encouraging customers to trade in their old\n cars for shiny new ones. Years later, GM's head of design Harley Earl candidly discussed his role in creating what he called dynamic obsolescence. Our big job is to hasten obsolescence. In 1934, the average car ownership\n By the time he said this, General Motors was the most valuable company in the world, and it sold\n half of all vehicles purchased in the US every year. These days the world's most valuable company, Apple, seems to have copied directly out of this playbook. I mean new styles every year? Check.\n Check. New special colors every year? Check. Marginal technological improvement? Check. I mean, is this useful innovation or just a gimmick? The inspiration for General Motors, and hence for Apple, comes from fashion.\n real innovation is all but impossible. So the only way to make people feel the urgency to get out there and buy is to create styles that last but one season. The trouble then is you run through these styles too quickly and then what are you supposed\n to do. We'll just recycle the styles from a few decades ago. The iPhone also shows this recycling trend. I mean just look at the way the edges were initially rounded and then they were squared off and then they were rounded again and\n And now they're squared off. And how much do you want to bet that the iPhone 14 has rounded edges? I think the point is that with design and styling, there is no best. There's only different. Which is apparently enough to remind us that we don't have the latest and greatest\n and so we have to rush out and keep buying. The only type of obsolescence we should support is technological, which brings us back to the light bulb. You know, in the last 20 years, light bulbs have gone from incandescent\n which was basically unchanged for a hundred years, to compact fluorescent and now to LED. These use just a tenth the energy and can last anywhere from 10 to 50 times longer. Yeah, that's pretty bright.\n So you're more likely to sell your house than to have to replace an LED bulb that you've installed inside it. So we finally reached the point of what is essentially an everlasting light bulb.\n Hey, this video was sponsored by NordVPN. You know, I am featured in an episode of the British TV program, QI.

            "transcription": "Push this button. It's driving itself. It feels good. So BMW brought me to the Consumer Electronics Show here in Las Vegas. I'm gonna check out the future\n of driving. In this concept car, there's a holographic menu screen. It works by projecting\n an image above this panel and then it uses this camera here in the steering column to determine where your finger is and when it detects your fingers in the right spot it uses ultrasound from these speakers to provide haptic feedback you can actually feel it in your finger it's\n It's like a little buzzing. But what I really want to try is not driving. I can actually talk to the camera. Are you sure that this is a good idea? So here's a question. How much should you trust an autonomous car? This car is\n now driving itself, but I need to be ready to take over at any time. I'm still legally responsible if something happens to the car, right? But in the coming years, cars are going to take over more and more of the responsibility for driving safe.\n safely. And that has led a lot of people to consider the moral dilemmas faced when programming self-driving cars.\n into an SUV or swerve right into a motorcycle. Okay, so we can imagine a lot of weird situations where an autonomous car has to make a tough choice. But the real moral dilemma is accidents are happening right now. More than\n 30,000 people are killed each year in the US alone and more than 2 million are injured and the problem in 94% of collisions is driver error. In 2015 half of all traffic fatalities occurred on highways so\n Even this level of technology we've demonstrated today, autonomous driving on a highway, could save a lot of lives. We are already shirking our responsibility for driving cars. We're using our phones. In 2014, distracted driving\n resulted in at least 3,000 killed and 430,000 injured.\n Elevators became autonomous. A lot of people were uncomfortable with that. They were used to there being a driver in the elevator, so compromises had to be made, like big red stop buttons just to make people comfortable and a nice soothing voice.\n to say which floor would you like to go to? Now I know that elevators have many fewer degrees of freedom than a car, but even if you look at something like airplanes, airplanes flying in full autonomous mode are actually safer, studies show.\n than when pilots can take control. I think the moral dilemmas over exactly how cars should react in the tiny percentage of cases where tough choices need to be made is a distraction from the main problem. The longer we wait to get autonomous vehicles on the road,\n the more people will die. And that is the real moral question of autonomous cars. Why aren't we getting them on the road faster? I hope you enjoyed the ride. That was cool. Now let's head back for the CES. Perfect.\n you"

            "transcription": "Can I tell you something I'm bad at? I am terrible at making clickbait. Up until two years ago, my most popular video was about a basketball being dropped from a dam with a bit of backspin. It takes off like a rocket and shoots out way further\n than you'd expect. This video was embedded on literally hundreds of news websites, and in its first week it got 16.3 million views, but almost none of those views came on the YouTube platform. Why?\n because I gave it this thumbnail and I called it Strange Applications of the Magnus Effect. This video is sponsored by KiwiCo. More about them at the end of the show. Now I believe within YouTube I'm used as an example of\n how not to package your video. As if to demonstrate just how bad a title and thumbnail this is, someone else re-uploaded the video with the clever title, Basketball Dropped From Dam. And within a few weeks, that video had received tens of millions of views on\n on YouTube. This is when YouTube gave me access to Content ID, the system that allows you to earn revenue when someone else reuploads your videos. Which was good, but I still wasn't very good at clickbait. So for this video, I called in an expert.\n I wanted to see your reaction face. Can you give me like a reaction face? Like what's a good thumbnail face? Oh, I got you. This is a thumbnail face. I have like 10 I go through the motions of like.\n When I started on this platform some 10 years ago, clickbait was less important. Subscribers were what mattered.\n because most of the views came from the sub feed and videos went viral usually by getting a lot of attention elsewhere like on reddit or Facebook not due to the YouTube algorithm but once you had a big video and people subscribed well then your next video would likely get a lot of views\n from those subscribers. So YouTube would take that popular video and share it with more people and so you'd get more subscribers in a positive feedback loop. But soon YouTube realized that this did not create the best experience for the viewer. They discovered that\n that showing people only videos from channels they were subscribed to led to fewer clicks, less watch time, and less engagement with the site as a whole. Plus, they knew that relying on other platforms to drive traffic to viral hits was risky, since those other platforms\n might disable the traffic at any time. So they needed to make YouTube a destination in itself. They wanted people to come to YouTube, see videos that interested them, click on at least one of them, and watch it for a while. Ideally get sucked down the YouTube rabbit hole\n whole\n importance of subscribers, make it less like a podcast app where you only get the shows you're subscribed to, and more like Reddit where stuff with the most engagement rises to the top. But that necessarily meant increasing the importance of clickbait.\n Now there seems to be a paradox when it comes to clickbait, people almost universally claim to hate it, but you also see it everywhere, so why is this? Well one of the problems is we don't all agree on the definition of clickbait, when a Google\n To call it, the top definition is, on the internet, content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular webpage. We could call this type one clickbait, and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it.\n If you didn't try to attract attention and get people to click on your links, then you wouldn't really be doing your job. But there is a second definition, one that I think more people ascribe to, which is something such as a headline designed to make readers want to click on a hyperlink,\n especially when the link leads to content of dubious value or interest. Wikipedia says a defining characteristic of clickbait is that it is sensationalized or misleading, and it also talks about teasers that intentionally withhold information to exploit the curiosity\n gap. They give you enough information to make you curious, but not enough to satisfy that curiosity. Here are two actual titles from a news website. 9 out of 10 Americans are completely wrong about this mind-blowing fact.\n and someone gave some kids some scissors, here's what happened next. I think we can all agree that these are examples of bad type 2 clickbait. Now imagine a clickbait space where on one axis you have how misleading or sensationalizing\n it is and on the other how much information is intentionally withheld to create a curiosity gap. Well then these two titles fall in the top right corner and these are the zones of type 2 clickbait. At the other extreme you have things that are so\n unsensationalized as to be dull. You could call this the dead zone. Now here is where you would find strange applications of the Magnus effect. I mean I didn't tell you what the applications were. Now in the middle is where\n where you would find type 1 clickbait. But honestly, I think type 1 and type 2 clickbait are so different that we shouldn't even use the same word for them. Instead of type 1 clickbait, my friend and YouTuber Brady Herron suggested legitbait. I mean,\n It might sound enticing, but it is legit. Instead of type 2 clickbait, we could use click trap, click trick, link trap, or dupe shoot. What's important to recognize is that for any given video, there is no\n One true title and thumbnail. Each video could have hundreds or thousands of different, legit bait titles. For example, how does a zero G plane work? I went on a plane that does parabolic trajectories. What happens to fire?\n on a zero-g plane. Now the most enticing titles and thumbnails are found close to type 2 clickbait. I'm reminded of the infographic by Smarter Every Day showing that on social media, the greatest engagement occurs close to the boundary of what's allowable.\n But remember that everyone's definition of clickbait is different and everyone's perceptions of words and images are different. So these are not clear boundaries, they're actually kind of fuzzy. What for one person might be a legit bait, for someone else could be a click trap.\n What's clear is that on a site where click-through rate is important clickbait of all types is inevitable How important to a video success is the title and thumbnail? Very important, of course, if they don't click on the video, they don't watch it. You can't get 10\n So why is clickbait everywhere? Well, because it works. More enticing thumbnails get more clicks,\n Despite some people's claims that they won't click or they'll unsub, it's just like evolution. Whatever survives multiplies and traits become amplified. If you don't begrudge the giraffe its long neck so it can reach the highest leaves, can you begrudge a YouTuber\n the big red arrow that allows them to reach further audiences? I talked about this in my video two years ago. To be successful as a YouTuber you need to optimize two things. Watch time and the click-through rate of your videos. That's the number of times the title and thumbnail are clicked divided\n it by the total number of times they're shown. At the time, this was something of a revelation for me, because I always thought my job was to make great videos, and then a title and thumbnail that adequately represented what the video was about. But now I've realized that\n that making the title and thumbnail is at least half the job. This is not just because better titles and thumbnails get you more clicks, but because better titles and thumbnails will get you way more impressions. YouTube has limited real estate with which\n to\n you more impressions. Now the big development since my last video on this is YouTube introduced real-time metrics like views impressions and click-through rate and I suggested this would create an arms race. So what you can bet will happen is that creators will\n launch a video and then they'll be sitting there with all these different variants of thumbnails and they'll be swapping them out and looking at what that does to click-through rate and then going with the one that leads to the greatest click-through rate. And this is basically what has happened.\n Let me give you my favorite example. Last year I made a video about asteroids, which I thought was really good. I called it, and people were very positive about the video. They thought it was made\n be one of my best. But the performance was well below average. In its first day, Asteroids was ranked 9th out of my previous 10 videos. It was probably on target for about 1.5 million views. So I tried different titles and\n thumbnails like asteroid impact what are our chances or asteroid impact what could we do but none of these changes got much traction and then on day three after lunch I changed the title and thumbnail to these are the asteroids to worry\n about. And immediately, the video started doing better. It quickly shot up from almost my worst performing video to my best. It now has 14 million views. Nothing about the video changed, just that one\n image and 38 characters. But because of that, the video has reached nearly 10 times as many people as it otherwise would have. And the title and thumbnail accurately describe what the video is about. Sure, there's a curiosity gap, but you couldn't explain\n the whole concept in the length of the title. So if you see a YouTuber changing titles and thumbnails, this is why. Because that effort can be rewarded many times over. I've seen people objecting to this practice because they think the creator is trying to dupe their audience,\n them to click on the same video more than once, but that's not it. The whole point is to get YouTube to show the title and thumbnail to more people. We're trying to increase the number of impressions, which is heavily dependent on the click-through rate. Now a lot of my recent videos\n have this typical view curve. There's an initial spike after I release the video and then a dip and then a second bump after I have figured out a better title and thumbnail. I changed the title and thumbnail and I watched the real-time view graph. What I'm looking for\n for\n knows exactly which thumbnail will work best beforehand.\n The thing is, you don't really know. I mean, you could know if you just were an almighty being that could just predict what people would be interested in. But us, you know, usually, like, if you do hide and seek, you don't really know if, like, you hiding in a tree and then someone walks you below\n use a good thumbnail or if you hiding a trash can in the parking front so you know just do both and then see which one interests people a little bit more I feel the same way but I do feel like you have a better sense of this than like most people of course no one gets 40 million views\n video. But what is the point in getting more views? If you're cynical you might say it's all about money and fame and while there are certainly financial incentives to getting more views that's not why I do it. As an educational\n As a YouTuber, I think there are two very good reasons for using excellent type 1 clickbait over more straightforward packaging. To understand the first reason, let's consider two different possible titles for my most recent video. I called it the simplest math problem no one\n can solve. But it's a video about the Kolat's conjecture, so perhaps a more straightforward title would have been simply to call it that. The problem is, if I publish a video called the Kolat's conjecture, the most likely people to click on it are those who already know\n know what the Collatz conjecture is, and the vast majority of people will never have heard of it. So for them, the title is meaningless, and only the very curious or those who really like Veritasium would click. In contrast, calling it the simplest math problem no one\n solve conveys more information about the video to everyone. This means more people can click on it, most of whom will never have heard of the call-outs conjecture, so I get to teach them something new. And since the video has a higher click-through rate, YouTube shows it to even\n more people, so if my aim is to increase the level of knowledge in the world by the maximum amount possible, this is the way to do it. The second reason we need to optimize titles and thumbnails is to support the major goal of this channel\n we are trying to make the best science films on every topic we tackle. That means traveling to meet experts and film experiments, hiring people to build props, make spectacular animations, research and fact check, we hire expert\n consultants to double and triple check our work. I don't want to make vlogs, I want to make science documentaries on YouTube that put broadcasts to shame. And to make this possible and sustainable, the videos have to get views, and lots of them. And to do that, we have to make\n the best titles and thumbnails we can. YouTuber and Patreon CEO Jack Conte has talked about adjusting your packaging. The idea is know what you're passionate about, what you won't compromise on, and that stuff goes in the box. All the rest, like would\n paper it's wrapped in, that's the packaging. So the video is my focus, and the title and thumbnail are the packaging that I'm happy to adjust so I can make the type of videos that are important to me. Now is it ironic that a channel whose whole purpose is to promote a truth-seeking mindset has to be\n experiment at the edge of what is truthful in order to fulfill that purpose, it is something that I often worry about. You know, when I did like risk in my life to do X, it's like, well, what probability of death does there have to be for you to risk your life? Like, 50%?\n and\n But what I realized is that I don't have to trust my instincts. This problem of getting the best\n title and thumbnail, it's a scientific problem. We're just asking which accurate representation of the video will get the most clicks from a general audience. And that's a problem we can use the scientific method to solve. So I've hired a couple of really bright people\n and we spend a lot of time brainstorming and making titles and thumbnails and testing them out, for example on Twitter and Patreon. Veritasium titles and thumbnails have gotten better not because I'm better at it, but because of my team and our testing. If you have ideas about how we\n could do it better, please get in touch. The results have often contradicted what I expected. This video seemed to perform 10% better when we excluded the word surprising from the title, so it became simply the secret of synchronization. I thought\n People thought these two titles were basically a toss-up, but Patreon had a strong preference for one over the other. What's interesting about this research is that the more clickable titles and thumbnails often better represent the content of the video. Let me give you some examples.\n One thing I didn't expect when YouTube brought in the real-time analytics tools and allowed title and thumbnail changes to affect impressions was that it would also work for older videos. So here is an old video that I originally entitled, Why the Neutron is the Hero of Nuclear Physics.\n In hindsight, it's a weird kind of meaningless title. So I changed it to why Einstein thought nuclear weapons impossible. It's clearer, more accurate, and this is what happened to views after the change.\n I changed strange applications of the Magnus effect to backspin basketball flies off dam. Again, more accurate and the video is now being watched on YouTube. Probably 10 million more views than it otherwise would have had.\n even anti-clickbait has proven effective. Here's a video I originally titled, are negative ions good for you? Which is a question nobody asked ever. Now I changed it to, do salt lamps work?\n Seriously, and here's the result. One and a half million more views. I think looking at these examples you could easily make the case that YouTube has made me better at what I do. It has improved\n the clarity and accuracy of my titles and thumbnails to help me figure out what is interesting to my audience and how to encapsulate that in a single image in fewer than 50 characters. For those of you who worry that a focus on titles and thumbnails will prevent me from picking challenging science\n topics? Well, I simply ask you to look at the videos from the last year or two, like the ones on Goodell's incompleteness theorem, general relativity, Penrose tilings, the logistic map, Newton's method of calculating pi, the one-way speed of light, good titles and thumbnails\n make it possible to tackle these topics and to reach more people who have never heard of them before. There is a symbiotic relationship between views and video quality. The more views we get, the more people, locations, props and equipment and research we\n can invest in. This makes the next video better than the last. If we can be good at titles and thumbnails, the ultimate outcome is better videos. That is something I think you and I both want.\n Hey, this video is sponsored by KiwiCo, a long time supporter of the channel. Now KiwiCo makes awesome hands-on projects for kids, including big kids like me. They have eight subscription lines targeted at different age groups all the way down\n to newborns. What I love about KiwiCo crates is that they make learning fun and something to look forward to. I mean, when I pull out a crate, my kids just jump at the chance to make it with me. And all the materials you need come right in the box, so there's no need to run to the store, you just open it up\n and go. My kids and I just built this domino machine which who knows might be inspiration for a viral video. Now the big idea is that while playing and having fun kids learn about STEAM concepts that is science, technology, engineering, art,\n and math and in addition to the project there's a magazine with a lot of additional information so I think this is the best way to learn by doing something yourself and having fun it's how education should be so if you want to try it out go to KiwiCo.com slash Veritasium50 and you'll\n you'll get 50% off your first month of any crate. I will put that link down in the description. So I wanna thank KiwiCo for sponsoring Veritasium and I wanna thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "I'll explain more at the end, but let me set up this clip in five words. Robot killers, Stephen Fry, watch.\n to gunpowder and nuclear bombs. They could mount rapid devastating attacks on a huge scale. Thousands of experts including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have signed an open letter calling for a\n ban on the weapons. They say drones that can autonomously find and eliminate people meeting certain criteria are feasible.\n within years, not decades. But calls for a ban have been rejected by the world's ten largest military powers, and mask has warned that international competition for AI\n superiority is the most likely cause of World War III. So, do we have a recipe for disaster? Let's start with the current situation. During Obama's presidency,\n The number of American troops in war zones dropped by around 90 percent, but there were 10 times more drone strikes. Russia has multiple unmanned drone tanks in development and completely autonomous armoured vehicles.\n vehicles guarding missile bases. America plans to enable its Abrams tanks to control robotic wingman vehicles to attack the enemy while protecting the manned tank. It is also considering a remote\n controlled version of the high-speed Ripsaw vehicle. Air power is already used with relative impunity, and soon the fighters will use AI to control drone wingmen able to carry weapons,\n air defenses and keep human pilots even further from danger. Around the world, anti-ballistic missile defenses and drones are diminishing nuclear deterrence. This is\n the US Navy's new unmanned ship designed to hunt submarines and launch surface weapons. It will cost around $20,000 per day to operate, compared to $700,000 per day for a manned destroyer.\n In a simulation test with the Air Force Research Lab, AI drones repeatedly defeated a human pilot. Former Air Force battle manager Gene Lee tried and failed to hit the drones and was destroyed.\n destroyed by them every time. He said they seemed to be aware of his intentions and reacted instantly to his movements and attacks. Autonomous weapons would be cheap to mass produce and may become available to\n terrorists and dictators on the black market. A recent report by the US Defense Science Board called for immediate action to accelerate military AI development and understand the capabilities of other powers.\n It also noted that commercial drones are rapidly improving and private AI firms are well ahead of the military. Some argue AI will reduce accidental casualties by making fewer mistakes.\n If a soldier believes someone is a threat, their life depends on making a quick decision. A robot, on the other hand, could react a fraction of a second before it's fired on, or even wait until it's attacked.\n weapons could also be extremely effective at assassinations, subduing populations and selectively killing particular ethnic groups. The Second Revolution in warfare brought the world close to\n World War III with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Third Revolution may be even more volatile. We also need to plan for an even greater threat from AI itself. Many experts believe it will\n human intelligence in the next few decades. It may then assume full control of the world's networked weapons. Would it use them for peacekeeping or for bringing humanity to a quick end?\n Whether or not humans retain control, an AI arms race may be a race to Armageddon. We believe a ban that's difficult to enforce is better than a ban that's\n than a world flooded with cheap, anonymous, autonomous weapons. What do you think?\n So I hope you enjoyed that clip or were frightened by it. Let me know what you thought in the comments below. That clip was actually made by friends of mine who run a YouTube channel called Pindex. They make\n incredibly high quality educational videos. Whenever I see those Boston Dynamics videos come out, I'm always simultaneously amazed at the achievements that\n they've been able to produce and simultaneously scared that I'm watching the birth of the ancestors of our future robot overlords. So yeah, I've got mixed feelings about this, but I think it's a really important topic and that's why I wanted to share this clip with you.\n you\n a full-length 90-minute documentary coming out in the summer of this year. It'll be available globally so watch out for that. I will be giving you some updates closer to the day and I also have a pilot for a brand new series that I worked on with MinutePhysicist\n and MinuteEarth, I will put a link in the description. And if you're in the US, you can go check it out. Other places are geo-blocked. I, you know, I can't say anything for that, but it's our intention to try to get the series out to as many people around the world as we possibly can.\n So if you can check it out, go and do that now. And I will be posting some more videos soon, I promise. And hopefully it will explain why I've been absent for some of this time. So yeah, I hope you enjoyed that clip.\n clip."

            "transcription": "Have you heard of Virtual Bagel? Their Facebook page has over 4,000 likes. They use the page to promote their brilliant business model. We send you bagels via the internet. Just download and enjoy. It sounds like a joke, and it is, sort of.\n of\n illegitimate way. The illegitimate way is to go to a website like BoostLikes.com and purchase some likes. You can get a thousand for seventy dollars. Sites like these use click farms in developing countries like India, the Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia,\n and Bangladesh. Here, employees are routinely paid just $1 per thousand clicks of the like button. So Facebook explicitly forbids buying likes in this way. Instead, they offer the legitimate way to pay for likes, by advertising your page. Prominently displayed is a link\n to get more likes. With a promise, connect with more of the people who matter to you. And this is how Virtual Bagel got its 4,000 likes. Rory Callan Jones paid $100 to Facebook and the likes rolled in. He targeted his ad to the UK and the United States but also to countries\n like Egypt, Indonesia and the Philippines. Now where do you think Virtual Bagel was most popular? I'll give you a hint, it wasn't the US or the UK. But within a day he had over 1600 likes, mostly from developing countries. Now what was more problematic was the people\n who followed Virtual Bagel looked suspicious. For example, there was one Cairo-based follower whose name was Ahmed Ronaldo. His profile consisted almost exclusively of pictures of Cristiano Ronaldo and he liked 3,000 pages. Callan Jones also observed that his new throng of\n of fans was particularly disengaged, just as you'd imagine those from a click farm would be. But he hadn't hired a click farm, he had paid for Facebook ads. This story was reported in July 2012. In August, Facebook reported they had identified and deleted 83\n So did they delete all of the fake likes? Nope. Not even close. I know because most of the likes on my Facebook page\n page are not genuine. In May 2012, I received a number of emails from Facebook offering me $50 worth of free promotion of my page, which at the time had only 2,000 likes. My YouTube channel had 20 times that following, so I thought surely this free paid promotion\n could help me reach more of the people who mattered to me. And immediately I could see the results. Within just a few days my likes had tripled and they kept on growing, thousands per day. And after a few months I had 70,000 Facebook likes, which matched my YouTube subscribers at the time.\n Now what was weird was my posts on Facebook didn't seem to be getting any more engagement than when I just had 2,000 likes. If anything, they were getting less engagement. Now I didn't understand why at the time, but I've since realized it's because most of those likes I was gaining\n through Facebook ads were not from people who were genuinely interested in Veritasium. How do I know? Well because fake likes behave very differently from real followers. Have a look at this graph of the engagement of my Facebook followers. Now here I'm plotting kind\n as bubbles so this is Canada and the size of the bubble represents the number of likes I've received from that country so this is the United States it's a nice big bubble now I'm ranking these countries on a horizontal axis based on what percentage of the\n likes have engaged with my page this month. So as you can see roughly 30% of Canadians and Americans have engaged with my page but they are not as active as the Germans where over 40% of my likes have engaged and they are not as active as the Austrians, a small but passionate\n group of Veritasium fans at nearly 60%. These are all of the other western countries, so you can see that it's common for between 25% and 35% of my page likes to engage with my page every month. Now here is Egypt, where less than 1%\n 80% of my likes have engaged with my page. Now this is India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri Lanka. That's a big following but no engagement. Together all of these countries make up 80,000 likes.\n That's roughly 75% of the total likes I had before my last video. And these are the profiles that followed me when I used Facebook advertising. And they're worse than useless. Here's why. When you make a post, Facebook distributes it to a small fraction.\n of the people who like your page, just to gauge their reaction. If they engage with it by liking, commenting, and sharing, then Facebook distributes the post to more of your likes, and even their friends. Now if you somehow accumulate fake likes, Facebook's initial distribution goes out to fewer real\n fans and therefore it receives less engagement and so consequently you reach a smaller number of people. That's how a rising number of fans can result in a drop in engagement. And from this Facebook makes money twice over. Once to help you acquire new fans and then again when\n you try to reach them. I mean, your organic reach may be so restricted by the lack of engagement that your only option is to pay to promote the post. What's worse, there is no way to delete fake likes in bulk. All you can do is try to target posts around them.\n And I should reiterate, I never bought fake likes. I used Facebook's legitimate advertising. But the results are as if I had paid for fake likes from a click farm. Now you might think the solution to all of this is just to exclude countries with click farms from your ad campaign.\n But unfortunately, the problem goes much deeper. Meet Virtual Cat, a virtual pet like none other. It's a page committed to supplying only the worst, most annoying drivel you can imagine. Only an idiot would like this page.\n And that's not just my opinion, that's actually what it says in the page description. And I should know because I wrote it. I created this page yesterday and then I paid $10 to advertise the page through Facebook, targeted only to cat lovers in United States\n Canada, Australia, and the UK. Now I expected that because I had excluded all of the big click farm countries and because the page is so terrible that I basically wouldn't get any likes but within 20 minutes I had blown through my whole budget and I got 30\n All of the profiles were from the places I had targeted, mostly the US, but there was something strange about them. All of these people liked a lot of things.\n like hundreds and thousands of things and a lot of the things they liked were odd too like in one account this person liked T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon they like Jeep and Lexus and Mercedes and Volvo and Volkswagen they like\n everything. Other accounts I saw they like kitchen scrubbers and they like mouthwash. Who reports that on their Facebook page? It just baffles me. So the real mystery to me is why someone somewhere would click on ads that they didn't care about without making money from\n them. I mean, I don't think these clicks came from bots, they're too easy to identify and eliminate. And I also don't think for a second Facebook would pay ClickFarms to click on those ads to generate revenue for them. So it really seems like a mystery. And then, in\n In this article, I found what I think is the most reasonable hypothesis. Click farms, click the ads for free. In order to avoid detection by Facebook's fraud algorithms, they like pages other than the ones they've been paid for to seem more genuine.\n You can imagine a thousand likes on a particular page coming from one geographic area in a short period of time would seem pretty suspicious. But buried in a torrent of other like activity, they would be impossible to identify. So workers at these click farms will literally click any\n I mean, where do you think Facebook's security page is most popular? Dhaka, Bangladesh. What about Google? Dhaka. What about soccer star David Beckham? That's actually Cairo. But you take my point. So wherever you're targeting, advertise\n Advertising your page on Facebook is a waste of money. I wish Facebook would remove the fake likes from my page and from all the others, but that would mean admitting that they have generated significant ad revenue from clicks that weren't genuine, which then suppressed the reach of pages\n who had low engagement, forcing those pages to pay again to reach inauthentic fans. So the truth is, Facebook benefits by maintaining this status quo. Because the reality is, nobody likes this many things!\n The first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I saw the first time I\n you"

            "transcription": "Film is a very straightforward technology. It just involves taking a two-dimensional image and focusing it onto a two-dimensional piece of film and there you have a photo. But video, and by that I mean\n moving electronic images has a very different history with a lot of changes that have really transformed the way it works. This video was sponsored by B&H Photo, which is kind of fitting because that's where I get a lot of my gear to make these videos. So I'll tell you\n more about them later, but now it's off to San Francisco. I'm going to meet with a guy who knows a lot about old video gear, and he's got something he's going to show me. Richard?\n Nice to meet you Derek. Come on in. So welcome to Lab Guys world. It's a cool a cool spot you got here. Thank you. The fundamental problem of video is taking this two-dimensional light image and turning it into a one-dimensional\n dimensional electrical signal. So how do you do that? Well the solution actually comes from the first ever fax machine, which believe it or not was invented in 1843 by Alexander Bain. Now he was a clockmaker.\n His invention involved a transmitter and receiver which each had a pendulum and those pendulums were synchronized. So what would happen is at the transmitter there would be a metal sheet on which something was written or drawn using\n a non-conducting ink.\n Now Alexander Bain only ever transmitted static images, but some people have called him the real father of television.\n because he invented scanning. This idea of moving back and forth across an image, breaking it down into lines. But if you really want to get moving images, well, you need to be able to scan much faster. So we have to jump forward\n to 1884 and a 23 year old German university student named Paul Nipkow. He patented what is called the Nipkow Disc, which is basically a big disc with a spiral of holes in it.\n the scanning and if I go fast enough you can see the scan. You would put a light behind this Nipkov disc and so you'd have a spot of light which scans across your subject, say a person, and then there would be reflected light off that\n person which would be picked up by some light sensors. That would create an electrical signal which you could transmit over distance to a receiver. Now at the receiver you use that electrical signal to modulate the brightness of a light source and then in front of\n that you place a synchronized NIPCOB disk and so the result is a recreation of the image from the transmitter. So it was just barely at the limits of the ability to make a viewable picture and it was actually broadcast for a couple of years in\n This is arguably the first ever broadcast television image. It was broadcast for a few hours a day for several years, and it was used by engineers to\n perform experiments and try to improve the quality of the broadcast. What it proved was that this wasn't the way to do it. So by 1939, mechanical TV was all but phased out and it was replaced by all\n electric TV. Specifically, the cathode ray tube. So this is a glass vacuum tube with an electron gun at the back, and the electron gun would fire a beam of electrons at the screen,\n It was coated in a chemical which produced light when it got hit by the electrons that's called a phosphor and using magnetic fields this beam was scanned across the screen top to bottom left to right and You would vary the brightness of the beam by varying\n the voltage on a control electrode, essentially determining how many electrons would get sent out in that beam at any instant to hit the screen. So if you send out a lot of electrons you get a bright spot, if you don't then you get a dark spot and in that way you can produce a nice black\n and white image. And if you're wondering about color TV, well there were a number of dead ends along the path to the red green blue pixel system that became the standard. Like this TV with a spinning color wheel. I named the project Goldmark 1 in honor of Dr.\n It displayed 24 frames per second, but each frame required 6 scans. Blue, green, red, blue, green, red. It worked really well, but it wasn't backwards compatible\n with black and white TVs. And this is a mini-trinoscope, so named for its three cathode ray tubes, one for each color, and their images were combined with prisms.\n So the ultimate solution was to have red, green, and blue phosphors for each pixel\n and three electron guns to determine their relative brightness. Now the number of lines those electron beams make across the screen is in theory 525 every 30th of a second. But this is achieved by scanning every\n line each 60th of a second. So it actually takes two scans to make one frame. This is called interlacing. And what you'll notice watching this is that most of the time you're actually staring at a blank screen. The illusion of a contiguous\n So initially I was thinking this wouldn't be too hard to film. I mean, a 30th of a second or a 60th of a second\n That's not terribly fast, but then if you think about it, 262 and a half lines being drawn every 60th of a second, that is 15,750 lines\n drawn per second? That is fast. So if you want to be able to see the lines being drawn on, you need to shoot faster than 15,000 frames per second. A lot faster really to be able to see this clearly. And so I am using\n the phantom v2512. That is the beast that is allowing me to produce these images. Now the actual resolution of these TVs turned out to be around 480 lines. So when you select\n 480p on YouTube, that's why this is an option. And I guess it's worth pointing out that the tube in YouTube is this thing. A cathode ray tube. So in the time before light-sensitive chips like we all use in our cameras\n today, how did you actually create the image to display on a television? Well, there were many vacuum tube designs. One of the most common was the image orthicon tube, sometimes called Emmy for short. In fact, that's where the name Emmys comes\n So the way it would work is you use the camera lens to focus an image onto the front of the image orthicon tube and that was coated with a photoelectric substance so it would release electrons in proportion to the light that hit them. Now those electrons were caught\n And of course where there's more electrons that creates a more negative spot on this target.\n from the back of the tube you'd send forward an electron beam to scan across the target and so these electrons as they came in the more negative a spot that was on the target the more that beam would get reflected and so that reflected\n The beam was amplified in the tube and then used as the signal to essentially determine how bright that part of the image should be. So this is how television images were created and displayed for decades, but here is\n crazy thing. There was no way to record them. I mean, the purpose of video or the purpose of electronic images was really to transmit something from one place to another. Television literally means\n seeing at a distance. It's not about recording for replaying later, as film was. The thing that blew me away was realizing that video cameras existed for a couple decades before videotape.\n That's right. That was the era of live broadcasting. But this introduced some problems. For example, in North America, in the US, a lot of the TV programs were produced out in New York. And there was a coaxial cable which went across\n the whole of the US, and that could deliver programming to, say, Los Angeles. But it was at the wrong time. I mean, a news broadcast from New York at 6 or 7 p.m. couldn't just be broadcast live at 3 or 4 p.m. on the West Coast. It just didn't make any sense.\n So you needed to time delay it. So how did they do it? Well, the answer was to take a film camera, a cinema camera, and point it at a television screen and actually film the television screen. Then you would quickly develop the\n film and bring it back three hours later to broadcast it live, to scan it in and broadcast that film as though it were live.\n This became such a prevalent method of doing business for the TV networks that by 1954,\n The television networks, to time delay their programming, were using more film than all the film studios in Hollywood combined. This is absurd and expensive and wasteful. So a different method was really needed.\n And that came along in 1956 with the invention of the first workable videotape recorder. It was the size of a large desk and it cost a fortune. It ran on this two inch magnetic tape with little video\n video heads spinning at 14,000 rpm. We're talking as fast as a jet engine. That is the kind of technology it took before video became what we kind of know it as today, a method of recording and\n storing images rather than a way of just transmitting vision from one place to another. But we've come a long way since then, miniaturizing the tapes down into VHS and beta and eventually down to DV and mini DV and now we are\n onto solid-state storage. And you know, I've glossed over a lot of the history here, but now we're in a situation where video is better than film. You can see that in 2012 that was the inflection point\n between people using film to shoot the top-grossing movies changing over to people using digital. And what this has done for people like you and me is it's made it possible to make really good images. And the question\n The question I have is what does this do to a society? What might it do when people can share every part of their lives with video?\n So this video was sponsored by B&H Photo, literally one of my favorite stores in the world. They have all the greatest and newest camera gear plus pro audio and lighting and computers, basically anything you could need to make high quality video.\n Every time I'm out in New York I go and visit the store. The last time I was there I asked them for a gimbal because I'd been seeing all these comments saying my videos were too shaky and so they recommended this one right here and I've really loved it. It's so smooth I can hold it with one hand\n and\n highly recommend it. I bought it for my wife for Christmas, the Christmas before last, and it was backordered. But you can actually sign up through their website to get notified when it's in stock, and I did that and managed to get it in time for Christmas. So it's a really great shopping experience that people are so knowledgeable. It's\n It's a mom and pop shop. It's got anything you could ever want. I highly recommend that you check out B&H Photo. I'll put a link to them in the description. And thanks to B&H for sponsoring this video."

            "transcription": "I was invited here to Munich by BMW, the sponsor of this video, to find out why the future of cars is electric. But electric cars are actually nothing new. They date back to 1832, well before the\n first gasoline powered car. In fact, the first car to go faster than 100 km per hour was, in 1899, an electric one, called the jamais content, meaning never satisfied. But people were, apparently,\n satisfied with electric cars, by 1910 they were almost twice as common on American roads as internal combustion engines. But then came the Model T, which at $650 was significantly cheaper than comparable electric cars.\n And as gas stations popped up around the country, they could be quickly refueled, allowing you to travel farther, faster, and cheaper than electric cars, which took a long time to recharge. So by 1935, the electric vehicle\n had been commercially obliterated. But electric cars were still useful for some things. In the vacuum of space, an electric vehicle was the obvious choice for the Apollo lunar roving vehicle. It was a single-use vehicle due to its\n non-rechargeable silver zinc potassium hydroxide battery and it had a range of just 92 kilometers but the astronauts never needed even half of this range. At the Munich Olympics in 1972\n To lead marathon runners in their race, BMW created an electric version of its 2-series car. The car ran on 12 large car batteries for a maximum range of 60 kilometers or 37 miles. This demonstrated\n the benefits of electric vehicles. They can run quietly with no emissions. But it also illustrated their limitations. With the battery technology available at the time, electric cars were expensive and short range, impractical for\n everyday use. So why are electric cars the future? In 2020, BMW is launching the iX3 all-electric sport utility vehicle, and they plan to have 25 electrified vehicles in their fleet by\n A lot of their concept cars, like the Vision M Next, are electric vehicles. And they have a Formula E car which can now run a whole race on a single battery pack. This is all made possible by\n developments in battery technology. Batteries have gotten a lot better, particularly with the introduction of lithium ion batteries. First used in mobile phones about 30 years ago, lithium ion batteries have almost two times more energy in the same volume\n than the next best battery chemistry. Because of their use in many consumer products like phones and laptops, their manufacturing costs continue to decline, driven by manufacturing and supply chain optimization. Over the last three decades, the\n energy density has increased both per unit mass and per unit volume, while the price has plummeted. This is unlike internal combustion engines, which after a century of development have few areas left for improvement.\n And the reality is, you don't really travel that far in a car. The batteries available today are good enough for all but the longest road trips. In the US, 99% of trips are under 160 kilometres, or 100 miles.\n And electric cars are just better vehicles. Here are my top 10 reasons why. First, more torque from a standstill. Thanks to the batteries under the floor, they have a\n center of mass and so better handling. Since you can drive electric motors independently, you can have precise control over each wheel for maximum traction. Electric cars are quieter.\n Electric cars are cheaper to run than gas cars because gas is more expensive than electricity for the same distance traveled. Electric cars are more efficient than gas cars both in converting stored energy into energy of motion and in reducing\n generating some of that energy and braking. You never have to visit a gas station because you can recharge at home. There's less maintenance, fewer moving parts, no oil changes, and the brakes wear out less often\n Thanks to regenerative braking. And depending on the source of electricity, in my case solar panels, electric cars don't produce any CO2 at all, so they don't contribute to climate change. Plus, as cars become essentially computers on wheels, electric vehicles\n are leading the way towards self-driving cars. We're gonna start our ride in an autonomous vehicle, my first time ever. Level 4 autonomy. Once this becomes commonplace, it's likely we'll change how we see cars from something we own that's\n sits idle for most of its existence to transportation as a service, something we ride in to get from point A to point B and something we share with others. There are still a lot of details to work out but it's clear\n me that the future of cars is electric, autonomous and shared.\n you"

            "transcription": "I want to talk about Khan Academy. If you haven't heard of it, you should definitely check it out. One guy, Sal Khan, has made thousands of\n videos, over 2,200 at the moment, on everything from math to history and also quite a few videos about\n science. And there are a lot of things to love about Khan Academy. First of all, everything's freely available through YouTube. Khan's goal is to improve the education for\n all students and he is an exceptional teacher and absolutely fantastic speaker. He also emphasizes mastery which I think is very important so students in the program can only move on after completing ten questions in a row correctly.\n He's also developed some activities and software, and he's working with schools to try to humanize the classroom, to try to help improve the quality of student-teacher time. He's pushing the learning well beyond that.\n the video area. But I want to put that work aside for a moment and just focus on the millions of viewers who watch his science videos online. You see, I'm skeptical that they actually promote some meeting\n for learning, and that's not just a comment about Khan's videos, but a comment on science videos in general. So let me explain that skepticism. I wrote my PhD thesis on how to create films to teach science, specifically physics.\n In a typical study, students accessed a website where they took a multiple choice pre-test. The questions were something like, consider a basketball player shooting from the free throw line. After the ball leaves his hand, the force on the ball is 8.\n a, upwards and constant, b, upwards and decreasing, c, downwards and constant, d, downwards and decreasing, or e, tangent to the path of the ball.\n Take a minute to think about which answer you would pick, and what you think most other people would pick. After the pre-test, students were randomly assigned to see one of several online videos. The videos contained correct answers to many of the pre-test questions. For example, here's\n a clip. Now we'll consider a case where gravitational force is the only force acting on an object. While a juggling ball is in the air, we'll ignore air resistance because it's so small, only one force acts on the\n ball throughout its flight. This is the force of gravity which is constant and downwards. Gravity accelerates the ball in the downwards direction. After being thrown up, a ball travels slower\n slower upwards. Its velocity goes through zero and then it speeds up in the downward direction. The whole time the ball is accelerating downwards then it meets the juggler's hand.\n Immediately after watching the roughly 10 minute video, the students took exactly the same test. I also interviewed some students to see what they thought of the video. The most common comments were that it was clear, concise, and easy to\n to understand. The students also increased their confidence in the correctness of their answers compared to the pretest. So what about how much they learned? On the pretest, the average score was 6.0 out of 26. And after the video, the average was\n 6.3. What was going on? I dug deep in interviews to find out. It turned out students did not even correctly remember what was presented in the video that they had seen a few minutes earlier. One recalled,\n In the video it said the ball is slowly decreasing in force, so therefore it stops at one point and then comes down. What was worse, another told me it wasn't that hard to pay attention to because I knew already what she was talking about. I hadn't told him about this sick\n What can be done about this? Perhaps videos are just too passive a medium to attract attention for 10 minutes, even when you know you're being interviewed after. But I see the problem with this.\n in a different way. Typically we think of education as informing students about things they are not aware of, like the French Revolution for example. But science presents a different challenge. It is not that students know nothing about it, but that they already have\n plenty of ideas, most of which are, unfortunately, wrong, scientifically speaking. They don't pay attention because they think they know it, and then when asked what they saw, they falsely remember their own ideas as what was presented. Is there a way\n to overcome this? Well, I thought students might pay more attention and be able to understand if their ideas were presented in the video. So one of the other videos involved an actor pretending to be a student with the most common misconceptions, which were illustrated.\n Can you tell me what happens when a single ball goes around once? Well, Luke's hand gives the ball a force that drives it upwards against gravity. But as it goes up, this force\n He then discussed with the other dialogue participant why the misconception didn't work and\n the scientific idea differed. In interviews with students who watched this video, no one used the words clear, concise, or easy to understand. Most often, they said it was confusing. But on the post-test, the average score\n nearly doubled to 11 out of 26. When asked to rate how much mental effort they invested in watching the videos, students who saw the dialogue with misconceptions averaged a whole point higher than those who saw the explanation without misconceptions.\n And it seems like it worked. That increased mental effort translated into more learning. So with the Veritasium films, I always try to start with the misconceptions. How long does it take for the earth to go around the sun? Well, a day.\n Obviously the day is. This is representing the earth. Okay. And this represents what do you think? The moon? Yes, how far apart are they? Like roughly? Is the following statement true?\n True or false? Humans lived at the same time as dinosaurs. I'll say true. We really have to tackle these misconceptions somehow. It seems if you just present the correct information, five\n things happen. 1. Students think they know it. 2. They don't pay their utmost attention. 3. They don't recognize that what is presented is different to what they are already thinking. 4. They don't\n learn a thing. And finally, five, perhaps most troublingly, they get more confident in the ideas they were thinking before. This is a vicious cycle that we have to find a way to break in order to have effective science education.\n So the Khan videos are amazing and definitely a valuable resource for science educators and perhaps people looking for a bit of review. But for those who are just starting to learn science, I question whether it's going to be that valuable because it doesn't really\n question their misconceptions.\n you"

            "transcription": "This video was filmed without sound. Is it possible to use only these images to reconstruct the sound? That is, can you hear pictures? In this video, I'm going to try to demonstrate that it's possible to get sound from pictures.\n But it's not gonna be easy, so I'm gonna need some help. This episode was sponsored by LastPass, which allowed me to fly to the Bay Area to meet with one of my science heroes. So now, on with the video.\n video.\n crumpled up ball of tinfoil. Yeah, like if I had a more powerful camera and I had like the right lens then you know we could do something that looks more like you're spying on somebody. But we should be able to demonstrate that you can recover\n like a rhythm or a sound from you know whatever camera you have. Now you might think it would be easy to record sound in video because after all sound is just vibrations so the air is vibrating back and forth and everything it hits should\n vibrate back and forth too. So you think all we need to do is video that motion and plot displacement versus time and then recover the sound. But it's not that simple.\n Because for one thing, I mean, these sound vibrations are incredibly tiny. They move objects only about one micrometer. And even if you're super zoomed in, that is way less than a pixel. We're talking a hundredth or a thousandth of a pixel.\n We're not seeing something that is at one pixel move to an adjacent pixel. You're seeing one pixel get slightly darker and the next pixel gets slightly brighter. What objects were\n So what are some good examples?\n Well, like a bag of chips. You know, the initial experiments were very like contrived in a way. You know, we had these objects on optical benches, we were blasting light at them, the sounds were like as loud as we could make them.\n We had a little lamb. Little lamb? Little lamb. I figured we'd try to do a rhythm. This is... Shaving a haircut.\n Let's put that camera on a tripod. Oh yeah, that's that I mean that'd be great. All right. Let's give it a shot This is the actual\n clip I recorded, and I want you to notice two things. First, you can't really see much motion. And second, there are plenty of pixels getting dimmer and brighter because of image noise. I mean, it's not a pristine, perfect image. So\n So how do you tell the difference between pixels getting brighter and dimmer due to tiny movements versus noise? Essentially you look for edges in the image and then you say well if the object moves by some fraction of a fraction of a pixel in one\n particular direction, then pixels on one side of that edge will get a little bit brighter, pixels on the other side of that edge will get a little bit darker. And so basically what we do is we sum together all the ones that are supposed to get brighter and subtract all the ones that are supposed to get darker, and then\n That gives us one number. And if you track that number over time, then that gives you an estimate of the displacement over time. This is time, but in samples. And this is position.\n Hmm, so what are you doing? Um, well, we're gonna try to do some filtering on that It's clipping\n I mean it's not much It's not much but\n You can recognize two of the beats. This is what we've recovered from 180 frames per second, which isn't really a whole lot within the range of like audible frequencies. So that's why\n you know, kind of the most we can hope for here is a bit of a rhythm. Now of course the main limiting factor is frame rate because we can hear sounds from 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz but most cameras only shoot 30 frames per second so they miss virtually all\n of the sound frequencies. Imagine this is the motion created by a 30 Hertz sound. If you try to capture this with a camera at 30 frames per second you would end up seeing the object always in the same position because it's at the same\n point in the wave cycle so your perception would be that the object is not moving at all. So in order to measure a frequency of sound you actually need to sample at least twice that frequency which is why a lot of music is sampled at\n or 48 kilohertz. That's more than twice as much as the highest sound we can hear. At any rate, if you want to get something more intelligible, you're going to need some higher frame rate camera. So we just went to the camera store and picked up a\n new camera that should be able to shoot a thousand frames per second or thereabouts. Is that going to be enough? It'll be enough for something. I love that confidence. This is one modular\n away from dubstep right here. Just a little bit more of a bump, bump, and then we'd have the next big track. I've set it to a thousand frames per second. Now we're talking. Yeah.\n Okay. Okay, so you have the footage there and you're cropping in a bit. Tell me about that. Well, we're running this on my laptop as opposed to the\n servers that I had back at MIT and that is gonna mean that if we run it on the full video my laptop will crash. Okay. So we're gonna crop it and try it on that. I can see a little bit of motion. Yeah I mean I think that one\n question is whether that's like... resonant motion? Yeah well in this case would be kind of like the equivalent of a rocking chair. Like if the if the foil has a like a rocking mode then that's actually not gonna give us a lot of sound information. Can you tell\n whether this is going to work or not. I am optimistic. I think because I know what I'm listening for I can hear it in there. Yeah you gotta be careful though\n Really? You can just... You gotta be careful that you're not confirmation biased. Sure. Let's try that.\n That's about 60 Hertz. That seems a little much. Okay, we're gonna try one more time. We have basically put the piece of foil on top of the speaker. We're dialing up the volume to 11. Uh, well, I mean it's a shower speaker.\n Cool. So what do you think of that image there? It's beautiful. It's gorgeous.\n It has been like a couple years since I have looked at this code so I suspect I might have forgotten something and I'm using it wrong but I want to point something out here which is\n And here is what we recovered. And here is the piano roll of the signal that we sent. This looks like duh duh to me. And that's the duh. Yeah. Yeah.\n That's it. That is the... Yeah, okay. So let's see if we can actually get it to hear that. We can see it, we just can't hear it. I think I know what it is.\n It is. What is it? I don't think my laptop can play those frequencies. Hold on a second. Let me get some headphones. Maybe real speakers or something.\n What are you hearing? Hold on.\n I hear shaving a haircut, two bits. Here, listen to this. Alright. Here, I'll hold it. Thank you.\n Yeah. And, bit shift.\n This was a basic proof of concept, but Abe showed that with more powerful equipment, he could recover human speech\n from outside soundproof glass.\n Have you ever considered that your computer is a physical system that gives off vibrations? Each key on the keyboard produces a unique sound due to its unique location. In fact, research has shown that audio recordings of typing reveal 96% of\n keystrokes accurately. This portion of the video was sponsored by LastPass, an app that stores all your usernames and passwords so you never have to type them in.

            "transcription": "This video was sponsored by LastPass. Okay, we have three garage doors here. The question is, can you open them, sir?\n We'll try. There it goes. He's got one. He's got two! The point of this video is to show how easy it is to reprogram a toy to open almost any radio frequency\n But first, let's talk about LastPass. You know, the average person these days has about 200 different accounts that require passwords. And of course, 200 different passwords is far too much for anyone to remember.\n So most of us use the same password across multiple sites and that is just a terrible idea So you really need a password manager and LastPass can do that for you can store all of your passwords in the one place which means you never have\n have\n store there, also free sync across all of your devices, and if there is a password breach you get an alert. Plus, LastPass has multi-factor authentication and as anyone who knows the internet knows, that is the best way to keep your account secure you should\n Use it on LastPass and all the other places where you possibly can. Recently LastPass teamed up with Ubiqui and Microsoft to support their multi-factor authentication. So to find out more about LastPass, check out the link in the description. And thanks again to LastPass for sponsoring this video.\n And now, let's try to break into my garage. Alright. What do we got? No wonder you have so many if you treat them like this.\n Okay, well, do you want to see the signals that these produce? Sure. Let's do that. This is my friend Sammy. Now when you're dealing with garage like garage door remotes, they're typically in what's known as an ISM band industrial scientific medical. Basically, they don't need to get really licensed to use\n those bands anyone can use them within some power rating within the US and typically it's gonna be like 300 or 433 megahertz. Alright so when I hit this button look to the right this is insane\n So, what I can tell just by looking at this is how it's actually modulating the signal and how it's sending it. This is called amplitude shift keying, ASK. And what's happening is every time I'm holding down the button, multiple bits are\n getting sent on a single frequency and it has to do with the time that it's on or off which means a one or zero. Let me ask the obvious question which is like how secure is my garage? It's not. So why don't we record\n the data? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So it looks like your garage uses an 8-bit code. Here we have the dip switches. So we basically see low, low, low, high, high,\n high, low low.\n is 256 possibilities to open your code. Now let's see, let's just see how long this, this period of data is. So this is about 32 milliseconds.\n 32 milliseconds to send a single code. So if we did 32 milliseconds times the 256 possibilities, it would take 8,000 milliseconds, 8 seconds to open your garage. Testing every possible variation of the code.\n Now Sammy might be overstating how easy it would be to open the garage because presumably you can't send all the codes back to back otherwise how does the garage receiver know what constitutes one code so you probably have to leave a\n gap between codes. Let's say we left a gap between codes that was roughly equal in length to the code itself. Well, that doubles the time out to 16 seconds. Okay, still not great, but I guess that reveals the shortcomings of 8-bit codes.\n But a lot of garages these days are actually 12-bit. So if you used a 12-bit code that would give you 4096 different codes that you would have to try and again adding in gaps between each code that would take around\n and a half minutes. But then Sammy found something interesting.\n were ABCD and I just did X ABCD but it's still opened. Do you want to try it again? Yeah. In fact let me try putting even more information up front. You're putting a whole bunch of junk up the front. A whole bunch of junk yeah. But I\n I still have the right password, it's in there, but it's prepended with a bunch of junk. Right. Yeah. It's funny. So what do you think? It opens the door to...\n other issues. So it seems like the receiver is using a shift register, which means it takes in each string of bits and instead of considering one 8-bit string and then throwing it out if it's wrong, it just throws out the first\n bit and then considers the next eight bits. And this has pretty profound security implications. I mean not only does that mean we can throw out all the gaps between our codes that cover all the combinations, it actually means we can\n merge some of those combinations together because essentially we can overlap the codes to make sure we have every combination in there. A sequence like this is called a De Bruijn sequence and that reduces the number of bits you have to send,\n dramatically. For example, if we were to send all 8-bit combinations, that's 256 different codes, that would be 2048 bits altogether. But the De Bruijn sequence that covers all the different combinations\n can be as short as 263 bits. That's a reduction of almost 90%, which means instead of taking eight seconds to open the garage it would take less than one. Now what about in the 12-bit case? Well there are 4096 possible\n codes, which yields 49,152 bits you'd have to send if you wanted to try each code individually. But the De Bruijn sequence for 12 bits is only 4,107 bits long.\n So that's just 8% of the total that you would have to send if you wanted to send each code individually. And so that reduces the time down from about 4 and a half minutes to 10 seconds. So now we are really looking at a way that you can\n possibly brute force your way into any fixed code garage or gate using a device like the IME.\n side called the CC-1110. It's a microcontroller with a transceiver. And the transceiver is really cool because it actually transmits and receives on a really wide range of frequencies down to around 200 megahertz up to like 950 megahertz. So you can talk to a lot of things including\n garages, cars, power meters, alarm systems, all sorts of things are in those bands. And there's actually some contacts underneath a battery in the back which allows you to flash the board, erase it, and install your own software on this device. So you can program in the DeBruin\n sequence and then use this device to play those bits at the frequency you want to play and basically open any garage door or gate you like. So let's give it a try. Question is can you open them sir?\n We'll try. There it goes. He's got one. He's got two. Very nice. Now you might be wondering why the third garage door didn't open and that's because\n because I actually have a different garage door opener which has the next level up of security. Instead of using fixed codes it uses what are called rolling codes. So the way rolling codes work is that both your clicker and the receiver have in\n inside them an algorithm that uses a seed, which could just be a number, to generate a pseudo random number. And that is the code that they both use to communicate. So here I have an online pseudo random number generator.\n I can put in a seed, which in my case I'll just keep it very simple, and I can pick whichever algorithm I want. Now it's okay if the algorithm gets known because the thing that is secret between the transmitter and the receiver is that seed.\n That's the seed they are using to generate the next pseudo random number in the sequence. So I can calculate a random number and this would be the code used by the clicker and the garage door to communicate. If an attacker is sitting outside\n As you can see, I can continue generating\n new pseudo random numbers and if anyone is overhearing this sequence they won't be able to predict what the next number is even if they knew the algorithm they would have to know the algorithm and the seed to make this work and it's not easy just by looking\n at these generated numbers to work backwards to the seed. So you might think this is an unhackable protocol but Sammy has a solution for that too. What I thought was what if you could actually interfere with that signal? So\n So what if I put a device on your garage or car and it looked for a sync word and whenever it saw that there was data coming in, it would jam a frequency close to that. Your car or garage would not be able to hear the actual password that your\n to\n The first one allows your garage to open and you're like, oh great, it worked. Once I hit the button twice. But now I have a future code. I have a code that appears to be in the future and I can then come back later and use that code. These devices have no time. They have no sense of time. All they have is that\n sequence. So that is a kind of a big issue with the rolling codes themselves. Well. But you know what amazed me about this was how hard it actually\n is to hack into these garage doors even the simple 8-bit ones. Not opening that. So we don't have the right code. I have an 8-bit gate that we tried to hack into and we failed every time using the IMB\n Me. Nay. 256 possibilities. Come on. How long can it take you to crack this thing? I think we have a bug to work out. Uh oh. The gate is unmoved. This was meant to be a video about just how easy it would be to crack a fixed code gate.\n But it turns out that it's harder than it looks. I just did that. For a minute Sammy thought he had it. Yeah, the gate.\n to get the frequency exactly right. And the bit rate. And one bit of information for that clicker, which is custom built for that purpose and simply has those dip switches, is not one bit of information for a multipurpose device like the IME. There you have to get the baud rate\n right? That is, the timing at which you're sending these bits. You have to get the length of the bits perfectly right. So it's much more challenging, as I found out, to hack into these systems than I thought. Now, if you want to investigate this,\n more for yourself you should check out Sammy's original videos on these topics. It's very informative and he has links to code that you can use though not fully workable code because he doesn't want to of course expose a lot of people to security breaches so the link to his video is\n down in the description."

However, analysis has shown that each Spanish syllable conveys less information than each English syllable, so the information per minute is almost identical.\n without written language. The square format of Chinese characters appears to fit better into our central visual field than the longer slimmer words of English. This led linguists to suspect that Chinese would be read faster than English. But experiments show that\n English readers can perceive 7 to 8 letters at once, compared to just 2.6 characters for Chinese. However, those Chinese characters are denser in meaning than the English letters, and so both languages have basically an identical reading rate of\n But how can you really quantify information? Well the smallest amount of information you can have is the\n the answer to a yes no question. Like have you seen the movie Frozen? Yes. Yes or no, heads or tails, we can represent this single outcome with a 1 or a 0. One binary digit, it's one bit.\n of information. A roll of the dice has six possible outcomes, so three bits of information are required to cover all the options. To uniquely represent all 26 letters of the English alphabet requires five bits of information, but if you\n lowercase, punctuation, special characters, and numbers that takes the total number of symbols to 95. So you actually need seven bits of information to encode all these symbols. That was first done in 1963 as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.\n or ASCII for short. Now as the next closest power of two, computers adopted 8-bits as the fundamental unit of computation, and they called it the byte, where they intentionally replaced the i with a y so that it couldn't accidentally be confused with a bit.\n So how much information does it take to make you? Well your entire genetic code is contained in the sequence of four molecules represented by the letters T, A, G, and C in your DNA. Each of these four options can be encoded by two\n bits of information. And multiplying by the 6 billion letters of genetic code in your genome and dividing by 8 bits per byte, that yields 1.5 gigabytes of information. So you could fit your entire genetic code on a single DVD with room to spare.\n Now your body has an estimated 40 trillion cells in it and each one contains a full copy of your DNA. So you actually contain 60 zettabytes of information. That's 60 followed by 21 zeros. Just to put this in perspective,\n By the year 2020, all of the digital information in the world is estimated to be equal to 40 zettabytes of information. You could store all of that on 100 grams of DNA. That is less than you have inside your body.\n But now consider this, you share 99.9% of your genetic information with everyone else on earth, meaning that less than one part in a thousand is unique. So the information that makes you you could be\n stored in less than a megabyte. You could put it on one of these. A floppy disk. I guess you don't know what that is. In contrast, video can contain a lot of information. To specify the color of each of 2 million pixels 30 times a second for this entire video\n would require a hundred gigabytes of information. But you can watch this video in HD on YouTube with just a thousandth that amount. Now the reason you can send such a big video with such a small file size is because video like Spanish\n has a lot of parts that are redundant. Hey Michael, you know what I've been thinking about? What have you been thinking about Derek? Information. Go on. It's a physical thing. It's embodied in actual objects.\n How's that? We know like the words we say, they're actual vibrations in the air, right? They're not just concepts, they are real physical things that you could measure and detect. That's true, and they don't go away. They don't disappear even after they've...\n For instance, moved through the air. Right. After we've said these words, they have actually interacted with everything around us. So you're saying that technically I could look at the world and if I knew enough about it and the position of its particles, I could trace it\n back and extrapolate all the information that's ever occurred through them or at them?

Stick around to the end for a word from our sponsor.\n They were asked to entertain themselves with their thoughts, but they could self-administer the shock if they so chose. So what happened? Well, 25% of women and 67% of men showed no reaction.\n shocked themselves. This is despite the fact that they had previously told the experimenters that they would pay money to avoid the shock. Apparently they'd rather experience physical pain than just be bored, to have nothing to keep them occupied.\n But they are not alone. Around 95% of American adults report participating in some leisure activities over the past 24 hours. But only 17% say they spent any time at all\n all, just relaxing and thinking. Because that, apparently, is boring. And being bored is unpleasant. So what is boredom? Well, contrary to popular belief, it's not when you have absolutely nothing to do.\n It's just when none of the options you have available to you appeal to you. Boredom is characterized by a lack of concentration, restlessness, but also feeling lethargic. It's really a state of being underwhelmed. And there are now\n more ways than ever to avoid boredom.\n and nowhere is sacred. Do you ever just let yourself be bored? No, no I generally don't. But are we losing anything by avoiding boredom? Well scientific research says yes, and what we're losing is\n is important.\n Researchers have shown this mind-wandering is useful for creativity. They gave study participants a random boring task. The most boring one? Reading the phone book. Then they asked\n asked participants to be creative, generate as many ideas as they could for what you could do with a plastic cup. Those in the most boring read-the-phone-book condition generated the most creative solutions compared to less bored controls.\n A major reason many researchers suspect that we experience boredom is because it gives you an indicator of your current state. I mean, if you find yourself feeling bored, you know something about that situation isn't working for you. Let me ask you this, when you're in class and you're bored,\n So the paradox of boredom is that it makes you feel tired, sluggish, and just disinterested, but it may actually spur you to actually\n It may get you to make changes that would be positive for your life. And changes like getting this guy's legs out of my face. That would be perfect. In the absence of boredom, one would remain trapped in unfulfilling situations.\n situations, and miss out on many emotionally, cognitively, and socially rewarding experiences. Boredom is both a warning that we're not doing what we want to be doing, and a push that motivates us to switch goals and projects.\n shown that boredom may make you more altruistic. Perhaps the acute sense of aimlessness you experience when you're bored gets out of control and makes you question what you're doing with your life as a whole. But the silver lining is that it may trigger you to think about others and what you\n can do to help them. And that provides an immediate and concrete purpose to a life that might momentarily feel like it's lacking one. You know, studies designed to induce boredom have shown that more bored participants are more likely to donate to charity or to give blood.\n So apparently the opportunity to do meaningful, even if unpleasant activities have more value\n Similarly, this aimless state seems to cultivate thoughts about what you want to do with your life. To think of your life as a story and consider where you want it to go in the future. This is called\n autobiographical planning. When given tasks that only use a fraction of mental capacity, study participants frequently thought of the future and their plans for it. In this way, being bored is essential for goal setting. If your brain is always consumed\n with other stimuli, you'll rarely ponder the bigger picture and set long-term goals for yourself and consider how to achieve them. Does a phone get rid of your boredom? Yeah, actually thinking about it, it does.\n So every time you're waiting for something, you have a decision to make, which seems like a tiny one. Pull out your phone for a few seconds or minutes, or just be bored. Experience only your thoughts. It seems like an insignificant decision.\n And if you don't give it much thought, the obvious action is to see what's new on your app of choice. And in making that decision, you are alleviating a moment of boredom. But you are also likely making yourself less creative, less altruistic, less likely to\n In short, you are the real world example of someone shocking themselves to avoid the unpleasantness of boredom. Except in your case, the pain goes much deeper, to the very navel.\n of who you are and who you will become. So think carefully before pressing that button. So being bored is apparently something our brains\n need to do. Something our brains don't need to do is remember lots of random passwords, which is why the sponsor of this video is LastPass. LastPass is a password manager that offers unlimited password storage plus free\n sync across all your devices and password breach alerts. That way you never have to remember another password or write it down, look for one, forget your passwords, reset them.

Now LastPass has multi-factor authentication which is super important because it keeps your accounts secure\n secure, it also interfaces with Microsoft and Ubiqui's multi-factor authentication.

I mean, it's been so long since the nuclear reactor there melted down and spewed radioactive atoms across the land.\n So for almost 30 years this place has been virtually abandoned. These days workers are allowed into the zone but only for two weeks at a time and that's not because the radiation levels are\n too high, it's actually for psychological reasons. More than two weeks in a place like this will apparently make you think strange things. And I was only here for four days, but I started to think about rocks.\n Rocks appear to be permanent. Mountains are constantly eroding, and in places the crust is melting\n back into the mantle. Rock obviously isn't permanent, but on the scale of a human life, it is. And people have recognized that fact. Rocks are permanent for thousands of years.\n and I think that's what makes them important to us. I mean, a diamond is forever. We build these monuments out of rock because they will outlast us and virtually every other material we can think of.\n Our modern structures of metal and glass are just rock refined by our ingenuity. Rocks are both practical and symbolic. We seek to identify ourselves with rocks. We carve our heroes\n stone because we want them to last forever. And there's a way in which we want that kind of permanence for ourselves too. I think it's at the core of the desire to scratch your name into stone and put your initials in wet cement, really man-made\n rock or fasten a padlock to a bridge. In this way we try to push our impermanence from our minds. The monuments, statues, bridges, they give us a sense of continuity, stability, that this is\n is the way it is and the way it's always been. Like, the way we first conceived of stars. Static. Unchanging. Eternal. And this way of viewing the world helps us maintain our greatest\n delusion, the thought that we are in any way eternal. We want to believe that some part of us, our consciousness or our soul, will last forever.\n But what do you make of it then when you see stone is not even so permanent? Walking around Chernobyl, I think it's understandable that I started contemplating not only the permanence of rocks, but also their decay and by\n extension, our decay, death, what the world would look like without people. You know, the closest I can come to imagining true nothingness is to picture the universe running\n really fast in reverse. All the galaxies squeezing closer together, stars expanding back into gas clouds and everything getting hotter and denser, compactifying until the whole observable universe could fit into a room. And then\n shrinking further into a tiny point and then nothing. Not the nothingness of empty space, but real nothingness, which has no size and no time. To me,\n that is probably what death looks like. A nothingness so complete you wouldn't even miss it. For that you'd have to be there. But just as soon as I can form this thought it evaporates. Like a void in nature\n the world rushes in to fill it. And this makes sense because the hardware I'm running has been developed over billions of years, with the only requirement being that it frequently and accurately makes copies of itself. And it would help not\n in the slightest and the goal of making copies if the hardware could accurately simulate its own non-existence. When we do acknowledge our impermanence it is often through insipid catchphrases like yo low or it's it's\n Maybe in art projects like Damien Hirst's The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, which is just a huge shark in a tank of formaldehyde, a sense of our mortality should strike fear into us.\n The sense I have when I'm swimming hundreds of meters offshore and the water below is deep and dark and I can picture the shark swimming beneath me. The same kind of fate stalks us daily.\n But not in this visceral way, just in a trivial, ignorable way. Hence the delusion. You're permanent, like stone. Always were, always will be. So we are left hardwired for denial.\n a selected inability to imagine true nothingness, an ephemeral sack of particles that thinks itself eternal. This delusion is comforting and it makes living easier. It might drive you\n crazy to be confronted with the ultimate meaninglessness of everything all the time, what we call nihilism. But the same delusion I'd argue is also debilitating. It lulls you into a false sense of security, in\n action, like a due date a long time in the future. There's always tomorrow, so we procrastinate living the life we truly desire. And we live in more fear. The sense that your soul is eternal makes you cowardly\n Because failure would stick with you forever. For really ever. Shame, embarrassment, disappointment. They would never leave you. A distant horizon encourages you to play it safe.\n live to fight another day, for after all, there is always another day. And this is why I find nihilism liberating and emboldening. If you can really picture the nothingness\n that awaits you, then what is there to be afraid of? Errors and humiliations will be forgotten, but great achievements may not. We may have no meaning in the cosmic context\n of the universe, but we make our own meaning daily with each other. And this is the thought that leads to action. Your days are numbered. You don't know what that number is, but it's finite, so get busy with what it is you want to do.\n Time is running out.\n The first time I saw the first picture, I was surprised.\n you"

All around me there is exactly 300 millimeters of rain falling every\n The\n The puzzles at the simulator contain four holes of varying diameters, so they can produce raindrops of different sizes. And the size of the raindrop affects how fast it falls. You've likely experienced the kind of rain with the big droplets that pelt your face, or walked through\n drizzle where small drops hover like mist. Because the smaller the raindrop, the slower it falls. There are two forces that act on a raindrop.\n gravity and air resistance. And the larger raindrops have a higher weight to surface area ratio, and so they have a higher terminal velocity, so they will be falling faster. A raindrop that's 1mm in diameter falls at only about 2 meters per second, while a\n 3mm raindrop falls at 6 meters per second. Air resistance is also why raindrops aren't shaped like cartoon raindrops. They are closer to spherical, but a bit flatter on the bottom where they encounter oncoming air. If a raindrop gets too big,\n It flattens out, caves in in the middle, and briefly resembles a little parachute before it breaks up into smaller droplets. Flooding is something that Japan takes very seriously, and for good reason.\n In 2018, there were floods all over the country due to the rainfall from Typhoon Praperun. Some regions of the country received nearly 2 meters of rain in just 10 days, and the resulting floods were enough that more than 8 million people had to be evacuated from their homes.\n Over 200 people died. And the damage to property from the flooding was more than 1 trillion yen, nearly 10 billion dollars. Tokyo, the capital city of Japan, is very vulnerable to flooding. There are more than 100 rivers criss-crossing the city.\n crossing the city of nearly 40 million people. To prevent the rivers from overflowing, there are pipes and tunnels under the city, leading to an enormous water storage tank. In October 2019, Typhoon Hagibis dumped over 200 millimeters of rain\n onto the city in under 48 hours. The underground system diverted 12 million cubic meters of water and prevented an estimated $1.7 billion in damage. But flooding isn't the only problem.\n Japan is a very mountainous country with many towns and villages situated in valleys. So combined with a heavy rainfall, this creates the perfect conditions for another hazard.\n Oh\n The researchers at N.I.E.D. have identified over 700,000 places\n where landslides are a significant threat to homes. But landslides are so complicated. There are so many factors that affect if a landslide will occur. How large it could be, how fast it will move, and how much damage it will do.\n Not just the slope angle or the amount of new rain, but the type of soil, the minerals present, and the vegetation growing on top of the slope. This is footage from a landslide that occurred in Norway in June of 2020. There's barely\n any slope angle here, but the whole area sits on a layer of quick clay, an incredibly unstable clay layer which, when exposed to intense rainfall, loses its structural integrity, becoming a liquid. In the case of this landslide, there were no casualties\n though several homes were swept out to sea. The complexity of the physics of landslides is why the work done at the large-scale rainfall simulator is so important. The best way to minimize landslide damage is by\n prevention. And it's the same for cybersecurity, creating strong passwords using anti-malware protection, backing up your data, and updating your operating system and software regularly. Something that's particularly useful is a virtual private network,\n like today's sponsor NordVPN. NordVPN hides your IP address and helps protect your online identity. Peter filmed on location in Japan and he used NordVPN to safely access public Wi-Fi hotspots. And I am currently in Australia and I've been using NordVPN\n to watch NHL games. Something I especially like about NordVPN is that their speeds are blisteringly fast, so it's effortless to just keep it turned on all the time. High speeds are\n particularly useful when you're connecting to streaming services and hopping on servers in distant locations to watch content that's only available in those regions. For viewers of this channel, use the link NordVPN.com slash Veritasium for a huge discount on\n a two-year plan plus an extra four months for free. So I will put that link down in the description. There's a 30-day money-back guarantee so it's entirely risk-free. Just go to NordVPN.com slash Veritasium. So I want to thank NordVPN.com\n for sponsoring this part of the video and now back to the world's largest rainfall simulator. All right I'm gonna try it without an umbrella I have a very nice very nice jacket I'm not sure how it's gonna hold up but we're gonna try\n Oh my god, this is insane. Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. My jacket is waterproof, so I was fine. But my jeans are absolutely waterproof.\n To study landslides, the whole warehouse has a secret. It moves. The rainfall simulator can be in one of five positions.\n One meter per minute. Wow. It moves on these railway tracks. Every time you move it, you need to grab this gigantic wrench and undo these bolts.\n This is the pipe that connects all the water up to the sprinklers. There's a number of these kind of openings in the pipe along the line. So when you move it, you just connect it to a different part.\n So this is the landslide testing facility. Yes, this is a 30 degree slope. You can see this. This is a shallow landslide. Now you can put the soil here.\n here now about a one meter. You would put all the sand and all the soil and then you'd bring the building over you'd move it over here yes and then you'd start raining on it.\n Yes. 20 degree this slope is 20 degree. Right, so you have a 30, a 40 and a 20. 20, 30, 40. Yes.\n So what causes landslides? Well a slope will slide when the force of gravity pulling it down becomes greater than the force of friction holding it up. There's a misnomer out there that water makes the material slipperier so it rains and\n So water doesn't make soil\n The soil is porous, there are grains and there are pores between those grains. As it rains, the water seeps into the soil, the pores become filled with water, and as it keeps raining, the water pressure in the pores\n increases, which decreases the friction between the grains. For a slope that was already at risk of sliding, this decrease in friction is what ultimately leads to the slope breaking apart and sliding downhill.\n mathematical models are not very well developed at yet is determining is it going to slide slowly or is it going to slide or maybe flow rapidly. That's a tough one. So experimentation is a great way\n of getting at that. And, you know, the scalar effects are huge. So if many people have a little model in their lab, you know, a small scale flume, but now you're dealing with materials, you know, you're not, you're starting to get off scale. A large\n So how can you prevent landslides? Well, there are a few things you can do, like using steel beams and mesh to anchor the slope. Or you can dig up the top layer\n of the soil to decrease the slope angle. And when it's expected that a slope will slide after too much rain, engineers drill holes into the slope and place pipes to drain the water out. Another solution is to create catchment zones and diversion channels.\n Big holes in the ground that will catch or divert the landslide before it hits a residential area. Trees are incredibly effective at preventing landslides. Not only do their roots provide great anchors, they draw the water up from the soil to be evaporated away.\n which effectively drains the soil and decreases the water level. Where steep slopes have been\n When deforested for the timber industry, landslides have become more common. Over the last few decades, there has been a ten-fold increase in landslides in the forests of British Columbia.\n a heck of a lot more quickly than geologic processes do. So when we excavate over here or add more weight or more landslide or material over here, that triggers landslides very regularly. A study in Seattle from\n Seattle, Washington, a few decades ago, showed that more than 85% had at least partial human trigger, if you will.\n The focus of the work is primarily on landslide study and prevention. The simulator is also used to test how drones fly in rainy and windy conditions. It's also used to test self-driving cars. The data is used to improve the hardware and software\n of how the cars detect various objects. The two main ways that self-driving cars detect other cars, traffic lights and pedestrians, is with cameras or lidar sensors. In both cases, rain can decrease the visibility and accuracy of these sensors.\n So testing them in a perfectly repeatable environment helps engineers develop solutions to these weather challenges. In Japan, the rainfall conditions have changed. Now it's recently been raining.\n As the world heats up due to humanity's addiction to fossil fuels, extreme weather events are becoming more common. Compared to 30 years ago, the number of\n Rain events in Japan with an intensity of 50 millimeters per hour have become 40% more common Rainfall at double that intensity has become 70% more common Climate change will increase the rate of flooding and the occurrence of landslides in the future\n which is why the work done at the world's largest rainfall simulator is becoming more and more important. But I hope that humanity focuses its efforts on addressing the root causes of climate change and not just on the mitigation of its negative impacts.\n you\n you"

            "transcription": "Come take a walk with me around Longyearbyen. That's the largest town on the Norwegian islands of Svalbard.\n Parts of it may look familiar.\n But make no mistake, this place is different.\n At 78 degrees north, it is just 800 miles or 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.\n And with over 2,000 permanent residents, it is the northernmost real town on earth.\n There are only 50 kilometers of road including\n small streets between houses, so people get around the island mainly on snowmobile. In fact, there are more registered snowmobiles than residents.\n Thanks for watching.\n Anyone leaving town is required to travel with a gun and someone who knows how to use it.\n Because the islands are also home to polar bears.\n The average daytime high is below freezing for all but four months of the year. And from the end of October to mid-February, the sun\n The sun doesn't rise at all. This is the long polar night. Living here is tough.\n This past December, an avalanche in town destroyed ten homes, which used to be here, killing two people.\n So how did this cold remote ice-covered\n archipelago come to be inhabited? Well, the hills around town are rich in coal deposits that have been mined for over a hundred years.\n The coal was transported to the port via a series of aerial tramways, some of which remain today, though they are no longer operational.\n Coal is a reminder that Svalbard was not always an arctic ice world. 360 million years ago it was actually in the tropics just north of the equator. A swampy area it was covered with the precursors\n to modern ferns, which were much larger than they are today, reaching 10 to 30 meters in height. This vegetation was then covered in mud and sand and submerged under the sea.\n At the time, it turned into the coal deposits that in the 20th century brought miners from Norway, Russia, and the US.\n Most of the coal mines have now closed and the economy is gradually shifting towards tourism, education, and research.\n Tourists take trips on snowmobiles and dog sleds. There is a university center in Svalbard which offers semester courses in biology, physics and geology.\n And up on the side of a mountain is the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, but that's a story for another time.\n Locals tell me that interest in the region from different nations is increasing. As the globe warms and Arctic ice shrinks, trade routes are opening up across the north.\n And Svalbard is strategically placed between North America, Asia, and Europe. So one day in the future, Svalbard may no longer be as cold\n or as remote as it once was. But for now, it is a reminder of how through our ingenuity\n the people can live in even the most inhospitable of places.\n The film is set to be released on May 24, 2019.\n The first time I saw her,

            "transcription": "On December 1st, 2022, the journal Nature published a cover story about a holographic wormhole. It was purportedly created inside a quantum computer to probe the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity. The story kicked off a frenzied\n of tweets and news headlines.\n This video was sponsored by Shopify. The problem was, of course, that no wormhole had been created.\n When one story starts, then other media outlets grab hold of it and so it spreads very, very quickly. What actually happened is that a quantum computer is built and within this quantum computer you can do some calculations. Calculations that\n can be done with my iPhone. Because all the most powerful quantum computers today at most do calculations that can easily be done on my iPhone. You basically have something that represents the mathematics of a wormhole, but the way that\n The story was solved of course is that in doing this whatever calculation they did they had created the wormhole. This I saw in the same sense in which I could say look my children has built a rocket that goes to the moon.\n Wow, what kind of child you have. Yeah, here it is. And I show you a little sketch on a piece of paper when there is a drawing of a rocket going to the moon. You say, look. So what the quantum computer has done is exactly that.\n a little sketch of what could be perhaps a wormhole in some hypothetical theory which is probably wrong. Is this interesting? Yes, it is interesting because the fact that with quantum computers you can do these things means that quantum computers are\n So people get excited about that and then they go out and tell to the world, oh we've created a wormhole in a quantum computer. Over emphasizing wormhole, which probably don't exist.\n the theory being used of that, which is probably strong, and the utility of quantum computers, which is not yet there. So that's an example of bad communication, very bad communication. I was embarrassed, I was angry with my colleagues who did that. To me it looks like the\n The source of this problem is bad incentives. Scientists need to secure funding for their research, and increasingly, that depends on attracting public attention to their work.\n Universities seek to promote themselves, to attract students and bolster their\n Reputations. Press releases simplify and may overstate the research, and journalists just\n want to get as many clicks on their stories as they can. The end result of this incentivized game of telephone can be oversimplified, sensationalized headlines. Science that is just plain wrong. Now I myself have been guilty\n of overhyping a science story. Back in 2014, I made a video about the BICEP2 experiment. So this is one of the hugest discoveries in science of all time. Researchers reportedly detected polarization in the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n Allegedly, it was caused by gravitational fluctuations just a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. The result was considered the first real evidence of the quantum nature of gravity, and a smoking gun for inflation theory.\n even surprised Andrei Lind, one of the founders of inflation theory, with\n I believe in this just because it is beautiful.\" Unfortunately, further observations show that it was likely just dust in our own galaxy rather than primordial gravitational waves that created the polarization in the CMB.\n So, I took down my video. And to this day, I am wary about making videos about breaking science news. Like any type of breaking news, there is a high probability that early reports will turn out to be wrong. Just a few months ago, a paper was uploaded to the\n archive preprint server claiming to have discovered the first room temperature ambient pressure superconductor. This again triggered a flood of media attention.\n If the discovery were real, it would have been a big deal.\n It would revolutionize everything, right? Transmission of energy and that kind of stuff. The world would be different if it worked. But even before attempts to replicate the material and its properties failed, there were clear signs that the claim was false.\n In the only published plot showing resistivity versus temperature, the resistivity did not drop to zero as you'd expect at the supposed critical temperature. Instead, it continued to decrease below this value. Plus, the resistivity scale was given in units of 10\n to the minus 2 ohm centimeters. On that scale, any ordinary conductor would appear to have zero resistivity. Copper's resistivity, for example, is on the order of 10 to the minus 6 ohm centimeters. A video showed the material apparently levitating\n above a permanent magnet, in a supposed demonstration of the Meissner effect. But in that same video, the material also sticks to the magnet, something a superconductor would not do. And finally, there is this plot, showing that over the\n In the past hundred years, scientists have found new materials with progressively higher critical temperatures. But as of now, all the highest temperature materials only superconduct at very high pressures. For an ambient pressure room temperature superconductor,\n need a jump in critical temperature of around 125 degrees celsius. That's a lot. And this brings up the point that it is the most unexpected and surprising results that get the most attention. But it is also these very same results that\n are the most likely to be false. In social science, it's been shown that studies that later failed to be replicated receive on average 153 more citations than studies that can be replicated. Similar buzz surrounds faulty research in the\n The Italians, I'm Italian, came out announcing to the world some time ago that the neutrino was faster than light and then measured it. It turned out to be a plug that was not fitting well and so the entire machine was not working.\n When the truth is discovered, it rarely gets as much attention as the original finding.\n There is the apt saying, a lie can travel around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes. But that saying might need to be updated in the age of social media, when lies now have an even greater\n greater advantage. Do you think it's a bigger problem now than it used to be?\n discoveries can give people a false sense of how science works. Like, if that latest discovery I hear about turns out to be false, what else could be untrue?\n making bold, unsubstantiated claims also reduces trust in scientists.\n the conversation here is not just single pieces of news. I think there are entire fields which are hyped. Entire, wait, like entire fields of science that are hyped, but aren't really\n legit or like just they're all hot air or what? Oh no, they're not hot air. Fusion is like big in the news. People think it's close, right? There's startups, there's people getting billions of dollars. Exactly. I don't know where we are there. Again, it's\n not my field, but there was one particular announcement, what is it, one year ago? I remember this announcement, yeah. Scientists have produced a nuclear fusion reaction that created more energy than was expended, a breakthrough to tap\n into the same kind of energy that powers the sun and the stars. Simply put, this is one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century. Right?\n Which is bull**** again, because it is in the context of military research, nuclear energy\n basically for weapons, in a way of doing it which at present has no visible way of how to become an industrial way of producing energy.\n There's no way to scale it up. This is just lasers at a pellet. Just a little thing and then you compress it enormously and then basically it explodes because it's a mini nuclear explosion.\n you have more energy than the actual pressure energy that was needed to compress it. That's correct. But you need a huge amount of external energy for doing that. That was sold as a big step towards\n the solving the energetic problem of the world. But it's not. Back in 87, you know, fusion was already, people were talking about it like it's around the corner. We just need 20 years more work and we will crack it.\n And we have exactly the same story today with the current experiments. Something that is not overhyped is this video's sponsor, Shopify. And I would know because I've been personally using Shopify for eight years.\n Something a lot of people don't know about me is that before I was a YouTuber, I worked as a science teacher at a tutoring company in Sydney. But I was always frustrated by this misconception students had that bonds store energy. They don't.\n I decided to make a better version of the traditional ball and stick model of molecules. One where the atoms snap together magnetically. I came across these little ball magnets and in my first prototype I pushed them inside little styrofoam balls.\n and I learned about plastics and injection molding, ultrasonic welding, and I brought my invention Snatums to life. But one thing I had no clue about was how to run an online store, and that's where Shopify came in. They had\n Simple templates, so I set up the Snaddam store in just one day Shopify allowed me to process payments with hold appropriate state taxes and see everything that was happening with my store at a glance Plus it also integrates with lots of third-party apps and sites\n So for example, I could offer multiple different methods of shipping and this makes fulfillment a snap I also got set up for Google shopping right from within the app and it was simple to create Automated reminder emails like if someone forgets something in there\n their cart. The whole store runs with very little attention from me, which is great because I'm always working on the next video. So I think there is a reason that everyone is using Shopify for their online store or their side hustle, because it offers\n everything you could want, it's easy to use, and it's very affordable. I highly recommend Shopify to anyone who's thinking about starting a business, and for a free trial of Shopify, go to Shopify.com slash Veritasium. And now, back to science hype.\n Science is interesting in that you can divide it up into basically two categories. One is an established body of knowledge and the other is speculations, things that might be true but we don't really have any solid evidence for them yet.\n Because there can be an infinity of bad ideas and only one truth, most of these speculations are likely wrong. But the way certain topics are discussed in the media, it may be impossible to tell if they're part of the established body of knowledge or just very fanciful\n speculation.\n some success and some failures. And that's interesting. If you want to tell about this research, do tell about this research, but don't tell people that this is what we have\n learn about the world.\n the scientists, they may get the money or the attention. So I don't know, I'm kind of curious whether like a solution is possible. Yeah, I think there is one and it's exactly what you're doing.\n by talking about the fact that there is a risk of overhyping. If I can go out and say, oh, my quantum computer produced a wormhole, and nobody says anything, that's a problem.\n If we talk about the risk of hyping, if we talk about the risk of presenting ideas, theories, radical results, which are very, very tentative as solid, then we sort of immunize ourselves.\n against this danger. Science is not presented on the news like sport is presented on the news right. At the end of the news you get 10 minutes of sports where they will talk about the fact that somebody kicked a ball around in a field and it's not that particularly important so you get\n the full rundown of like lots of bits and pieces of what's going on. But to get a science story it has to be earth-shattering kind of thing. It has to be a big story. What many scientists would like is this larger picture of\n Well ultimately, almost everyone is in\n incentivized to sensationalize scientific findings. So I think it's important to remember that anytime you hear a science story on the news. Surprising, unexpected results that have not been independently replicated, they are more likely than not to be wrong.\n But despite this, I remain convinced that science is the best way to get at the truth. I mean, sure, in the short term, some may seek the spotlight by rushing the data analysis, overstating results, or circumventing peer review.\n long term, that is not going to win you the Nobel Prize. The bold claims, mistakes, and dead ends, they will fade into oblivion. And only sound science that is vigorously tested and independently validated, that is what\n makes it into the accepted body of knowledge.\n you"

He is simultaneously one of the most impactful and tragic scientists of all time.\n Perhaps, more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today.\n If you are an American citizen and you find an island with a lot of bird poop on it, well then you can claim that island for the United States and the US will have your back.\n The President is authorized to send in the Navy and the Army to defend your newly discovered poop-covered island. There are currently 10 American islands that were claimed in this way. And even though the law that\n made this possible was passed in 1856, it is still in effect to this day. So why did people want poop-covered islands so badly?\n There are a few dozen islands off the coast of Peru where millions of seabirds gather to mate. The waters near the island are full of fish. These millions of birds eat the fish and then they poop.\n Since the region is hot and dry, this poop solidifies and accumulates over millennia. There are cliffs of bird poop 30 meters or 100 feet high.\n Technically bird poop is called guano and by the mid 1800s buying and selling bird guano was big business. The price rose\n So why was there such a big market for bird poop? Well, to answer that, we have to look inside.\n inside the human body. By weight, most of our bodies are made up of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. But the fourth most common element is nitrogen. Nitrogen is part of the\n amino acids that form proteins, it's part of hemoglobin, the compound that carries oxygen in red blood cells, and it's a central component of DNA and RNA. Nitrogen is essential for all life on earth.\n We get our nitrogen by eating plants, or animals which have eaten plants. And plants get their nitrogen from the soil. The problem is, if you farm the same soil year after year, you harvest\n the nitrogen out of it. And eventually, there isn't enough nitrogen for healthy plants to grow. They can't produce enough chlorophyll to photosynthesize, which stunts their growth. Their leaves turn yellow, and they are more susceptible to pests\n and disease. Crucially for farmers, nitrogen deficiency means smaller yields. The way to fix this is to add nitrogen back into the soil, which is where bird guano comes in.\n Guano is up to 20% nitrogen. Hundreds of years ago, Incan farmers realized that adding guano to their soil made crops grow taller. This is what allowed them to grow food in places that were previously unfarmable.\n and expand their empire. South America's rich deposits of bird poop did not go unnoticed by the rest of the world. In 1865, Spain went to war against its former colonies of Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and\n for control of their guano-laden islands. But such was the world's appetite for nitrogen that by 1872, guano was running out and Peru banned further exports. The world would need another way\n way to get its nitrogen fix. This was a crisis. William Crookes, a British chemist, made a dire prophecy in 1898. With the world's growing population and dwindling\n supplies of nitrogen, he said, we stand in deadly peril of not having enough to eat. In less than 30 years' time, he argued, people all over the world will be dying of starvation. But he also proposed\n Because here's the thing. Nitrogen isn't\n rare, it's common. 78% of the air is nitrogen. But it's in a form that plants and animals can't use. Two atoms of nitrogen triple bonded together. This bond\n is one of the strongest in nature. The way to measure the strength of a chemical bond is by the amount of energy that's required to break it. So to break apart two chlorine atoms, for example, would take two and a half electron volts.\n To break apart two carbons requires 3.8 EV. Two oxygens, 5.2 EV. But to break apart two atoms of nitrogen requires 9.8 electron volts, a tremendous amount.\n I just want to interject to say that the molecular models in this video were actually invented by me. These are Snatoms, a product I kickstarted about eight years ago.\n where all the atoms snap together magnetically. So you can feel the attraction between atoms and hear the energy released when bonds form. The resulting molecules look and behave more like\n real molecules, and they are quicker and easier to form and break apart. Snatums are for sale on Amazon and snatums.com, so I will put some links down in the description. Now, this video is a repost.\n The original upload got over 14 million views and then suddenly it was age restricted and demonetized. But I think it's a really good video, so we're reposting it with the offending section removed. It's a reminder that you can't always\n count on YouTube monetization. So if you want to support these videos, please consider purchasing Snadams if you want some, or supporting us on Patreon. And now back to splitting nitrogen molecules.\n There are two processes that do this naturally. Lightning releases so much energy it breaks apart N2 into individual nitrogen atoms. They then\n quickly react to form nitrogen oxides. These molecules stay in the atmosphere until they react with water droplets in clouds and fall to the ground in rain. There are also a few types of bacteria,\n living in soil that can break the N2 bond using a tremendous amount of energy to do so. They make nitrogen available for plants. But bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly, and there's not enough lightening\n to produce nitrogen compounds at scale. So chemists tried.\n sound in guano. When that didn't work, he submerged the flask 300 meters underwater to increase the pressure. That didn't work either, but he was on the right track. Increasingly sophisticated versions of\n these experiments were carried out over the following hundred years. All of them failed. So when Fritz Haber became interested in this problem in 1904, he was joining a long line of failed chemists.\n He was 36 years old, working as a low-level academic at the University of Karlsruhe. He was also a new father, with a two-year-old boy named Herman and a wife, Clara, who was one of the first women to get a PhD in chemistry.\n Driven by pride and competition with another scientist, Haber spent five years on the problem. His idea was to combine nitrogen and hydrogen not only at high pressure, but also at high temperature, and in the presence\n of a catalyst, something that lowers the amount of energy required to split diatomic nitrogen. To do this, new experimental apparatus had to be invented. Haber worked tirelessly on this project, building equipment that could tolerate\n ever higher temperatures and pressures. He also got lucky. At the time, he was moonlighting as a technical consultant for a light bulb manufacturer. So there he had access to lots of really hard to find materials.\n like the element osmium. Osmium is rare. In his day, there was only about 100 kilograms of the refined metal in existence. But the company he worked for was experimenting with using it for filaments in their light bulbs.\n So they had most of the world's supply. Haber suspected it might make the perfect catalyst, so he brought a sample back to his lab. And there, in the third week of March, 1909, Haber placed his sheet\n of osmium in the pressure chamber. And then he pressurized and heated the nitrogen and hydrogen to 200 atmospheres and 500 degrees Celsius. Under these conditions, the triple bonds broke apart.\n and nitrogen reacted with hydrogen. Of the total gas mixture, 6% turned into ammonia. When the gas was cooled, 1 milliliter of ammonia dripped out the end of a narrow tube into a beaker.\n And the laided Haber rushed from one lab to another, yelling, come on down, there's ammonia! Germany's biggest chemical company, BASF, commercialized Haber's process. Within four years, they had opened\n opened a factory in Aupau, producing 5 tons of ammonia per day. People spoke of making bread from the air, with the fertilizer\n from this industrial process, on the same plot of land, farmers were able to grow four times as much food. And as a result, the population of the earth quadrupled. There's a good chance you owe your life to Hobbes\n invention. The earth supports 4 billion more people today than it could without nitrogen fertilizer. In fact, around 50% of the nitrogen atoms in your body came from the Haber process.\n process. The invention made Fritz Haber a wealthy man. He got a promotion, becoming the founding director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin.\n He also befriended some of the best scientists of his day, including Max Planck, Max Born, and Albert Einstein. After Einstein separated from his first wife in 1914, he stayed the night at Haber's house.\n If Haber was so well regarded, why was he shunned by colleagues when he won the Nobel Prize? Well, it all comes down to what happened in World War I. When the war broke out,\n Haber volunteered for military duty. Unlike pacifist Einstein, who denounced the war, Haber was a patriot. He wanted to use his expertise to help his country. Only a few months into the war, the German\n Army was already running out of gunpowder and explosives. Ammonium nitrate, besides being an excellent fertilizer, is also an explosive. Just look at what happened in Beirut in August of 2020.\n A warehouse containing almost 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire, and in the extreme heat, the fertilizer detonated.\n The blast, which could be heard hundreds of kilometers away, killed at least 217 people and injured thousands more. Seismometers registered an artificial earthquake measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale.\n This is just one of many fertilizer-related explosions. The opal plant where Haber's process was first put into practice would also explode in 1921. And the reason is nitrogen.\n We've already seen that it takes a tremendous amount of energy to break apart nitrogen's triple bond. But the flip side of that coin is that when two nitrogen atoms come together and form that bond, a huge amount of energy\n is released. The explosions of gunpowder, TNT, nitroglycerin, and ammonium nitrate all form diatomic nitrogen gas as a product. And the formation of that triple bond is where these chemicals\n derive much of their explosive energy. Haber lobbied to convert the factories using his process to make ammonia for fertilizer to create nitrate for explosives instead.\n is believed such a conversion to be impossible, but Haber persisted, and soon his chemical process was at the heart of the German war machine. From bread out of the air to bombs out of the air.\n But Haber thought chemistry could make an even bigger contribution to the war. In December 1914, he witnessed a chemical weapons test. He was unimpressed.\n Haber believed that he could do better. He set out to make a gas that was deadly at low concentrations and heavier than air so it would sink into enemy trenches. Projectiles carrying chemical weapons were banned\n and, at least in theory, by the Hague Convention of 1899. But in practice, after the start of the war, Germany, France, and Britain all experimented with chemical weapons. Haber converted his wing of the Institute into a\n chemical weapons laboratory, and after only a few months of work, he zeroed in on chlorine gas. An employee, Otto Hahn, expressed his discomfort about the new weapon. Haber told him,\n saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way. At 6pm on the 22nd of April, with the wind blowing toward the Allied trenches, German troops released a hundred and\n 68 tons of chlorine from over 5,000 gas cylinders. The wall of gas advanced across the battlefield. Since chlorine gas is two and a half times heavier than air, it sank into the\n trenches of the allied soldiers. Any soldier that inhaled a lungful of the gas suffered a terrible death. Chlorine irritates the mucus lining of the lungs so violently that they fill with liquid.\n The soldiers effectively drowned on dry land. More than 5,000 Allied soldiers died this way in the first attack.\n Haber was promoted to the rank of captain.\n 100,000 soldiers were killed by chemical weapons in World War I.\n When Germany surrendered, Haber was crushed. All the money he made from his ammonia patent was lost to hyperinflation. In an attempt to pay off Germany's crippling war debt, he tried to distill gold from seawater.\n But the project was futile. In 1933, the Nazis came to power and passed a law that all Jewish civil servants, including scientists, were to be fired from their jobs. Haber was Jewish, but he never\n practiced the religion, regardless his military service exempted him from the law. But he resigned from his role as director in solidarity with all the Jewish scientists who worked at the Institute. The next year,\n in a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland. He died of heart failure. Immediately after we\n World War I, Habers Institute developed a cyanide-based insecticide. It had a barely detectable odor, so they mixed in a foul-smelling chemical to alert people to the danger. The resulting gas was called\n Zyklon B. A decade after Haber's death, the Nazis requested chemists remove the foul-smelling component. And this form of Zyklon B, the chemical developed at Haber's Institute, was then\n used to perpetrate the Holocaust. Thinking about this story, it would be easy to paint Haber as a villain.\n as a hero, for inventing the process used to feed half the world. But another approach is to regard him as irrelevant to the larger story. Because someone else would have figured out a way\n way to process nitrogen out of the air. And other scientists were developing chemical weapons. Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably, but they have also\n given us ever-increasing ways to destroy ourselves. I think it'd be great to believe that we could ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity. But the reality is that every bit of\n information is a potential double-edged sword. You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used. Ammonium nitrate is both a fertilizer and an explosive.\n So the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?\n you"

            "transcription": "Can you just like yo-yo like a basic yo-yo? Yeah, you go like this. But this is not a basic yo-yo. No. Oh, yeah.\n That that is awesome ha Nicely done. This is Ben Conde. He's got a brand new channel on YouTube, which is about yo-yoing like a crazy\n person. But I'm gonna try to figure out how this is possible. How is it possible with a string that's not connected to the yoyo to get it to do all of these insane things.\n How did you learn to do that? That's crazy. It's a lot of like lonely Saturday nights. So watch this motion here, there, and then tug on it. Yeah, you got it. This is not gonna happen. You got it, dude.\n Pull up! Ooh, that was close. Tuck up! Pull up! There you go. This guy. So how does this work? When the yoyo is released, it unspools as it falls, gaining kinetic energy and rotational\n energy from the gravitational potential energy it had to start with. Yo-yos can spin really fast, around 6,000 revolutions per minute. That's about as fast as most car engines can turn over. And this is important because it gives the yo-yo gyroscopic\n stability, which means its axis of rotation is maintained even if there's a breeze or some little disturbances. Now since the yoyo has a lot of angular momentum, it continues spinning in the same direction. But when Ben tugs the string, he pulls it from one side of the yoyo over to the other.\n So now as the yoyo continues spinning, it binds the string to the spool and starts to roll up the string. If you look closely at this shot, you can actually see the exact moment when the string binds to the spool, preventing the yoyo from unraveling further and falling off the string.\n To release the yoyo, Ben throws it out and upwards without pulling back, so it completely unspools, and it\n continues spinning at the same high rate of rotation. But how does he catch it with just a string? So the way yo-yos actually do roll up is there's friction pads inside the yo-yo. These ones are made out of silicone. You see\n So if Ben can lodge the string in the gap of the yoyo, it catches on the friction pads and the yoyo starts to roll up the string again.\n Even without the friction pads, when the string wraps around the axle, it creates a significant amount of friction, in the same way that ropes wrapped around bollards hold big ships to their docks. The amount of tension a coiled rope or string can hold is given by the belt friction equation.\n This equation shows that the force the string can exert on the yoyo increases exponentially with the angle the string makes around the axle. So even a few turns around the yoyo allow Ben to pull it back into his hand. What is your favorite yoyo moment?\n My freestyle in 2011, the crowd stood up and it felt good. Brought tears in my eyes but I went back to my hotel room to cry because I was happy. It was a good moment. Awesome.\n Hey!

For example, researchers have asked authors of multi-author papers what percentage of the work they personally did. And when they add up those percentages, the sum is on average\n 140%. When couples are asked to estimate how much of the housework they do, the combined total is almost always over 100%. Now you might think this is because people want to appear more helpful than they actually are, but that's not\n When couples are asked what fraction of the fights they start or how much of the mess is theirs, the total is again over a hundred. People think they do more of the work, but they also think they cause more of the problems. So why is this? I think it's simply because you\n experience and remember vividly all of what you do, but not all of what everyone else does. So naturally you overestimate your own contributions and underestimate others. I think this bias leads us to underestimate the influence of other things on our lives like\n The role luck plays in our success. Take hockey players for example. If you ask a professional hockey player how they managed to reach the NHL, they might mention their hard work, determination, great coaches, their parents' willingness to get up at 5am and so on, but they probably\n won't acknowledge how lucky they were to be born in January. And yet in many years, 40% of hockey players selected into top tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter. An early birthday can make you up to four times\n likely to be a pro hockey player. And the reason for this disparity is presumably because the cutoff date for kids hockey leagues is January 1st. Those born in the first part of the year are a little older and so on average bigger and faster than kids in their league born late in the year.\n Now as they grow up, this difference should eventually shrink to nothing. But it doesn't. Because the young kids who show the most promise are given more time on the ice and enter more tournaments where they receive better coaching and improve their skills. And these advantages compound years of\n year after year, so by the time you get to the pros, birthdays are heavily skewed towards the start of the year. But does any professional hockey player feel thankful for their birthday? Probably not. And we are all like that, largely oblivious to the fortunate events that\n our success. Probably the most significant bit of luck many of us enjoy is being born into a prosperous country. Around half the variance in income received by people around the world is explained by their country of residence and that country's income distribution. If you were born in Burundi, for example,\n For example, which has the world's lowest gross national income per capita of just $730 a year, it doesn't matter how smart or hardworking you are, you're unlikely to earn much as an adult. Now, many people get offended if you point out how big a role chance plays in their success.\n To get it, if we are just a product of our circumstances, then our hard work and our talent seem to count for nothing. People think it has to be either skill or luck that explains success. But the truth is, you need both. Take these eight track and field world\n records. All the athletes who achieved these records are obviously world-class, extremely dedicated and talented, and yet when they achieved their world records, seven out of eight had a tailwind. Now these athletes all had the ability to win a gold medal, but to set the world record required\n The importance of luck increases the greater the number of applicants applying for just a few spaces. Consider the most recent class of NASA astronauts. From over 18,300 applicants in 2017,\n Only 11 were selected and went on to graduate from the astronaut training program. We can make a toy model of the selection process. Let's assume that astronauts are selected mostly based on skill, experience, and hard work, but also, say, 5% of the time.\n as a result of luck, fortunate circumstances. For each applicant, I randomly generated a skill score out of 100, and I also randomly generated a luck score out of 100. Then I added those numbers together, weighted in the 95 to 5 ratio,\n to get an overall score. This score represents the selectors judgments, meaning the top 11 by this metric would become astronauts. And I repeated this simulation a thousand times, representing a thousand different astronaut\n And what I found was the astronauts who were picked were very lucky. They had an average luck score of 94.7. So how many of the selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone? The answer is\n was on average only 1.6. That means, even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, 9 or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected would have been different if luck played no role at all.\n When competition is fierce, being talented and hardworking is important, but it's not enough to guarantee success. You also need to catch a break. Largely, I think we're unaware of our good luck because by definition it's not something we did. Like the housework\n done by your significant other, it goes unappreciated. And here's the crazy thing. Downplaying the importance of chance events may actually improve your probability of success. Because if you perceive an outcome to be uncertain, you're less likely to invest effort in it, which\n Welcome to Veritasium.\n an online science video blog.\n it makes it easier to accept inequality. In one experiment, participants were put in groups of three in small rooms to discuss a complex moral problem, and one person in each group was randomly designated the team leader. Half an hour later, the experiment\n So who got the extra cookie? In each case, it went to the team leader. Even though they had no special aptitude, they didn't have extra responsibilities and they'd gotten their position through chance alone. Once you have achieved a certain standard of responsibility, you can move on to the next step.\n status, it seems natural to feel like you deserve it and all the other good things that come your way. Now this is just an anecdote, but whenever I've been upgraded to fly a business class, I've always observed the worst behavior in my fellow privileged passengers. They just act so entitled\n and uncourteous. And research has found evidence for this as well. In another experiment, participants were asked to think of a good thing that happened to them recently. And then one group was asked to list their own personal qualities or actions that made that good thing happen. Another group was asked to list\n external factors beyond their control that led to the event and a control group was simply asked to list reasons why the good thing happened. Now for completing this task participants were told they would be paid a dollar but at the end they were offered the option to donate some or all of the money to a charity.\n Results showed those who listed their own personal attributes contributed 25% less than those who listed external factors beyond their control. Now think of what all this means for people in our society, specifically for people in positions of power like business\n business leaders and politicians. Undoubtedly, most of them are talented and hardworking, but they have also been luckier than most. And like most of us, they don't realize just how lucky they are. And this gives them a distorted view of reality. They're kind\n living in a form of survivor bias. All these leaders have worked hard and ultimately succeeded, so to them the world appears fair. In their experience, it rewards hard work. But what they don't have is the experience of all the people who have worked hard and failed.\n So what are they to make of people less successful than themselves? Well, the natural conclusion is that they must just be less talented or less hard-working. And this perspective makes them less inclined to be generous, to give back. And they are the ones who set the rules for how society operates.\n And this is particularly unfortunate since one of the main ways many of us are lucky is in our country of residence. But what is a country except for the things put there by people who came before? The roads and the schools, public transport, emergency services, clean air and\n water, everything like that. It seems a cruel trick of our psychology that successful people without any malice will credit their success largely to their own hard work and ingenuity and therefore contribute less to maintaining the very circumstances that made that success possible.\n The good news is that acknowledging our fortunate circumstances not only brings us more in line with reality, it also makes us more likeable. In a study where people had to read the transcript of a fictional 60 minutes interview with a biotech entrepreneur,\n Experimenters tried changing just the last paragraph where the interviewee is talking about the reasons for their company's success. In one version, the entrepreneur personally takes credit for the success they've had, but in the other, he says luck played a significant role.\n who read the luck version of the transcript, judged the entrepreneur as kinder, and thought they'd be more likely to be close friends with him than those who read the other version of the transcript. And raising our awareness of fortunate events can also make us happier, because it allows us to feel gratitude.\n Personally, I am grateful to Michael Stevens of Vsauce who on October 7th 2012 posted the video, How much does a shatter weigh? which shouts out my slow-motion slinky drop video and within three days my subscribers had increased by a third and within a month they had doubled.\n leading me to quit my part-time job and work exclusively on YouTube videos. And I'm grateful to the writer of the free newspaper they give out on the trains in Sydney who didn't quite understand electricity, leading me to post this picture of their article to my Instagram with the caption, what's wrong with this picture? And I'm lucky that the\n first person to answer correctly was a beautiful woman who became my future wife. Yep, that is how I met your mother. Now initially I wanted to make this video just to say our circumstances and psychology conspire to make us oblivious to our own\n own luck. This leads successful people to view the world as fair and those less successful than them as less talented or less hard-working. This is before you factor in any discrimination or prejudice. But it also became apparent to me that I should talk about what to do if you\n want to be successful in such a world. And I think the best advice is paradoxical. First, you must believe that you are in complete control of your destiny and that your success comes down only to your own talent and hard work. But second, you've\n You gotta know that's not true for you or anyone else. So you have to remember if you do achieve success that luck played a significant role and given your good fortune you should do what you can to increase the luck of others.\n Hey, so I had an idea for what I could do to increase the luck of others, and that is to give away 100 Snaddam's kits to people who couldn't otherwise afford them. So if you didn't know, Snaddam's is a product that I invented and kickstarted five years ago.\n molecular modeling kit where all the atoms snap together magnetically. Now I made it because I really wanted to tackle the misconception that bonds store energy. They don't. It takes energy to break them and you can feel that with snatoms.\n Recently I completely retooled snathams so there are small holes where the magnets are. This allows them to touch directly, increasing the bonding strength so you can form bigger, more stable molecules. I call these snathams X and yes they are\n backwards compatible with original Snadams. So here's my idea. For the next month, you can buy Snadams for 10% off using the code GIVELUCK. And for each one sold, I will give a kit to someone who can't afford one, up to a limit of a hundred. So I'll put links and more details in the description, and I really want to thank\n you for watching and thank you for all my good luck."

I think this bias leads us to underestimate the influence of other things on our lives like\n The role luck plays in our success. Take hockey players for example. If you ask a professional hockey player how they managed to reach the NHL, they might mention their hard work, determination, great coaches, their parents' willingness to get up at 5am and so on, but they probably\n won't acknowledge how lucky they were to be born in January. And yet in many years, 40% of hockey players selected into top tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter. An early birthday can make you up to four times\n likely to be a pro hockey player. And the reason for this disparity is presumably because the cutoff date for kids hockey leagues is January 1st. Those born in the first part of the year are a little older and so on average bigger and faster than kids in their league born late in the year.\n Now as they grow up, this difference should eventually shrink to nothing. But it doesn't. Because the young kids who show the most promise are given more time on the ice and enter more tournaments where they receive better coaching and improve their skills. And these advantages compound years of\n year after year, so by the time you get to the pros, birthdays are heavily skewed towards the start of the year. But does any professional hockey player feel thankful for their birthday? Probably not. And we are all like that, largely oblivious to the fortunate events that\n our success. Probably the most significant bit of luck many of us enjoy is being born into a prosperous country. Around half the variance in income received by people around the world is explained by their country of residence and that country's income distribution. If you were born in Burundi, for example,\n For example, which has the world's lowest gross national income per capita of just $730 a year, it doesn't matter how smart or hardworking you are, you're unlikely to earn much as an adult. Now, many people get offended if you point out how big a role chance plays in their success.\n To get it, if we are just a product of our circumstances, then our hard work and our talent seem to count for nothing. People think it has to be either skill or luck that explains success. But the truth is, you need both. Take these eight track and field world\n records. All the athletes who achieved these records are obviously world-class, extremely dedicated and talented, and yet when they achieved their world records, seven out of eight had a tailwind. Now these athletes all had the ability to win a gold medal, but to set the world record required\n The importance of luck increases the greater the number of applicants applying for just a few spaces. Consider the most recent class of NASA astronauts. From over 18,300 applicants in 2017,\n Only 11 were selected and went on to graduate from the astronaut training program. We can make a toy model of the selection process. Let's assume that astronauts are selected mostly based on skill, experience, and hard work, but also, say, 5% of the time.\n as a result of luck, fortunate circumstances. For each applicant, I randomly generated a skill score out of 100, and I also randomly generated a luck score out of 100. Then I added those numbers together, weighted in the 95 to 5 ratio,\n to get an overall score. This score represents the selectors judgments, meaning the top 11 by this metric would become astronauts. And I repeated this simulation a thousand times, representing a thousand different astronaut\n And what I found was the astronauts who were picked were very lucky. They had an average luck score of 94.7. So how many of the selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone? The answer is\n was on average only 1.6. That means, even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, 9 or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected would have been different if luck played no role at all.\n When competition is fierce, being talented and hardworking is important, but it's not enough to guarantee success. You also need to catch a break. Largely, I think we're unaware of our good luck because by definition it's not something we did. Like the housework\n done by your significant other, it goes unappreciated. And here's the crazy thing. Downplaying the importance of chance events may actually improve your probability of success. Because if you perceive an outcome to be uncertain, you're less likely to invest effort in it, which\n Welcome to Veritasium.\n an online science video blog.\n it makes it easier to accept inequality. In one experiment, participants were put in groups of three in small rooms to discuss a complex moral problem, and one person in each group was randomly designated the team leader. Half an hour later, the experiment\n So who got the extra cookie? In each case, it went to the team leader. Even though they had no special aptitude, they didn't have extra responsibilities and they'd gotten their position through chance alone. Once you have achieved a certain standard of responsibility, you can move on to the next step.\n status, it seems natural to feel like you deserve it and all the other good things that come your way. Now this is just an anecdote, but whenever I've been upgraded to fly a business class, I've always observed the worst behavior in my fellow privileged passengers. They just act so entitled\n and uncourteous. And research has found evidence for this as well. In another experiment, participants were asked to think of a good thing that happened to them recently. And then one group was asked to list their own personal qualities or actions that made that good thing happen. Another group was asked to list\n external factors beyond their control that led to the event and a control group was simply asked to list reasons why the good thing happened. Now for completing this task participants were told they would be paid a dollar but at the end they were offered the option to donate some or all of the money to a charity.\n Results showed those who listed their own personal attributes contributed 25% less than those who listed external factors beyond their control. Now think of what all this means for people in our society, specifically for people in positions of power like business\n business leaders and politicians. Undoubtedly, most of them are talented and hardworking, but they have also been luckier than most. And like most of us, they don't realize just how lucky they are. And this gives them a distorted view of reality. They're kind\n living in a form of survivor bias. All these leaders have worked hard and ultimately succeeded, so to them the world appears fair. In their experience, it rewards hard work. But what they don't have is the experience of all the people who have worked hard and failed.\n So what are they to make of people less successful than themselves? Well, the natural conclusion is that they must just be less talented or less hard-working. And this perspective makes them less inclined to be generous, to give back. And they are the ones who set the rules for how society operates.\n And this is particularly unfortunate since one of the main ways many of us are lucky is in our country of residence. But what is a country except for the things put there by people who came before? The roads and the schools, public transport, emergency services, clean air and\n water, everything like that. It seems a cruel trick of our psychology that successful people without any malice will credit their success largely to their own hard work and ingenuity and therefore contribute less to maintaining the very circumstances that made that success possible.\n The good news is that acknowledging our fortunate circumstances not only brings us more in line with reality, it also makes us more likeable. In a study where people had to read the transcript of a fictional 60 minutes interview with a biotech entrepreneur,\n Experimenters tried changing just the last paragraph where the interviewee is talking about the reasons for their company's success. In one version, the entrepreneur personally takes credit for the success they've had, but in the other, he says luck played a significant role.\n who read the luck version of the transcript, judged the entrepreneur as kinder, and thought they'd be more likely to be close friends with him than those who read the other version of the transcript. And raising our awareness of fortunate events can also make us happier, because it allows us to feel gratitude.\n Personally, I am grateful to Michael Stevens of Vsauce who on October 7th 2012 posted the video, How much does a shatter weigh? which shouts out my slow-motion slinky drop video and within three days my subscribers had increased by a third and within a month they had doubled.\n leading me to quit my part-time job and work exclusively on YouTube videos. And I'm grateful to the writer of the free newspaper they give out on the trains in Sydney who didn't quite understand electricity, leading me to post this picture of their article to my Instagram with the caption, what's wrong with this picture? And I'm lucky that the\n first person to answer correctly was a beautiful woman who became my future wife. Yep, that is how I met your mother. Now initially I wanted to make this video just to say our circumstances and psychology conspire to make us oblivious to our own\n own luck. This leads successful people to view the world as fair and those less successful than them as less talented or less hard-working. This is before you factor in any discrimination or prejudice. But it also became apparent to me that I should talk about what to do if you\n want to be successful in such a world. And I think the best advice is paradoxical. First, you must believe that you are in complete control of your destiny and that your success comes down only to your own talent and hard work. But second, you've\n You gotta know that's not true for you or anyone else. So you have to remember if you do achieve success that luck played a significant role and given your good fortune you should do what you can to increase the luck of others.\n Hey, so I had an idea for what I could do to increase the luck of others, and that is to give away 100 Snaddam's kits to people who couldn't otherwise afford them. So if you didn't know, Snaddam's is a product that I invented and kickstarted five years ago.\n molecular modeling kit where all the atoms snap together magnetically. Now I made it because I really wanted to tackle the misconception that bonds store energy. They don't. It takes energy to break them and you can feel that with snatoms.\n Recently I completely retooled snathams so there are small holes where the magnets are. This allows them to touch directly, increasing the bonding strength so you can form bigger, more stable molecules. I call these snathams X and yes they are\n backwards compatible with original Snadams. So here's my idea. For the next month, you can buy Snadams for 10% off using the code GIVELUCK. And for each one sold, I will give a kit to someone who can't afford one, up to a limit of a hundred. So I'll put links and more details in the description, and I really want to thank\n you for watching and thank you for all my good luck."

            "transcription": "As of today, I have been making YouTube videos full-time for 10 years. So to celebrate, I am answering your questions. Plus, I'm giving away items like\n like this beautiful spinning top from Vorso and other items from my videos. So if you want to win one of those, then write down the characters that will appear randomly in the top right corner of this video. Those will be your password to the\n form in the description. So let's get into it. Why did you start doing YouTube? Because I always wanted to be a filmmaker. As a kid, I loved\n doing plays and musicals. I had the most fun of my life when I was working with creative other people, but I always thought that a career in the traditional film or TV industry was a terrible idea and like your\n was out of your control. It seemed to rely on a big break. I don't think those industries were meritocracies. So for basically my whole life until I was 28 I did the safe thing and I studied engineering and physics and did a PhD in physics\n and then I taught people physics and I love science but I also love just the craft of putting together a film or a video and sending it out into the world and I think this makes a lot of sense because I like\n learning about science and I liked performing and that is exactly what making YouTube videos allows me to do. You know, the process of doing science is very different from the process of learning science. And so I think it's not surprising that this is the thing that I love about\n more than being a scientist. I have been on YouTube for 10 years and it was starting to show. There was so much gray in my beard that I'm shaving it off to wind back the clock.\n I am giving away this fully specced 2017 MacBook Pro. I use this to make a lot of my videos, but those are all wiped off here now, so it's just a nicely specced laptop that you could use to make more videos if you\n wanted. Any advice you have for people coming out of high school or college and unsure how to take their first steps? The key is just start doing it. After making my YouTube channel for a few months,\n I sort of snuck into a science awards in Sydney in Australia and there I found sort of the executive producer of the only science show on Australian television and I got his business card.\n the very next day I emailed him and I sent him links to all of the videos or you know the videos I was most proud of anyway and I didn't really expect to hear anything but three weeks later I got an email back from him and he was like these are really good why don't you come in and we'll have a\n chat. And I think the key to that interaction was I had stuff to show him. I didn't go to him and say, hey, I'd love to be involved in your TV program. You know, what can I do for you? What do you need done? You know, I came to him and I said, that's what\n I'm capable of and if that's of interest to you then great. I have literally thousands of Penrose tiles that I will be sending out if you want them. I'm giving these away. I will send you 21\n and then 13 darts of another color. What has been the hardest part of your YouTube journey? I would say the\n beginning, you know, everything's like a snowball. It's always hardest to make the snowball when it's small and I know that there were a number of times when I thought that I would just quit doing YouTube because it seemed like I was getting\n traction. I think the other problem with the beginning was I wasn't very good at YouTube. I wasn't very good at presenting to a camera. I wasn't very good at picking topics. Most people know how to tell apart a hard-boiled egg\n from a raw egg? Well you're gonna find out pretty quick if you break the shell. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think I was lucky not to know how bad I was because otherwise I really would have stopped in the early days.\n I am giving away these Ames windows all lovingly handcrafted by me painstakingly over hours and hours colored in beautiful GoPro Hero 4 still works\n little old. Do your kids watch your videos? Some of them. Their favorites are the one where daddy quote blasts off into space and also the one where the meteor\n or hits the earth. I actually feel like the kids are a good barometer of what's gonna be successful. It's like if it appeals to their two and four year old brains, then it will appeal to all of us in some way. I'm giving away these astronaut\n What was the most humbling response you got from the audience and for which video?\n Depends on what you mean by humbling in like Brady Heron has ruined this word for me But if you mean like the most overwhelming positive response that I've gotten You know, I would say I did this video on the bullet block\n years ago and there were over a hundred video responses which just totally blew me away. The one-way speed of light video got a huge response from people. There's over 50,000 comments on that video.\n Not to mention the hundreds of emails I received and the tweets and it's incredible to have hundreds and thousands of people thinking about science and the fundamental way that the universe works.\n I am delighted that you guys are with me. What do you do apart from YouTube? Well, I have three kids and they take up most of the time\n outside of when I'm doing YouTube videos. So that's it. I'm a YouTuber and a dad, which is pretty great. I love going to the beach. I love hiking up the hill. I love riding our bikes. I'm a pretty simple guy and\n 2020 has made things even simpler because there was really nothing we could do. The last shade balls. All right. What would you say was the hardest part of your PhD? Okay, so the hardest part of a PhD is that it's the\n this research degree, right, which maybe is stating the obvious. When I got into it, I remember talking to someone who had recently finished their PhD and she told me a PhD is a dark time in most people's lives. And I was like, what\n I get myself into. But I realized what she meant because for three or four years I was kind of on this roller coaster. The problem with research is you never quite know what you're doing. That's the point of research and you never quite know what you're gonna find.\n find. So there's a big risk that it's all gonna be worthless, that you're gonna spend six months or a year or many years, depending on your field, working on something and only to find out that it didn't work or it's not gonna happen\n And for me, that is a very hard thing to do. I feel like my personality is not built for that kind of research because I need sort of to regularly achieve things and to feel like I'm doing practical things and having a practical impact on\n the world. What was the best part of it? Getting to meet lots of academics and talk to different people. My thesis supervisor, Manju Sharma, was fantastic and I learned a ton about academia and about research and about writing\n It was a real nice shift for me to go into a PhD that was not solely focused on math, you know, coming out of engineering physics. It was nice to be focused on something that involved words and writing and reading and I realized, oh, that whole area of life\n life has been kind of shut off to me as an engineering student. So that was a nice transition. Well, I gotta say that was having more people than just my thesis reviewers, which are three people, read my thesis.\n And the reason for it was I went out and made videos, you know, about my PhD research. And it's funny that a YouTube video is the thing that these days can get your thesis or your papers more citations and better read.\n In 2010, I made this short video for TEDx in Sydney and I initially shot it like talking to camera and when I got home all the footage was corrupted and I couldn't use it. It was the night before the submission deadline and so\n So I drew stick figures in paint. Ask almost anyone about physics and chances are they will tell you they don't like it, don't get it, or it's just not their thing. And I feel like that's still one of my the best things that I've done which is like\n There are tons of times when it seems like you should be discouraged and throw in the towel, but I did not. I just made do with the crappy tools that I had, and frankly I think the video was better with the stupid stick figures than it would have been with the talking head.\n Okay, the garage gets full of stuff. These are boxes of the Snadam's expansion kit and I want to sign them and send them out to teachers.\n So teachers, use your school emails in the form and I will send you one of these if you're lucky. Okay, lightning round. Why does Veritasium have 42 mass number? Because that's the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe\n and everything from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. How are you doing? Well, what's your favorite ice cream flavor? Pistachio or rocky road. Do you truly love turbulent flow or do you just fake it for the internet? Merch? I don't have any. Would you like some? Did you\n learn any Portuguese with your wife? Um pukedinho. She hates the way I say bacalhau. I find it impossible. Science or maths? Science. Do you miss Canada? Yes. Today especially. Favorite Shrek character? Shrek. Is a hot dog\n sandwich? How much do you love science? To the moon and back. How many hours of sleep do you get? Not enough. Not enough. If not YouTube, what would you be today? I think probably a teacher of some sort, maybe a professor.\n How big is your team? Because the production value of your videos has been so awesome these days. Well, thank you for noticing and yes, there has been a team being built. Johnny Hyman who can animate, edit, write music.\n write programs. He's also working on a channel of his own called Verse. You should check it out. My wife Raquel is frequently behind the camera. I'm so incredibly appreciative of that. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Ivan Tello is my animator.\n He's been doing lots of great work in all sorts of different styles. Peter Lebedev, who's been helping me with research and writing and doing everything that possibly needs doing. My former professor of general relativity at the University of Sydney, Geraint Lewis, has been an advisor on many\n of these videos. A huge thank you to Alice for managing everything that's happening in Chinese Veritasium. There's Veritasium dubbed in Spanish, in Arabic, in Russian. We're working on a Veritasium Hindi. And I gotta say, paying people would\n not really be possible without the sponsors. So I gotta say thank you for being okay with it because that's what allowed me to have a rocket built or build an eight foot tall optical illusion. Those are things I just never would have dreamed of doing in the past because my investment in\n every video was essentially only my time and now I feel like I can try lots of different things. So this is a Q&A video but the final cue is for you which is what do you want to see more of on this channel in 2021?\n and in the future. What have you enjoyed the most in the past? I just want to know what I can do for you. What is the thing that really adds the most value to your life? That's it for me. I guess thank you. Seriously.\n Thank you."

            "transcription": "These are shade balls. They're being dumped into this water reservoir in Los Angeles. And contrary to what you may have heard, their main purpose is not to\n reduce evaporation. So what are they really for? To find out, I'm visiting the largest collection of these balls anywhere on earth at LA Reservoir.\n 96 million shade balls. That's correct. 96 million. It's very rare for you to see 96 million of anything. This is your life vest which you are required to wear.\n Throw a leg over and climb on in any way you can. Looking at this, I had so many questions. Like, why are they black? Are they safe to have\n in drinking water? How much do they cost? Do they actually reduce evaporation? And what is their real purpose? Is it hard to drive in shade balls? It is very hard.\n Why is that? These are actually partially filled with water and the reason they're filled with water is that at LA Reservoir we have some really high winds and so you know if we didn't put water in these things there'd be ball\n But that makes them significantly more difficult to push out of the way, especially when they form\n close-packed crystal-like structures. Behind the boat, the balls quickly come together in our wake, and some, close to the motor, are pulled along with the boat.\n Wow. Did you, what did you think the first time they suggested doing this or when it first came in? Yeah.\n it was a little out there. Did you think they were nuts? No, not nuts. Well, it just like it looks absurd. It's like we're in the world's biggest ball pit. Right. Yeah, that's what it looks like. Yeah, you can't tell by standing here that we're actually floating over\n I think it's probably 40 40 feet right here 40 50 feet deep below us and We can't even see any water You'd think it was a joke right like if you didn't know you'd be like no you're not that's\n A green screen or something, right? Yeah, it's fake. So like when I switch on my tap at home, is the water coming from here? Yes. Sometimes. Or always. Most of the time. Most of the time. Most of the time the water is coming from here.\n Absolutely nuts. So why is LA Reservoir covered in shade balls? Well the problem all started with bromide. Bromide is a naturally occurring substance. It's associated with salt water and so normally places like the\n California aqueduct that comes down from the Delta you get some saltwater intrusion she has some bromide in the water. Bromide is harmless and it's almost impossible to remove. But when you disinfect the water with ozone that bromide becomes bromate.\n and bromates carcinogenic. And so around the year 2000 they wrote regulations regulating bromate and the regulations basically said if you have a treatment plant that uses ozone then you have to watch your bromate formation and be careful not to form too much. So the only place\n we ever measured bromate was at our filter plant. And the results were always within the 10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators. So they were confused when they got a call from one of their customers, a beverage company in LA. They said we have some really high levels of bromate showing\n But between the filtration plant and the customer was the reservoir. So they did some tests.\n out that bromide with chlorine, which was supposed to be safe, in bright sunlight formed bromate even more than ozone did. And so we made this unfortunate scientific discovery that actually was not part of any regulatory scheme. And so here we are\n the reservoir. We have water source that's got bromide in it, harmless. We have chlorine, we have to have the disinfected water. And we have sunlight because it's open. The only choice we have is to remove sunlight. So we looked at all sorts of things. We looked at floating tarps across the\n the water and normally you put a floating cover on the water but that's a multi-year project. And so we said well can we manufacture these kind of trampolines with poly like TVC pipe and we said well they just gonna become bird perches and we'll have a big water quality problem. And so then we knew we had\n high density polyethylene pipe which is used in the water industry and we know that it floats. We at one point thought about can we get to float a pile of pipe across the surface. Well that's hard to do and very expensive because there's a lot of material. So maybe we can take some pipe and run it through a chipper and we can make a\n debris field across the surface, like the back corner of a lake somewhere. But then they have all this mushy warm water with plastic floating on the top. That sounds like a petri dish. And so lo and behold, Dr. Brian White did some research and he found the shade bulb.\n Except they weren't called shade balls at the time. This product existed and they were called bird balls and they used it on ponds that had mine tailings where they didn't want waterfowl to go and get poisoned.\n and also around airports where there were ponds and they wanted to keep the waterfowl off so that they didn't take off and get into jet engines. You know they'd actually done wind tunnel testing and they had you know blew 50-60 mile-hour winds across as they see how\n they behave but they're really made to deter birds and wildlife from sitting on the water! Did there used to be birds landing here more? Like... Absolutely! Yeah? Yeah! Once we deployed these balls all the birds were gone! They used to just hang out right loiter at the curbs! Yeah\n they'd be all over the top of the dam, they'd be down at the the outlet tower, they'd be everywhere but we don't get them anymore like we used to. But before being added to the reservoir, the shade balls had to be tested. Would they actually reduce the formation of\n bromate. So the reason shade\n balls are black is to block all light from reaching the water and triggering the bromate reaction. The black pigment is also safe for contact with drinking water and it's stable even exposed to the elements for years. They're black for a reason so you know they're made out of\n high density polyethylene. It's the same material that like a gallon milk jug is made out of. It's a food grade plastic and they would be clear like milk carton except that they wouldn't last in the sun. And so they have a material called carbon black in there and that's what makes the the plastic last\n for at least 10 years out in the sun. We did test to see if there's any other colors we could use. So we actually had the company make three different shades of blue but the dyes were so unstable they said we can't guarantee it's gonna last more than a year. And so it's that carbon black that's the\n powder in this that really makes this product last in the sunlight. One of the concerns that people raised to me when we first put these on was that are they going to get hot and then leach material out? And they don't. They're totally inert. I mean theoretically you can cut off pieces of this ball and you can chew it\n No harm comes to you. This is totally food grade. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. What's it like driving through these things? It's difficult. As you can see, we've been sitting here for quite a while and there's a breeze and we haven't moved. I mean, anybody that knows\n that's been on a boat in a lake, if there's a slight breeze and you're on a boat, you're drifting, right? Not here, this thing, they're just stable. It's interesting, when you try to pilot the boat through these things, it's difficult. It's like driving through peanut butter or something. Something, I guess.\n blocking sunlight from the reservoir also provided additional benefits.\n where if we had an algae outbreak, you might actually, if you filled a bathtub up, it might have a slight tinge of green. I mean it may be healthy to drink, but it might have a slight tinge of green from the algae. You can see a bit of algae. Yeah, and it's just coloring the water. That no longer occurs. So with the sunlight gone, the algae\n But the big concern I had was evaporation.\n When I first heard about these black plastic balls reducing evaporation, it didn't seem to make any sense. I mean, wouldn't they absorb more energy and so heat up the water, leading to faster evaporation? It turns out the answer is no for a number of reasons.\n In an open reservoir, there is more exposed surface area where water molecules can escape into the air. Plus, there is greater airflow over the water surface, continually removing the layer of moist air and replacing it with drier air, increasing evaporation.

            "transcription": "As of today, I have been making YouTube videos full-time for 10 years. So to celebrate, I am answering your questions. Plus, I'm giving away items like\n like this beautiful spinning top from Vorso and other items from my videos. So if you want to win one of those, then write down the characters that will appear randomly in the top right corner of this video. Those will be your password to the\n form in the description. So let's get into it. Why did you start doing YouTube? Because I always wanted to be a filmmaker. As a kid, I loved\n doing plays and musicals. I had the most fun of my life when I was working with creative other people, but I always thought that a career in the traditional film or TV industry was a terrible idea and like your\n was out of your control. It seemed to rely on a big break. I don't think those industries were meritocracies. So for basically my whole life until I was 28 I did the safe thing and I studied engineering and physics and did a PhD in physics\n and then I taught people physics and I love science but I also love just the craft of putting together a film or a video and sending it out into the world and I think this makes a lot of sense because I like\n learning about science and I liked performing and that is exactly what making YouTube videos allows me to do. You know, the process of doing science is very different from the process of learning science. And so I think it's not surprising that this is the thing that I love about\n more than being a scientist. I have been on YouTube for 10 years and it was starting to show. There was so much gray in my beard that I'm shaving it off to wind back the clock.\n I am giving away this fully specced 2017 MacBook Pro. I use this to make a lot of my videos, but those are all wiped off here now, so it's just a nicely specced laptop that you could use to make more videos if you\n wanted. Any advice you have for people coming out of high school or college and unsure how to take their first steps? The key is just start doing it. After making my YouTube channel for a few months,\n I sort of snuck into a science awards in Sydney in Australia and there I found sort of the executive producer of the only science show on Australian television and I got his business card.\n the very next day I emailed him and I sent him links to all of the videos or you know the videos I was most proud of anyway and I didn't really expect to hear anything but three weeks later I got an email back from him and he was like these are really good why don't you come in and we'll have a\n chat. And I think the key to that interaction was I had stuff to show him. I didn't go to him and say, hey, I'd love to be involved in your TV program. You know, what can I do for you? What do you need done? You know, I came to him and I said, that's what\n I'm capable of and if that's of interest to you then great. I have literally thousands of Penrose tiles that I will be sending out if you want them. I'm giving these away. I will send you 21\n and then 13 darts of another color. What has been the hardest part of your YouTube journey? I would say the\n beginning, you know, everything's like a snowball. It's always hardest to make the snowball when it's small and I know that there were a number of times when I thought that I would just quit doing YouTube because it seemed like I was getting\n traction. I think the other problem with the beginning was I wasn't very good at YouTube. I wasn't very good at presenting to a camera. I wasn't very good at picking topics. Most people know how to tell apart a hard-boiled egg\n from a raw egg? Well you're gonna find out pretty quick if you break the shell. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think I was lucky not to know how bad I was because otherwise I really would have stopped in the early days.\n I am giving away these Ames windows all lovingly handcrafted by me painstakingly over hours and hours colored in beautiful GoPro Hero 4 still works\n little old. Do your kids watch your videos? Some of them. Their favorites are the one where daddy quote blasts off into space and also the one where the meteor\n or hits the earth. I actually feel like the kids are a good barometer of what's gonna be successful. It's like if it appeals to their two and four year old brains, then it will appeal to all of us in some way. I'm giving away these astronaut\n What was the most humbling response you got from the audience and for which video?\n Depends on what you mean by humbling in like Brady Heron has ruined this word for me But if you mean like the most overwhelming positive response that I've gotten You know, I would say I did this video on the bullet block\n years ago and there were over a hundred video responses which just totally blew me away. The one-way speed of light video got a huge response from people. There's over 50,000 comments on that video.\n Not to mention the hundreds of emails I received and the tweets and it's incredible to have hundreds and thousands of people thinking about science and the fundamental way that the universe works.\n I am delighted that you guys are with me. What do you do apart from YouTube? Well, I have three kids and they take up most of the time\n outside of when I'm doing YouTube videos. So that's it. I'm a YouTuber and a dad, which is pretty great. I love going to the beach. I love hiking up the hill. I love riding our bikes. I'm a pretty simple guy and\n 2020 has made things even simpler because there was really nothing we could do. The last shade balls. All right. What would you say was the hardest part of your PhD? Okay, so the hardest part of a PhD is that it's the\n this research degree, right, which maybe is stating the obvious. When I got into it, I remember talking to someone who had recently finished their PhD and she told me a PhD is a dark time in most people's lives. And I was like, what\n I get myself into. But I realized what she meant because for three or four years I was kind of on this roller coaster. The problem with research is you never quite know what you're doing. That's the point of research and you never quite know what you're gonna find.\n find. So there's a big risk that it's all gonna be worthless, that you're gonna spend six months or a year or many years, depending on your field, working on something and only to find out that it didn't work or it's not gonna happen\n And for me, that is a very hard thing to do. I feel like my personality is not built for that kind of research because I need sort of to regularly achieve things and to feel like I'm doing practical things and having a practical impact on\n the world. What was the best part of it? Getting to meet lots of academics and talk to different people. My thesis supervisor, Manju Sharma, was fantastic and I learned a ton about academia and about research and about writing\n It was a real nice shift for me to go into a PhD that was not solely focused on math, you know, coming out of engineering physics. It was nice to be focused on something that involved words and writing and reading and I realized, oh, that whole area of life\n life has been kind of shut off to me as an engineering student. So that was a nice transition. Well, I gotta say that was having more people than just my thesis reviewers, which are three people, read my thesis.\n And the reason for it was I went out and made videos, you know, about my PhD research. And it's funny that a YouTube video is the thing that these days can get your thesis or your papers more citations and better read.\n In 2010, I made this short video for TEDx in Sydney and I initially shot it like talking to camera and when I got home all the footage was corrupted and I couldn't use it. It was the night before the submission deadline and so\n So I drew stick figures in paint. Ask almost anyone about physics and chances are they will tell you they don't like it, don't get it, or it's just not their thing. And I feel like that's still one of my the best things that I've done which is like\n There are tons of times when it seems like you should be discouraged and throw in the towel, but I did not. I just made do with the crappy tools that I had, and frankly I think the video was better with the stupid stick figures than it would have been with the talking head.\n Okay, the garage gets full of stuff. These are boxes of the Snadam's expansion kit and I want to sign them and send them out to teachers.\n So teachers, use your school emails in the form and I will send you one of these if you're lucky. Okay, lightning round. Why does Veritasium have 42 mass number? Because that's the answer to the ultimate question of life the universe\n and everything from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. How are you doing? Well, what's your favorite ice cream flavor? Pistachio or rocky road. Do you truly love turbulent flow or do you just fake it for the internet? Merch? I don't have any. Would you like some? Did you\n learn any Portuguese with your wife? Um pukedinho. She hates the way I say bacalhau. I find it impossible. Science or maths? Science. Do you miss Canada? Yes. Today especially. Favorite Shrek character? Shrek. Is a hot dog\n sandwich? How much do you love science? To the moon and back. How many hours of sleep do you get? Not enough. Not enough. If not YouTube, what would you be today? I think probably a teacher of some sort, maybe a professor.\n How big is your team? Because the production value of your videos has been so awesome these days. Well, thank you for noticing and yes, there has been a team being built. Johnny Hyman who can animate, edit, write music.\n write programs. He's also working on a channel of his own called Verse. You should check it out. My wife Raquel is frequently behind the camera. I'm so incredibly appreciative of that. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Ivan Tello is my animator.\n He's been doing lots of great work in all sorts of different styles. Peter Lebedev, who's been helping me with research and writing and doing everything that possibly needs doing. My former professor of general relativity at the University of Sydney, Geraint Lewis, has been an advisor on many\n of these videos. A huge thank you to Alice for managing everything that's happening in Chinese Veritasium. There's Veritasium dubbed in Spanish, in Arabic, in Russian. We're working on a Veritasium Hindi. And I gotta say, paying people would\n not really be possible without the sponsors. So I gotta say thank you for being okay with it because that's what allowed me to have a rocket built or build an eight foot tall optical illusion. Those are things I just never would have dreamed of doing in the past because my investment in\n every video was essentially only my time and now I feel like I can try lots of different things. So this is a Q&A video but the final cue is for you which is what do you want to see more of on this channel in 2021?\n and in the future. What have you enjoyed the most in the past? I just want to know what I can do for you. What is the thing that really adds the most value to your life? That's it for me. I guess thank you. Seriously.\n Thank you."

            "transcription": "These are shade balls. They're being dumped into this water reservoir in Los Angeles. And contrary to what you may have heard, their main purpose is not to\n reduce evaporation. So what are they really for? To find out, I'm visiting the largest collection of these balls anywhere on earth at LA Reservoir.\n 96 million shade balls. That's correct. 96 million. It's very rare for you to see 96 million of anything. This is your life vest which you are required to wear.\n Throw a leg over and climb on in any way you can. Looking at this, I had so many questions. Like, why are they black? Are they safe to have\n in drinking water? How much do they cost? Do they actually reduce evaporation? And what is their real purpose? Is it hard to drive in shade balls? It is very hard.\n Why is that? These are actually partially filled with water and the reason they're filled with water is that at LA Reservoir we have some really high winds and so you know if we didn't put water in these things there'd be ball\n But that makes them significantly more difficult to push out of the way, especially when they form\n close-packed crystal-like structures. Behind the boat, the balls quickly come together in our wake, and some, close to the motor, are pulled along with the boat.\n Wow. Did you, what did you think the first time they suggested doing this or when it first came in? Yeah.\n it was a little out there. Did you think they were nuts? No, not nuts. Well, it just like it looks absurd. It's like we're in the world's biggest ball pit. Right. Yeah, that's what it looks like. Yeah, you can't tell by standing here that we're actually floating over\n I think it's probably 40 40 feet right here 40 50 feet deep below us and We can't even see any water You'd think it was a joke right like if you didn't know you'd be like no you're not that's\n A green screen or something, right? Yeah, it's fake. So like when I switch on my tap at home, is the water coming from here? Yes. Sometimes. Or always. Most of the time. Most of the time. Most of the time the water is coming from here.\n Absolutely nuts. So why is LA Reservoir covered in shade balls? Well the problem all started with bromide. Bromide is a naturally occurring substance. It's associated with salt water and so normally places like the\n California aqueduct that comes down from the Delta you get some saltwater intrusion she has some bromide in the water. Bromide is harmless and it's almost impossible to remove. But when you disinfect the water with ozone that bromide becomes bromate.\n and bromates carcinogenic. And so around the year 2000 they wrote regulations regulating bromate and the regulations basically said if you have a treatment plant that uses ozone then you have to watch your bromate formation and be careful not to form too much. So the only place\n we ever measured bromate was at our filter plant. And the results were always within the 10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators. So they were confused when they got a call from one of their customers, a beverage company in LA. They said we have some really high levels of bromate showing\n But between the filtration plant and the customer was the reservoir. So they did some tests.\n out that bromide with chlorine, which was supposed to be safe, in bright sunlight formed bromate even more than ozone did. And so we made this unfortunate scientific discovery that actually was not part of any regulatory scheme. And so here we are\n the reservoir. We have water source that's got bromide in it, harmless. We have chlorine, we have to have the disinfected water. And we have sunlight because it's open. The only choice we have is to remove sunlight. So we looked at all sorts of things. We looked at floating tarps across the\n the water and normally you put a floating cover on the water but that's a multi-year project. And so we said well can we manufacture these kind of trampolines with poly like TVC pipe and we said well they just gonna become bird perches and we'll have a big water quality problem. And so then we knew we had\n high density polyethylene pipe which is used in the water industry and we know that it floats. We at one point thought about can we get to float a pile of pipe across the surface. Well that's hard to do and very expensive because there's a lot of material. So maybe we can take some pipe and run it through a chipper and we can make a\n debris field across the surface, like the back corner of a lake somewhere. But then they have all this mushy warm water with plastic floating on the top. That sounds like a petri dish. And so lo and behold, Dr. Brian White did some research and he found the shade bulb.\n Except they weren't called shade balls at the time. This product existed and they were called bird balls and they used it on ponds that had mine tailings where they didn't want waterfowl to go and get poisoned.\n and also around airports where there were ponds and they wanted to keep the waterfowl off so that they didn't take off and get into jet engines. You know they'd actually done wind tunnel testing and they had you know blew 50-60 mile-hour winds across as they see how\n they behave but they're really made to deter birds and wildlife from sitting on the water! Did there used to be birds landing here more? Like... Absolutely! Yeah? Yeah! Once we deployed these balls all the birds were gone! They used to just hang out right loiter at the curbs! Yeah\n they'd be all over the top of the dam, they'd be down at the the outlet tower, they'd be everywhere but we don't get them anymore like we used to. But before being added to the reservoir, the shade balls had to be tested. Would they actually reduce the formation of\n bromate. So the reason shade\n balls are black is to block all light from reaching the water and triggering the bromate reaction. The black pigment is also safe for contact with drinking water and it's stable even exposed to the elements for years. They're black for a reason so you know they're made out of\n high density polyethylene. It's the same material that like a gallon milk jug is made out of. It's a food grade plastic and they would be clear like milk carton except that they wouldn't last in the sun. And so they have a material called carbon black in there and that's what makes the the plastic last\n for at least 10 years out in the sun. We did test to see if there's any other colors we could use. So we actually had the company make three different shades of blue but the dyes were so unstable they said we can't guarantee it's gonna last more than a year. And so it's that carbon black that's the\n powder in this that really makes this product last in the sunlight. One of the concerns that people raised to me when we first put these on was that are they going to get hot and then leach material out? And they don't. They're totally inert. I mean theoretically you can cut off pieces of this ball and you can chew it\n No harm comes to you. This is totally food grade. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. What's it like driving through these things? It's difficult. As you can see, we've been sitting here for quite a while and there's a breeze and we haven't moved. I mean, anybody that knows\n that's been on a boat in a lake, if there's a slight breeze and you're on a boat, you're drifting, right? Not here, this thing, they're just stable. It's interesting, when you try to pilot the boat through these things, it's difficult. It's like driving through peanut butter or something. Something, I guess.\n blocking sunlight from the reservoir also provided additional benefits.\n where if we had an algae outbreak, you might actually, if you filled a bathtub up, it might have a slight tinge of green. I mean it may be healthy to drink, but it might have a slight tinge of green from the algae. You can see a bit of algae. Yeah, and it's just coloring the water. That no longer occurs. So with the sunlight gone, the algae\n But the big concern I had was evaporation.\n When I first heard about these black plastic balls reducing evaporation, it didn't seem to make any sense. I mean, wouldn't they absorb more energy and so heat up the water, leading to faster evaporation? It turns out the answer is no for a number of reasons.\n In an open reservoir, there is more exposed surface area where water molecules can escape into the air. Plus, there is greater airflow over the water surface, continually removing the layer of moist air and replacing it with drier air, increasing evaporation. Now the shade balls do\n do absorb more energy and get hotter on top, but the bottom of the balls stays cool. Plus the balls contain mostly air, which is a good thermal insulator, and so not much of the heat is transferred through to the water. It's almost like a double pane window, you get that air gap in there, and the air\n So for all of these reasons, shade balls reduce evaporation\n by 80 to 90 percent. That's pretty significant for a dry climate like Los Angeles. How much do they cost? These run about around three for a dollar. I think we paid 33, 34 cents a piece, something that range. So and they and they actually\n you'll have a salvage value, not that much, but if we go to remove them, they're recyclable material. But we figured that over the life of the balls between the savings in chlorination, the chemical savings, and the savings in evaporation,\n Probably at least half the cost of the balls will be paid for and so I mean of course the water quality benefit is immeasurable But even the balls themselves will save money doing what they do Do you ever bring people out here for tours? You're the first one. Why am I the first one to get to go on a tour?\n tour here. To get this level of detail tour, yes. This is so cool. I've heard something about hexagonal balls.

            "transcription": "Climate change is boring. Don't get me wrong, it's incredibly important. It's just that the story of climate change is not especially compelling. And that's when the carbon dioxide concentration reached 400 parts.\n When I started making this video, I thought that everyone knew the story. But apparently I was wrong. What do you feel about climate change? So I think Australia is the most affected by the climate change. That's because\n I'd rather say the ozone layer, the hole in the ozone layer, I think, I reckon, yeah. And whereas before there used to be a natural layer up there that blocked things, that layer seems to be getting...\n The ozone layer and therefore our seasons are changing. The hole in the ozone layer is causing a problem. Yeah. Okay, the hole in the ozone layer is a problem, but it's not a major cause.\n of climate change. To recap, we are burning fossil fuels, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which traps slightly more thermal energy, causing the overall temperature of the planet to rise. Have you changed anything about your life because climate change is happening?\n I recycle now. We recycle more. We recycle a lot in England. In England. Oh yeah, we do more things like recycling. We've got some recycling. Recycling, recycling plastic and paper. Just putting plastic in the right bin and paper in the right bin and stuff like that.\n Okay, again, recycling is very important, but it's not really going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which come mainly from energy use and transportation. So what I've learned is lots of people don't know how climate change works and don't know what to do about it.\n What's worse is there's so much confusion that some people don't think humans are responsible.\n Here's the thing. The vast majority of climate scientists agree that climate change is happening and that humans are playing a significant role. But the public doesn't see this broad consensus because, well, there are arguments made to the contrary by businesses with\n invested interests. Those who stand to lose if a price is put on carbon. Now these people will make up stories, whatever they want. Things like Al Gore and his pals just invented climate change in order to make themselves rich\n and famous. Meanwhile, the scientists respond with carefully worded predictions.\n This is why scientists have had such a tough time informing the public about climate change. It's much easier to tell a compelling story if you can make up whatever you want than if you have to stick to the truth.\n is like Armageddon. Just instead of a giant earth-crushing asteroid, it's slightly more of an invisible odorless gas. And instead of the imminent destruction of the planet, it's a gradual warming over decades. See,\n Our brains are well adapted to deal with clear and present danger. They're not so good at handling complex long-term probabilistic forecasts, which is kind of why we have governments. They're meant to act in our best interests, especially in the case\n of complex long-term problems. And in fact last year the Australian government implemented a carbon tax, which seemed to be working great. It was reducing carbon emissions. And then this year they repealed that carbon tax, the first government in the world to do something like that. And my question\n Question is why? You know, there is a UN climate summit coming up next month and you can actually win a trip to go there and ask your questions to the world leaders. If you're between the ages of 13 and 21, head over to askwhyynot.org where you can\n I mean, the real reason I find climate change boring is because we know what the problem\n is. The science is well established and the solutions are fairly obvious and yet action is not being taken. So if you feel like I do, perhaps you should take some action and maybe we can change this story and\n make it a little bit more interesting.\n It really opened my eyes because I really thought we already all knew the facts, but clearly we don't So maybe we need to spend more time educating the people around us"

I've made this video and Destin has made a video on Smarter Every Day and we want you to play them both at the same time. So there's a link to his video down in the description. Find a way to load both of these videos\n videos, and then synchronize them on my mark in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n In the Australia we are at 34 degrees south latitude. Which is the opposite side of the world from Huntsville, Alabama? So, which way did the toilets flush? That is the question.\n The Simpsons did a whole episode based on toilets flushing the opposite direction in on\n Australia. Plus, other shows have supposedly demonstrated this effect.\n So is this a real effect or not? The application of this principle to draining water in Earth's two hemispheres is just bunk.\n If you try it yourself, you'll find inconsistent results. This sink sometimes drains one way and sometimes the other way.\n In any container of water there's always going to be some rotation. The water is not perfectly still. And it is this, rather than the hemisphere, that determines which way the water will swirl down the drain.\n But what if we could eliminate all motion from the water?\n here a 5 foot wide kiddie pool. I actually filled the pool in the anti-clockwise direction to be sure\n that any clockwise motion we see is not due to the way I fill the pool. I've left this water sitting here for 24 hours so it seems like I've damped all of the motions from the fill\n I really hope this works. Destin, wish me luck.\n I'm about to pull the plug. Three, two, one. And the pool is draining. But you can't see any motion of the water just yet.\n To help us see where the water is flowing, I'm going to put some food coloring in on the four cardinal directions around the pool.\n You can clearly see that the water is flowing clockwise in this direction and\n And that makes sense because that's how it should flow in the southern hemisphere due to the Earth's rotation.\n But you can see what a tiny little effect it is and what extraordinary lengths I had to go to to see this effect. So really you're not going to see it in a bathtub and you're not going to see it in a sink or in a toilet because there are other sources of angular momentum that totally wash\n out this effect. The Coriolis Effect! There you have it! It works! To understand how it works, imagine a pool with one edge touching the south pole.\n The pool is stationary relative to Earth, but every day it's actually completing one full revolution. Now you can see the side of the pool furthest from the pole travels much farther every\n day than the side right next to the pole. So the outer side of the pool is moving fastest towards the east, and as you get closer to the pole,\n the velocity decreases down to zero. Now imagine we drain the pool. Water from the far side is moving too fast\n relative to the drain and so it gets out ahead, whereas water from near the pole is going too slow and so it lags behind.\n So when the water approaches the drain, it swirls clockwise. And this is the reason cyclones swirl clockwise in the southern hemisphere.\n The higher pressure air rushes into the eye of the storm and just like in our pool, swirls in the direction dictated by the hemisphere. And that's the truth about\n toilet swirl.\n Subscribe to Destin. Run everyday. Okay. Yep, you're here.\n That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna subscribe to Veritasium and Mass because it's an awesome channel. Oh, it's- oh look! Where's the subscribe button? But seriously, have you subscribed to Sm-\n every day yet, Destin has made some of the best videos on the internet, like the backwards bicycle, Prince Rupert's drop, and what it looks like to get a tattoo in slow motion. Now I've been friends with Destin for about three years and I'm pretty much convinced that the man is superhuman.\n Not only does he run a remarkably successful YouTube channel, he also has a wife and four kids, and he has a full-time job. The man is literally a rocket scientist, and he's friends with astronauts, and when he asks them questions,\n They answer him from space. This man deserves your subscription. If you're not subscribed to him already, I don't know what you've been doing with your life, but go over to his channel right now and subscribe to Smarter Every Day and trust me,\n me, you will thank me later. And I want to thank you for watching. You know, we have been working on this collaboration for about three years and it feels so good to have it finally out there in the world. I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed making it. Alright,\n All right, I'll see you next time.\n you"

            "transcription": "This is the challenge of a YouTuber, which is pushing that record button and actually filming something because you never know, are people going to hate it? Is it good enough? Have you thought through what you're going to say? I have not thought through what I'm going to say.\n Okay, so I want to talk about the question of why is it that right now when it is really easy to get access to facts and information where you can just pull up your phone and look up anything and\n the world. Why is it now that we have the most access to facts? Do facts mean the least? This is what I want to know. Why does fake news spread now? Why are we more polarized now than ever before?\n And what I have to kind of admit to you is that I was a real optimist. Maybe I was naive about the internet, but my thinking about having an international communication system whereby anyone\n anywhere can share anything and anyone anywhere regardless of say their education background or their class standing can get access to real information through Wikipedia, okay? My thinking was the internet was going to make everyone happier.\n and more informed, more educated, and probably more tolerant of others around them. And the reason why I think that the internet should make people more tolerant is because it should expose people\n to people who are not like them. Right? I mean is this crazy? My thinking is that as we have a platform to communicate with each other, people in diverse places, people with different interests from us, and we all\n had the ability to sort of debate and agree upon what is true we all would become more accepting of the facts. Maybe I'm ranting on about this too much. Is this too much?\n the internet would make the world more\n connected, more tolerant, more educated, and more true, like more agreed upon the facts and the way things are. And for a while, I think there were signs that this was happening.\n There was the Arab Spring where people in countries that had been kind of dictatorships or people who've been oppressed were rising up. There was the approval of gay marriage in a number of countries. There were agreed upon climate agreements that seemed to suggest the whole international community was coming together.\n There are things like my YouTube channel where there can be four million people who can watch or subscribe to a channel that's about information and about learning new things about the universe, right? The whole rise of\n smart content on YouTube I took as an indication that things were going in the right direction. That here we can get communities together who are all interested in the same sort of in the same\n quite high level phenomena. You know, the same like if I made a TV show, I could never convince anyone to make an episode about interpretations of quantum mechanics. I could never convince someone to make a video\n about pilot wave theory and go in as much depth as I went into in my videos. But on the internet you can find that audience because you can aggregate across the whole world. So little niche audiences across every country can all\n come together and say, you know, we want to learn this and we can support this sort of enterprise. You guys in agreement? Okay, now here's the problem. What I didn't think about was that\n Other communities can form. Communities where people have particular agendas, ideological or religious, or people with extreme biases. Normally, they are not much of a force to reckon with because they are dilute in our population.\n But on the internet, just like the people who love physics, people who hate science or people with differing ideologies and people who are intolerant can find each other and they can come together into these camps. So I think that's true.\n starts to suggest why we have the problem that we have today. And then, what do people do once they've found their communities, once they've found their people? Well, we have meetups, but we also, we share things with each other online.\n And you can think about some communities that are really innocuous like the communities of people who are cat lovers who love sharing like pictures of kittens and then someone gets the idea to write like a really cute phrase like I can has cheeseburger on a picture of a kitten and then\n And then that little image tickles our brains in a way that is really strong and really incredible and then that spreads throughout the internet. And what you have in essence is kind of evolution taking place, an evolution of ideas on the internet.\n And so I guess what I mean is, you know, one person can post this picture of a cat and then people can vary the phrases that are on it and the best phrase is going to win out and get itself replicated and shared across the web more than any other.\n And the same thing happens with ideological arguments, right? If there's some sort of debate that's happening on the internet, different versions of arguments can pop up. And when you think about two groups on the internet debating, they're not really\n debating each other. Each community creates what they think the opponent's argument is. And then people within that community can tweak that argument to make it worse and worse and worse, to make it the most obvious\n version of itself that pushes our buttons and when it pushes our buttons then we share it with everyone we know and we say look at what the other side is talking about look at how how awful it is and and we keep evolving the ideas to make\n them really, really bad. Those are the ones that get shared and spread just like in evolution. We're evolving arguments to make them the worst form of themselves and then to make the pushback even worse.\n And that, I think, is leading to this polarization. And what's worse, the internet is organized by algorithms. Algorithms that are designed to take the things that are most engaged with.\n most push our buttons that get us going and get us sharing and liking or hating and they promote those even further. And this I think is where something like fake news comes in. How is it possible\n that during the last election cycle in the US, more fake news was spread and shared than real news. That is extraordinary. And I think it happens because the internet allows groups of people to come together\n who have really particular views, it allows them to share things with each other, even sharing what they think the opponent's argument is, tweaking it ever so slightly, doing all of these little mutations, little alterations, and finding the ones that push our buttons the most. And then those are\n the ones that get shared, those are the ones that get liked and hated and everything, and those are the ones the algorithm elevates to the very top. So rather than the internet bringing us together, rather than us converging around the facts, instead the internet\n allows us to divide ourselves into factions and to have this crazy evolution of arguments which is facilitated by the algorithms pushing us ever further apart.\n And that is the best that I've been able to reason about why we now care less about facts than we ever did before. Because deep down each one of us is\n based on confirmation bias, we naturally go out into our world and we seek things that agree with what we think rather than looking for things that disagree with what we think. That's an innate human trait as you can see\n in my video, can you solve this? So it's upsetting and I think we need to find a way to overcome this division and find a way to agree again.\n on what is truth and what is not. Thank you.\n Alright, alright. So, questions? Anyone want to question or comment? We have a gentleman down the front. Yes? You know that term has a word, cyber-vulcanization. I learned it from Vsauce. Very useful term. Say it again. Cyber-vulcanization? Vulcanization.\n I don't know what Balkanization is.\n cyber balkanization yeah yeah shout out to CGP Grey's video here yes this idea that you should\n You should think of your opinions like papers in a box. And if you find another opinion that is better than the opinion that you have in the box, you should switch it out. You should not believe as you are not your opinions. Your opinions are just like stuff you carry with you.\n and that should be easily changed. So we have this mechanics that evolves\n strong ideas that polarize people. Do you think there's a way to utilize this mechanic to make the internet better, to bring us all together, to not being pushed around but by utilizing it to\n Better stuff. Right. I mean, I personally think that the mechanics that's brought us here to division is not in its current form going to lead us to convergence. So I think something has to change about the mechanics. And if I think about one of these options,\n Who was saying about the idea of being the paper and you should really swap them out? That's a very sophisticated, mature idea. It's very sophisticated and mature to think that we can have our beliefs set down and then when they get challenged we can think about them\n and swap them out for new ones. That's not something that humans like to do. It's hard. I was recently in the Netherlands and the guy who was driving this van, we were going around shooting a TV series, the guy was driving the van, talked to me about\n electric cars. And he was saying to me, Derek, you know that even if you get like a low emissions or zero emissions car, an electric car, half of the emissions of any vehicle come from the production of the vehicle in the first place. So really, if you think you're cutting down a lot of\n the emissions of your vehicle by getting an electric car, which full disclosure I do have. He's saying you're not really dramatically decreasing the emissions because still half the emissions happen when the car was made. So a better strategy\n then buying all electric cars would be to not buy any cars at all and just keep driving your cars a few years longer because that's going to save a lot more because you know a lot of the waste is up front and I did not believe him. I was like that is crazy half the emissions half like I know it's hard to make a car\n But half the emissions and you think it's gonna drive for you know hundreds hundreds of thousands of kilometers and I went and I looked it up and it was true and I take his piece of paper and I swap it in and I move mine out\n But I think it's a really hard thing to do and it's something that I felt repulsed by. I didn't want to swap my piece of paper out. That's why I think I don't know that that can be the solution wholesale because we can't just say to\n Everyone, hang on. A lot of you have beliefs that are not true. Can we just swap some paper out with you? They'll say, no, that's my paper. So I was going to say, to me, the thing that needs to change, I would say, is some of the systems.\n and particularly the algorithms. Because I think Facebook, and I think they are looking at this now, needs to figure out a way not to elevate fake news, but to let it languish and promote real news. They have a responsibility because they are curating the feeds\n If you are determined to find the real news, do you\n You go out on a marathon of research and usually you dig deeper and deeper past the sort of junk that's being catered to us by the algorithms. But what you're essentially proposing is some sort of a lie detector to be implemented in algorithms.\n That's kind of hard to do, right? Unless it's manually altered by companies like Facebook. I don't think you can manually alter the algorithm. I think you have to find a way and I think the algorithms can be made. I think it's a big challenge. I agree with you.\n think\n And these signals that separate what's a valuable site, what's a site that people appreciate and seems to be linked into a whole bunch of other sites, which are all part of a factual web, right? And I think that similarly Facebook needs to do something like that, where in\n they look for signals of truth. I agree, very hard, and it's going to be a constant battle, but I think you need to look for the signal of truth rather than just the signal of what pushes people's buttons. Yeah?\n If you look back at the stone age, if you had a weird opinion and you were in your little tribe, either you convinced everyone or you changed your mind. So Facebook is kind of like our tribe. Some people use Facebook\n You don't say, no, you're wrong. I'm not going to talk to you anymore. Because he's your friend.\n So either you change your mind or you convince the other person, right? But if you go on Reddit, you're not going to convince 10 million billion people. So, yeah, I don't know. Maybe like, if you've ever tried the controversial tab on Reddit,\n That's usually where some of the most interesting discussions are, but yeah, sometimes it's not so fun. And I think this brings me to one of my kind of points that I think is a little bit counterintuitive, and it's a point that's difficult for me to think about. I'm still not\n settled on this idea, but I wonder if sometimes that arguing just makes things worse. You know, and as someone who makes science films, I wonder, like, if I go out and make a film about something that's controversial, I don't know if maybe I'm just making it worse.\n And so I think we all have to think about that really carefully before we engage in discussions, which is, is there a chance by making these points which you think are really clear and really get at the truth, is it possible that you were just causing the other side to be more deeply entrenched in their beliefs and their\n first place. Down here, yep.\n that what's uncontroversial will likely seem true. Yeah, I get you there. As I say, I don't know the solution. I think it is hard, but I do think we have to figure it out. I think that there are\n places on the web that have a good record of truth. Wikipedia, for example, for all of its ability to be edited is still more likely than not to be true. So I think there's all these places that do signal true things. I think, you know, CNN is\n more likely to be true than Breitbart News. So, I mean, there has got to be some signal in the noise, some way to trace back references and things, right? Some of the things we talked about were, you know,\n Some of the things we talked about were manual intervention or deeply searching, right? Going back and looking at all these different sources. That's something that most humans don't do and won't do and can't do, don't have the time to do.\n That's why I'm saying a machine can look at references. A machine can look at signals that spread, you know, and they can do that very rapidly. So you want to find out who are these people? Do they have a record of, you know, falsity? Are they actually accredited?\n There are traditional news media that may\n present the news or these articles, fake or not, to the public, don't you think they sort of have part of the blame because they\n They fact checked those fake articles when the results already were in. Like all these statements were said and then when the results were in, say in the last election,\n they just went, oh wait, these statements, were they true? Oh wait, they weren't, but too late to alter the results from false statements. Yeah, but I think there was a lot of live fact-checking, but it didn't seem to do anything like that.\n people didn't seem to care about facts. And that deep down is the real question I want to get the answer to, which is like, why don't people seem to care what's true? And I guess maybe rather than putting it that way, there were different\n which each had their own narratives and their own things that they believed was true and that was different from the other side. And so figuring out what true was was really hard, especially if you were completely in one camp. I mean, there were there were a few\n fake things around on both sides."

Yeah?\n If you look back at the stone age, if you had a weird opinion and you were in your little tribe, either you convinced everyone or you changed your mind. So Facebook is kind of like our tribe. Some people use Facebook\n You don't say, no, you're wrong. I'm not going to talk to you anymore. Because he's your friend.\n So either you change your mind or you convince the other person, right? But if you go on Reddit, you're not going to convince 10 million billion people. So, yeah, I don't know. Maybe like, if you've ever tried the controversial tab on Reddit,\n That's usually where some of the most interesting discussions are, but yeah, sometimes it's not so fun. And I think this brings me to one of my kind of points that I think is a little bit counterintuitive, and it's a point that's difficult for me to think about. I'm still not\n settled on this idea, but I wonder if sometimes that arguing just makes things worse. You know, and as someone who makes science films, I wonder, like, if I go out and make a film about something that's controversial, I don't know if maybe I'm just making it worse.\n And so I think we all have to think about that really carefully before we engage in discussions, which is, is there a chance by making these points which you think are really clear and really get at the truth, is it possible that you were just causing the other side to be more deeply entrenched in their beliefs and their\n first place. Down here, yep.\n that what's uncontroversial will likely seem true. Yeah, I get you there. As I say, I don't know the solution. I think it is hard, but I do think we have to figure it out. I think that there are\n places on the web that have a good record of truth. Wikipedia, for example, for all of its ability to be edited is still more likely than not to be true. So I think there's all these places that do signal true things. I think, you know, CNN is\n more likely to be true than Breitbart News. So, I mean, there has got to be some signal in the noise, some way to trace back references and things, right? Some of the things we talked about were, you know,\n Some of the things we talked about were manual intervention or deeply searching, right? Going back and looking at all these different sources. That's something that most humans don't do and won't do and can't do, don't have the time to do.\n That's why I'm saying a machine can look at references. A machine can look at signals that spread, you know, and they can do that very rapidly. So you want to find out who are these people? Do they have a record of, you know, falsity? Are they actually accredited?\n There are traditional news media that may\n present the news or these articles, fake or not, to the public, don't you think they sort of have part of the blame because they\n They fact checked those fake articles when the results already were in. Like all these statements were said and then when the results were in, say in the last election,\n they just went, oh wait, these statements, were they true? Oh wait, they weren't, but too late to alter the results from false statements. Yeah, but I think there was a lot of live fact-checking, but it didn't seem to do anything like that.\n people didn't seem to care about facts. And that deep down is the real question I want to get the answer to, which is like, why don't people seem to care what's true? And I guess maybe rather than putting it that way, there were different\n which each had their own narratives and their own things that they believed was true and that was different from the other side. And so figuring out what true was was really hard, especially if you were completely in one camp. I mean, there were there were a few\n fake things around on both sides."

            "transcription": "This video is about learning styles. What kind of learner are you? Oh yeah, I'm a visual person. So like I can see things. I think visual learning. I mean like I remember formulas like auditory. I need to be like interacting with the material. I like to learn by doing myself.\n There is this idea in education that everyone has their own preferred way of learning, their so-called\n learning style. If information is presented in accordance with the learning style, then they'll learn better. Now there are dozens of different learning style theories, but the most common one identifies four main learning styles. Visual, auditory, reading, writing, and kinesthetic.\n or VARC for short. Visual learners learn best from images, demonstrations, and pictures. Auditory learners learn best from listening to\n an explanation. Reading-writing learners learn best from reading and writing. And kinesthetic learners learn best\n by doing, physically interacting with the world.\n say anything while you're looking at them and at the end of the 10 you tell me how many you can remember. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now learning styles make intuitive sense because we know everyone is different. Some people have better spatial\n It sort of very much fits with a broad strain of thought in the recent western tradition,\n we're all unique, we're all different, and so you don't want to say like everybody learns the same way. That sort of conflicts with our feelings about what it means to be human. So doesn't it make sense that people should learn better in their own preferred learning style? Well teachers\n Teachers certainly seem to think so. A survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK and the Netherlands found that over 90% believed that individuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style. Just like every professor has a different style of teaching,\n But when his teacher starts using visuals, Jonathan finds it easier to focus and understand the material. So he might be a visual learner.\n Sometimes I need to learn something, sometimes I need to draw it, or I need to write it down, or I need to see a picture or a movie. For example, science classes, I get bored easily just listening and I think it's more interesting for me to actually be able to do it.\n I don't. I just assumed. To take advantage of learning styles, then teachers need to do two things. First, identify the learning style of each of their students. And second, teach each student in accordance with their learning style.\n On the VARC website it says, once you know about VARC, its power to explain things will be a revelation. But before you take an online learning styles quiz, it's a good idea to ask, do learning styles even exist? I mean, do you have one?\n And if you're taught in accordance with it, would you learn better? Well, you could test this by running a randomized control trial, where first you would identify learners with at least two different learning styles, say visual and auditory.\n Then randomly assign the learners to one of two educational presentations, one visual, one auditory. So for half of the students, the experience will match their learning style, and for the other half, it won't. And then you give everyone the same test.\n If the learning style hypothesis is correct, the results should show better performance when the presentation matches the learning style than when they're mismatched. I tried a very unscientific version of this experiment on the street. For some people,\n I matched their learning style, so I showed visual learners pictures of 10 items. But for other visual learners, I read out the items instead. Bell, penguin, sun.\n I'm maxed out. How many can you remember? I don't know. Hair, knife, duck, heart, butterfly. Apple, bicycle, guitar. There's a spider. Did I say eye already?\n Trumpet, pear, butterfly, knife, boat, heart. I couldn't tell you the rest, that's all I got. Most people could remember only about five or six things. Six, six is not bad. Six.\n But a few could remember substantially more, say eight or nine items. Bug? I don't know if I said bug. A guitar, a bike, eye, bell.\n But the reason didn't seem to be because the presentation matched their preferred learning style.\n But because they employed a memory strategy.\n This is obviously anecdotal evidence, but rigorous studies like the one I outlined have\n been conducted. For example one looked at visualizers versus verbalizers instead of visual versus auditory learners. This study was computer-based so first students learning styles were assessed using questions like would you rather read a paragraph or\n or see a diagram describing an atom. The researchers also provided some challenging explanations with two buttons, visual help or verbal help. The visual one played a short animation, whereas the verbal help gave a written explanation. From these\n measures combined, the researchers categorized the students as either visualizers or verbalizers. And then the students were randomly assigned to go through a text-based or picture-based lesson on electronics. When a student hovered their mouse over keywords in the lesson,\n In the text-based group, a definition and clarification came up, but in the picture group, an annotated diagram was shown instead. And after the lesson, the students did a test to assess their learning. The students whose preferred learning style matched their instruction\n performed no better on the tests than those whose instruction was mismatched. The researchers ran the test again with 61 non-college-educated adults and found exactly the same result. But learning styles are a preference, so how strongly\n do learners stick to their preference? In a 2018 study, during the first week of semester, over 400 students at a university in Indiana completed the VARC questionnaire, and they were classified according to their learning style. Then at the end of the semester, the same students\n completed a study strategy questionnaire. So how did they actually study during the term? Well, an overwhelming majority of students used study strategies which were supposedly incompatible with their learning style, and the minority of students who did, did not\n perform significantly differently on the assessments in the course.\n I decided to try to solve this puzzle. There are of course many reasons for what I observed, but one topic that seemed to hold some magic, some explanatory power, was preferred by\n modes of learning, modal preferences. And thus, Vark was born. There was no study that revealed students naturally cluster into four distinct groups, just some magic that might explain why some teachers can reach students while others can't.\n But how can this be? If we accept that some people are more skilled at interpreting and remembering certain kinds of stimuli than others, like visual or auditory, then why don't we see differences in learning or recall with different presentations? Well, it's because what we\n actually want people to recall is not the precise nature of the images or the pitch or quality of the sound, it's the meaning behind the presentations. There are some tasks that obviously require the use of a particular modality. Learning about music, for example, should have an auditory\n Similarly, learning about geography will involve looking at maps. And some people will have greater aptitude to learn one task over another. Someone with perfect pitch, for example, will be better able to recall certain tones in music. Someone with excellent visual skills will be able to do the same.\n spatial reasoning will be better at learning the locations of countries on a map. But the claim of learning style theories is that these preferences will be consistent across learning domains. The person with perfect pitch should learn everything better auditorily. But that is\n Review articles of learning styles consistently conclude there is no credible evidence that learning styles exist. In a 2009 review, the researchers\n The contrast between the enormous popularity of the learning styles approach within education and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is, in our opinion, striking and disturbing. If classification of students learning styles has practical utility,\n it remains to be demonstrated.\n One of the reasons many people find learning styles so convincing is because they already believe it to be true. For example, they might already think that they're a visual learner, and then when a teacher shows them a diagram of say, a bike pump, and suddenly the concept\n clicks? Well, they interpret this as evidence for their visual learning style. When in reality, that\n So if learning styles don't\n improve learning, then what does? Well there's a large body of literature that supports the claim that everyone learns better with multimodal approaches, where words and pictures are presented together rather than either words or pictures alone. Now there's going to be words as well as the picture.\n We're gonna see if this is any better. This is known as the multimedia effect, and it explains, in part, at least, why videos can be such powerful tools for learning, when the narration complements the visuals. Duck.\n In my PhD research, I found explicit discussion of misconceptions was essential in multimedia teaching for introductory physics.\n Ultimately, the most important thing for learning is not the way the information is presented, but what is happening inside the learner's head. People learn best when they're actively thinking about the material, solving\n problems, or imagining what happens if different variables change. I talked about how and why we learn best in my video, The Science of Thinking, so check that out. Now the truth is, there are many evidence-based teaching methods that improve learning. Learning styles\n is just not one of them and it is likely given the prevalence of the learning styles misconception that it actually makes learning worse. I mean learning styles give teachers unnecessary things to worry about and they may make some students reluctant to\n engage with certain types of instruction. And all the time and money spent on learning styles and related training could be better spent on interventions that actually improve learning. You are not a visual learner, nor an auditory learner, nor a kinesthetic\n learner. Or more accurately, you are all these kinds of learner in one. The best learning experiences are those that involve multiple different ways of understanding the same thing. And best of all, this strategy works not just for one\n set of people, but for everyone. This part of the video was sponsored by Google search. There are lots of topics out there that are controversial, like learning styles for example.\n Most people believe learning styles are a thing, whereas educational researchers find no robust evidence for them. And if you search for learning styles, you'll get lots of sites with resources and quizzes. But if you search for learning styles debunked, well then you'll\n find articles about how there is very little evidence for the learning styles hypothesis. I think one of the most common traps people fall into is only searching for information that confirms what they already believe. A common mistake is putting the answer you're looking for right in\n the search query. A better idea is to try another search, adding debunked or false at the end, and see what comes up. Google makes it easy to get more detail about the source of the information. Just click the three dots next to any search result, and then you can judge for yourself whether\n the information is trustworthy and if you want to visit the site. A Google search is meant to surface the most relevant information for your query, but it's up to you to formulate that query, try a few different searches, and assess whether the information is reliable. And the whole point\n of Veritasium is to get to the truth. So I'm excited to encourage everyone to think more critically about how we get information. I want to thank Google for sponsoring this part of the video, and I want to thank you for watching."

            "transcription": "I have a friend named Sammy, who back in the early 2000s wrote some code for his MySpace page. What the code did was anyone who visited his page would have his picture and the tagline that said, Sammy is my hero,\n copied over to their homepage. And that was a bit of fun for a while, but Sammy wanted more, and so he tweaked his code so that not only the picture and the tagline were copied over, but also the code itself. And now it exploded. In just nine hours, he\n reached 480 accounts. In 13 hours he was up to 8,800 and in just over 18 hours he had hit a million accounts which was a full 1 35th of all the accounts on MySpace at the time. So in a panic he tried to delete his page\n And when he was successful, he actually took down the whole of MySpace with it. He was arrested and convicted of computer hacking and ordered not to touch a computer for the next three years. But I think what this story really tells us is just how connected\n Imagine you have 44 friends, and each one of those friends has 44 friends who are not also your friends. And each of them has an additional 44 friends, each of whom has 44 friends, who again has 44 friends.\n friends and they have 44 more. Then in a chain of just six steps you would be connected to 44 to the 6 or 7.26 billion people more than are alive on earth today. And we've contemplated how\n closely connected we are since long before MySpace even existed. Back in 1929, a Hungarian author and poet named Frigyes Kerenci wrote a short story called Chains, and in it one of the characters challenges the others to find another person on Earth\n that he cannot connect himself to through fewer than five intermediaries. This is the origin of six degrees of separation. If the theory is correct, it means that you would be connected to the Queen or Tom Cruise in just six steps.\n But they may be the easy ones. What about this shop owner or the Mongolian sheep herder? What the theory really means is that any two people picked at random from anywhere on the earth will be connected by just six steps. The idea remained just fictional.\n until in the 1960s a Harvard psychologist Stanley Milgram attempted to test it. He called it the small world experiment. After that phenomenon where you're at a party you meet a stranger and you find out that you have a friend in common and you remark, oh it's such a small world.\n world. What he did was he sent out 300 packages to people both in Boston and in Nebraska. Now what he wanted those people to do was try to send their package to a target person in Boston, but they weren't allowed to send it directly to him. They had to send\n it to someone they knew on a first name basis who they thought had a better chance of knowing the target and they could forward it on in the same way. Now as you might expect most of the packages never made it, but 64 did and the average path length was 5.2.\n So now 6 degrees of separation had experimental confirmation. Or did it? If you look more closely at Milgram's sample, you find that of the 300 people, 100 were located in Boston, the actual city where the target lived.\n Another hundred were stockbrokers, which was the same profession as the Target. So only 100 people lived in a different state and had a different job. And of them, only 18 of their packages made it to the Target.\n So we're talking about a sample size of 18 is all the evidence there was for 6 degrees of separation. So experimental evidence was tough to come by, but a decade earlier a mathematician named Paul Erdos had tried to work out the theoretical properties of\n of networks like these. But he didn't have any information on the structure of real social networks, so he decided to work on networks where the connections between nodes were all completely random. And we can actually simulate a network like this using buttons and thread, where we just connect up the\n buttons at random. What Erdahls found is that when the number of links per node is small, the network is fragmented. Pick up any button and few others will come with it. But once you exceed an average of one connection per node, the behavior of the network changes dramatically. They almost\n all link up forming a giant cluster. Now if you pick up any button almost all of the rest will come with it. This change happens rapidly and it resembles a phase transition in physics. You could call this a small world network since the path between any\n two buttons is short.\n represent real life very well. So what do real world networks look like? Well for that we need to go to the empirical data. In 1994 a couple of college kids invented a game called Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon in which you try to connect any action\n to Kevin Bacon through just six steps through his co-stars. Now a couple of sociology researchers got access to their database of a quarter million actors and they analyzed the network and what they found was that it was a small world network meaning\n Between any two actors, there were only a very small number of steps. And that's very similar to a random network. But unlike a random network, the actor network also showed a high degree of clustering. That is, they often work together in small groups. So,\n Now how do you get both this grouping behavior, a high degree of clustering, and the short number of steps between any two actors? Well to figure this out, they looked at two different extremes. Imagine a circle of nodes. Now if you connect them at random\n random, you get the same outcome as ERDOS. Short paths between any two nodes, but little clustering. Now consider connecting up the nodes only with their nearest two neighbors on each side. Now clustering is high, but path lengths are long for two nodes\n So the key to modeling real social networks\n The important thing about fireworks is to have a lot of clustering behavior, that is, your friends are also friends with each other, but also to have a few random acquaintances. And the importance of those acquaintances can't be overstated. There was a researcher named Granovetter in the 1970s who published a paper\n published a paper called The Strength of Weak Ties, in which he points out you are much more likely to get a job through those random acquaintances than through your close friends. And if you think about it, that makes sense, because you and your close friends all know the same people and have the same\n information. It's through the random acquaintances that you can get connections with people very far from your social circle so you can find new jobs, new places to live, and you can be connected to the outside world. So in fact it is those random acquaintances that make possible\n 6 degrees of separation.\n Facebook that the friendship circles have grown. Not that they're bosom buddies, but they're people who have access to it. That's the point. And it's, do you know this person who then knows that so that I have access to these other people? So I'm told that it has dropped. It's not just the six degrees, we're down at four\n I think Neil deGrasse Tyson might be right. In 2011 Facebook analyzed their data and they found that 92% of their users were connected through just five steps and that number is decreasing over time. The concept of\n Six degrees of separation has fascinated people for nearly a century, and I think that's not only because of how counterintuitive it is, but also how comforting it is to know how closely we are all linked, not in some kind of abstract, ill-defined way, but\n through hard scientific data. Just six handshakes will connect you to anyone else on the planet. Now I have a challenge for you. In the spirit of six degrees of separation, I want to try an experiment. I want you to try\n to\n I will send you a postcard in the mail and I'll tally up if we were able to get that done in six links or not. So let's try to do it and see if we can connect. The instructions are in the description.\n This episode of Veritasium was inspired by the Fine Brothers, Ben and Raffy Fine, who are friends of mine, so we are connected through just one degree of separation. Now they have a brand new TV series launching on TruTV, it's called The Six Degrees of Everything, and it's a fast-paced\n comedic show that tries to show us how six things that we don't think are connected actually are. It involves sketch comedy and songs and reality TV. I'm really looking forward to seeing how they are going to do this. So you can check it out Tuesdays at 930 or 830 Central.\n on TruTV. I am so looking forward to it. And thank you to the Fine Brothers for sponsoring this episode so I can check out the science of networks."

            "transcription": "Research has shown that if you're repeatedly exposed to the phrase, the body temperature of a chicken, that's right, the body temperature of a chicken. Even if no useful information is given about the body temperature of a chicken, you are\n likely to judge as true this statement the body temperature of a chicken is 34 degrees celsius it's not by the way it's actually closer to 41 but this finding highlights an important aspect of our psychology that plays a huge role in how we see the\n the world. The things we're exposed to repeatedly feel more true. Now the way this seems to work is through a mechanism called cognitive ease. Cognitive ease is a measure of how hard your brain is working from easy like when you're scrolling through Facebook to hard like if you're trying to multiply\n 14 times 37 in your head. Things that are true generally elicit cognitive ease, like fire is hot, earth revolves around the sun, dogs have four legs, and so on. Not only do these things feel true, they also feel familiar, effortless, and they feel good.\n All of these are outcomes of cognitive ease. Now the trouble arises because cognitive ease can be artificially created in other ways. One way is just by repeating the stimulus. In a classic experiment at two Michigan universities, experimenters took out ads in the school newsroom.\n newspapers. Each ad consisted only of one of these nonsense words. They were printed with different frequencies. One word appeared in the paper only once, while others appeared 2, 5, 10, or 25\n The word frequencies were reversed at the other university. At the end of the experiment, researchers sent out questionnaires asking people to rate the meaning of each of these nonsense words on a scale from it means something good to it means something bad.\n So with enough repetition, even a nonsense word comes to feel familiar. It triggers cognitive ease and overall feelings of goodness.\n have shown that this also works when showing English speakers, Chinese characters, or even random shapes. And the finding is even more general than that. Songs are judged more favorably after you've listened to them a bunch of times than on the first listening, and participants looking at yearbook\n photos judge the people in the photos as more likeable after seeing that photo more times. Which that brings up the question, what are the Kardashians famous for? Depending on who you ask, you may find that they're famous for nothing or just famous for being famous, but really\n they are famous for exactly the same reason anyone is famous and that's because you've heard their names and seen their faces over and over again. Now they are familiar, you have experience with them in the past and therefore they are processed with cognitive ease which also feels good. This is at the core\n of the advertising industry, the idea that repeated often enough, even brown carbonated sugar water seems really appealing. But maybe it shouldn't be surprising that repeated stimuli are perceived more favorably. After all, our brains have evolved to identify threats.\n And anything novel is a potential threat, but if after repeated exposure nothing bad happens, it becomes familiar and comfortable and therefore a sign of safety rather than a threat. And this general phenomenon extends beyond humans. Chicks who were\n played a tone when they were in the egg, later made fewer distress calls when the same tone was played to them as chicks. But repetition is not the only way to create cognitive ease. Images with higher contrast are perceived by the brain with more cognitive ease, making them\n feel good, which explains most of the Instagram filters. In another study, people who were shown images where the outline was projected quickly and imperceptibly before the image, they started to smile and they relaxed their brows as measured by electrodes on these\n Videos with bad audio quality and low contrast create cognitive strain as you try to figure out what's going on, possibly searching for threats. You may not have noticed just now, but your brow is probably furrowed and your mouth started to frown, which is why we prefer high-concept videos.\n contrast video with crisp audio. And the same applies to text. So which of these statements do you think is true? Well, actually it's a trick question. He was born in 1879, but studies have shown that people will often choose the more\n answer. Nice, contrasty, bold text is easier and quicker to read. It's handled with more cognitive ease and is therefore judged to be more true. Lawyers with easily pronounced last names are overrepresented higher up the chain in law firms. Even\n controlling for the rarity and ethnicity of the names. And even companies that have pronounceable abbreviations on the stock market outperform those with unpronounceable tags, which you'll be happy to know if you have stock in those companies. And being happy, in fact, that makes you more\n likely to experience cognitive ease as well. This in turn makes you more intuitive. Try this. What connects these three things? Cottage, Swiss, cake. All English speakers recognize a unique solution, cheese.\n How about sky bulb high? The answer is light. Now not all sets of three words share a connection of course, but what's amazing is experiments have shown people can determine whether they do or not in only a few\n seconds long before they figure out what the actual association is. This is due to the sensation of cognitive ease. Somewhere deep in the brain these associations cause a flicker of recognition which feels pleasant. It's the same reason why people say to go with\n with your gut on multiple-choice tests if you're not exactly sure of the answer. Now is this true or false? All roses are flowers. Some flowers fade quickly. Therefore some roses fade quickly.\n The actual answer is false. Roses aren't necessarily the some flowers that fade quickly. A test using a similar set of three questions found that 90%\n of people made at least one mistake when the questions were printed clearly. But when the test was printed like this, the error rate dropped to 35%. Making the test harder to read actually increased the accuracy of results. This is because the alleged\n The audible text creates cognitive strain, forcing your brain to work harder, and that helps avoid the pitfall of jumping to the intuitive but wrong answer. Cognitive ease is useful for being creative and intuitive, but it also makes you more gullible. So for the written part of your driving test,\n going with your gut is probably a good strategy. But in areas like physics where the answers are counterintuitive and there are many common misconceptions, it's important to be more skeptical. This vigilance takes effort and it's also associated with being unhappy. Have you ever noticed\n that some of the best scientists and analytical minds are grumpy and suspicious of everything? I mean, I think this could be more than just poor social skills, it may be essential for them to do their job. And this is a paradox of learning and critical thinking. Cognitive ease\n Pleasant it is effortless familiar and it really does make you more creative and intuitive But it can also trick you it may make things seem true that aren't and you may feel like you're learning when you're not On the other hand being skeptical and analytical\n Now you might think that the point of this video is to say that we all need to think critically more often, but that's not it. As an analytical thinker myself, I've\n I find it takes me like half an hour just to select a toothbrush. There are definitely times when cognitive ease is the appropriate mental state. I mean we evolved it for a reason so we can react intuitively in familiar everyday situations. Why think harder than you have to?\n to identify those times when more thought is required. But with sharing and repeating ideas easier than ever before, I think we need to be more vigilant to distinguish between those things that are really true and those we've simply heard many times before.\n The more something is repeated, the more it starts to feel true.

            "transcription": "Do not hit the like button or the dislike button, at least not yet. I want you to consider a problem that's been one of the most controversial in math and philosophy over the past 20 years. There is no consensus answer, so I want you to listen to the problem\n and then vote for the answer you prefer using the like and dislike buttons. Okay? Here is the setup. Sleeping Beauty volunteers to be the subject of an experiment. And before it starts, she's informed of the procedure. On Sunday night,\n will be put to sleep and then a fair coin will be flipped. If that coin comes up heads she'll be awakened on Monday and then put back to sleep. If the coin comes up tails she will also be awakened on Monday and put back to sleep but then she will be awakened\n on Tuesday as well and then put back to sleep. Now each time she gets put back to sleep she will forget that she was ever awakened. In the brief period anytime she's awake she will be told no information but she'll be asked one\n question. What do you believe is the probability that the coin came up heads? So how should she answer? Feel free to pause the video and answer the question for yourself right now. This was my reaction after hearing the problem\n for the first time.\n But you know what's really interesting is you just answered that the probability of a coin coming up heads is one third. I think a lot of this comes down to what specific question is asked of her. What is the probability that a fair coin flipped gives heads? That's 50%.\n What is the probability that the coin came up heads? I would say the answer is a third from her perspective. It's remarkably the same question.\n half is because she knows the coin is fair. Nothing changes between when the coin is flipped and when she wakes up, and she knew for a fact that she would be woken up and she receives no new information when that happens. Imagine that instead\n Instead of flipping the coin after she's asleep, the experimenters flip the coin first and ask her immediately, what's the probability that the coin came up heads? Well, she would certainly say one half. So why should anything change after she goes to sleep and wakes up?\n This is known as the Hafer Position. But there is another way to look at it. Others would argue that something does change when she's awakened. I mean, it seems like she gets no new information. There are no calendars. No one tells her anything and she\n She knew that she would be woken up, but she actually learns something important. She learns that she's gone from existing in a reality where there are two possible states, the coin came up either heads or tails, to existing in a reality where there are three possible states.\n Monday heads, Monday tails, or Tuesday tails, and therefore she should assign equal probability to each of these three outcomes where heads only occurred in one. So the probability that the coin came up heads is one third.\n This is known as the 3rder position. Now I know it seems wrong to suggest that a fair coin should have a 1 third probability of coming up heads, but that's because the question she's asked is subtly different. The implied question is, given you're awake,\n What's the probability that the coin came up heads? And that is one third. Now, Havers would counter that just because there are three possible outcomes doesn't mean they are each equally likely. In the Monty Hall problem, for example, the contestant ultimately has to choose between two doors.\n But it'd be wrong to assign them 50-50 odds. The prize is actually twice as likely to be behind one door than the other. In the Sleeping Beauty problem, we know a heads outcome and a tails outcome are equally likely, so the chance of waking up on Monday with heads is\n is 50% and the chance of waking up on Monday or Tuesday with tails should be 50%. Therefore, the tails probability gets split across 2 days, 25% each. But if you repeat the experiment over and over, which you can try for your\n herself by repeatedly flipping a coin, you find she wakes up a third of the time Monday heads, a third of the time Monday tails, and a third of the time Tuesday tails. Not 50-25-25 like the previous analysis would suggest.\n So if you were Sleeping Beauty and you were awakened and asked what's the probability the coin came up heads? What would you say? If you would say one third then hit the like button if you would say one half hit the dislike button\n The answer may seem obvious to you, but you should know that to other people the other answer seems equally obvious. And that's why hundreds and hundreds of philosophy papers have been published on this problem over the past 22 years.\n been many variations of this problem. Like, what if instead of being woken up twice if the coin lands tails, she's instead woken up a million times? If the coin comes up heads, she's still woken only once. Doesn't it seem absurd in this case when sleeping\n Beauty wakes up to say that it was just as likely that the coin landed heads as tails, when we know there are a million more wake-ups in the tails case than in the heads case. I mean, if you reach into a bag of one white marble and a million black marbles, what are the chances that you\n pull out that one white marble. I was pretty convinced by this and I considered myself a thirder, but this same argument is used to convince people that we're living in a simulation. The thinking goes that our computing technology has improved so dramatically that\n even over just the last 40 years, that we can imagine a time in the not too distant future when we can create a completely realistic simulation of our world. And once that occurs, it should be trivial to make unlimited copies of that simulation.\n And then if you were to ask someone if they're living in a simulation, they would have to admit that they probably are because there are many more instances of that existence than the one true external reality. But how do we know that this hasn't happened already and that we're living inside\n simulation. I mean if it can happen then it probably has happened and we are living in a simulation. This seems like the logical conclusion of the Third World View. Now I personally don't buy that I'm living in a simulation and I think most people don't buy it.\n but maybe that's just illogical bias. But there's another thought experiment that makes me seriously reconsider the third-order position. Let's say there's a soccer game between a really great team like Brazil and a less world-dominating team like Canada.\n So the odds are 80-20 in Brazil's favor. Now a researcher is going to put you to sleep before the game starts. And if Brazil wins, they'll wake you up one time. But if Canada wins, they'll wake you up 30 times in a row. And just like Sleeping Beauty\n Maybe you won't remember if you've been woken before. Okay, so the game is about to start. You fall asleep. And now you're woken up. Who do you think won the game? The thirder would say Canada.\n I would almost certainly say Brazil. I mean, why should I give any weight to what the researcher would have done if Canada had one when I'm fairly confident that they won't? To extend this, let's say Brazil plays Canada five times and we do this experiment each time.\n Well then if you say Brazil each time you're woken up, you would probably be right about four out of five of the games. But if you said Canada every time, you would be wrong about those four games, but right 30 times in a row when you're repeatedly asked about Canada's winnings.\n If you stand to win a bet by correctly answering the question, then by all means you should bet on Canada. But if you want to correctly pick the winner of more of the games, well then you should say Brazil. And this is what's at the heart of the dispute between Hafer's\n and thirders in the Sleeping Beauty problem. If you want to be right about the outcome of the coin tosses, well you should say the probability of heads is a half. But if you want to answer more questionings correctly, well then you should say one third. I want to leave you\n with one last thought experiment. Imagine that you know for a fact that before our universe began there was a coin flip and if it came up heads only a single universe would be created. But if it came up tails a quasi-infinite multiverse would be\n be created. And in each of those multiverse universes you'd find every possible variation of Earth and the people on it. In some versions, there would be no Earth. Now you becoming conscious is just like sleeping beauty\n waking up. There's no way to tell if you're in that single universe or in one of the multiverse universes, but you know there are a lot more of them. So would you think that you're for sure in the multiverse? Or are the chances\n 50-50.\n Brilliant offers probability courses that walk you through lots of situational probability questions. Do you want to learn how to build your own simulations?

            "transcription": "I'm going to scream as loud as I can and I'm going to keep screaming as loud as I can while I spin around. I'll keep going until my breath runs out. Great. You ready? Yeah. Okay.\n That was outstanding, thank you. Thank you. The quietest place on earth is apparently an anechoic chamber in Minneapolis. Now I'm here at BYU at their anechoic chamber. Anechoic is Latin, it basically means\n no echo and the way they achieve no echo is through all of these foam wedges which are put on the walls and even the floor you can see that I'm actually on a spring floor and down below me there are all of these wedges now you may want to use headphones\n while you're listening to this video because that's gonna be quite important. Low frequency sound will come in and by the shape of it bounce and just keep bouncing pretty much forever until it just gets lost in the wall. And then high frequencies are more\n going to get absorbed into the foam itself. You can hear how the room deadens echoes by clapping constantly while closing the doors.\n Totally changed the quality of the sound.\n There are reports that it's impossible to stay in one of these rooms and remain sane for a significant period of time. The record is apparently 45 minutes. I felt a little claustrophobic. I got, it felt like there's a lot of pressure on my head. But why would that be?\n I mean the air is no different in here. What I figured is just because when you listen in a normal room there's a lot of reverb. To your ear that means there's a lot of space but there's none of that in here so it feels claustrophobic. It feels like you're in a tiny room like you're you could be in a\n or coughing. I think it's really an anxiety response so you're used to having these sounds around you and then you don't anymore and so you start to panic because you don't have something you're used to and I think that anxiety it can increase and cause some stress.\n and maybe that's why people go crazy or hallucinate with sound. It's just because they're trying to make up for what they're used to that isn't there. When I bring people in I warn them, hey if you get a little dizzy please let me know so I can get you out of the room before you make a mess.\n in our expensive facilities.\n The longer you stay in there the more you hear. So you start to hear the blood flow through your brain. Have you heard it? Mm-hmm. It sounds kind of like a ringing or a pulsing. Can you kind of make the sound for us so that we know what to listen out for? Of the blood flow? It just sounds like a pulsing.\n Some people say they can hear their heartbeat coming from their chest as well. Have you heard that? No. A violinist placed in one of these rooms was apparently banging on the door within a matter of seconds trying to get out. Now other people say it's impossible to stand up because\n because you become so disoriented, dizzy, nauseous, and some people even hear oral hallucinations. But to me it doesn't sound right. You know, I believe that I should be able to sit in a room with no sound, with the lights off, for as long as I like. And so I'm going to put\n myself to the test by staying in this room for as long as I can. Have fun in silence. Thank you. Now it is just\n me in the anechoic chamber and this is probably the quietest place I have ever been. In a second I'll tell the guys shut the lights off. Okay I think oh\n I'm ready and the lights are off. I'm going to turn off the camera so I don't have this light and then there's only the audio recorder that I'll keep with me.\n Not sure how\n I've been in here but I still feel quite comfortable. It's nice and quiet. I mean, that's an understatement. But it's relaxing.\n If I hear anything I feel like I hear a low pitched hum.\n\u5730\u4e0b\u9244\u306e\u99c5\u306f1997\u5e74\u306b\u958b\u696d\n If I had to guess about how long I've been in here, I'd say about eight minutes. I feel like I'm more aware of my heart.\n I can feel each pulse and I can almost feel it radiating up my chest towards my head like a wave.\n ears, they're the hiss. I think that's just from hearing loss. This just reminds me of that Mission Impossible movie where Tom Cruise sneaks into that building and he has to\n Keep his decibel level low. That was a burp. I don't know if you could hear that. I can say the really small sounds seem amplified.\n It's like your brain has recalibrated so the quiet things seem much louder. I feel like I can feel more things like...\n With every beat of my heart it feels like my body shakes a little bit. Like a device that has a little motor inside it, how it gets shook around like a phone.\n Okay, Cameron, looks to me like we're good for time. If it looks the same to you, like we're in 46 minutes or over, I'm happy to hop out. So, uh...\n yeah when you're ready you can flip the lights back on if you like. Are you there? Hello?\n I think I've been here for nearly an hour according to my time checks and I didn't fall asleep. I just, you know, I've had a good time. It's a nice quiet space. I kind of feel like this would be a good material to pad your bedroom in. Not a problem.\n chamber 45 minutes an hour easy I could stay in here for five hours I think I could get a lot of work done in here so now I just have to get out yeah\n and I'm gonna see if I can exit this room without them turning the lights on.\n Even the door is nice and quiet. Here we are, back to the outside world.\n Hello. How you doing? You live? I am.\n I don't really understand how anyone could go crazy in there. I mean, quiet is kind of nice. But then again, there are people who find all sorts of situations really uncomfortable, like just being in a pitch black room or being in a small confined space. So maybe those types of people would find\n this kind of unnerving. I definitely noticed that there were a lot of noises. Like it wasn't just pure silence. Like I actually had to work hard to make things feel silent. Otherwise, you know, there was the sound of like just me rubbing my beard.\n or just like the rustle of your clothes or every time you swallow when you breathe. Perhaps the weirdest thing I noticed was like my sense of my heart. I just felt like it was pumping really hard and\n I could feel almost like the blood pushing up through me. It wasn't like I was hearing it. It was just like I was feeling it. And I was feeling as though, in a way, my heart was shaking my body. That was something weird. But besides that...\n nothing crazy no no weird hallucinations or anything like that so I think the the myth that you can't stay in here for longer than 45 minutes is is busted even though this is not myth busters I I still think it's\n It's not true.\n the best sellers ever since it was released.
