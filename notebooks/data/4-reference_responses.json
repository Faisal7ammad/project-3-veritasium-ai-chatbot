        "reference_response": "According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, the speed of light is considered the ultimate speed limit in the universe. This theory suggests that nothing should move through space faster than light. While there have been proposals and experiments attempting to exceed the speed of light, such as shining a laser at the moon or using a long rigid stick, these methods ultimately do not allow for actual transmission of information faster than light. The principle of relativity comes into play when considering speeds approaching that of light, leading to interesting consequences like time dilation, length contraction, and infinite mass as an object approaches the speed of light. Despite recent experimental results suggesting neutrinos could travel faster than light, the consensus in the scientific community remains that the speed of light is a fundamental constant that serves as a universal speed limit in the universe."

The Congress meets in the Palace of the Parliament (Palacio de las Cortes) in Madrid.\nCongress has 350 members elected from fifty-two constituencies (the fifty provinces and two autonomous cities) using closed list D'Hondt proportional representation. Deputies serve four-year terms. The presiding officer and speaker is the President of the Congress of Deputies, who is elected by the members at the first sitting of Congress after an election.\nThe two principle actors in Congress are parliamentary groups and parliamentary committees (Spanish: comissiones). All MPs are required to be members of a parliamentary group, the institutionalised form of political parties. Groups act with one voice represented by their spokesperson. In other words the Spanish Parliament is a parliament of groups, not individual MPs who are constrained to act only as part of the group. MPs can only act autonomously when submitting oral or written questions.\nAs a result of the 2019 general election, there were 168 female deputies or 48% of all members, making Spain the European country with the highest percentage of women in parliament, surpassing Sweden and Finland."

        "query": "Who's Henrietta Leavitt?",
        "reference_response": "I couldn't find relevant information in Veritasium's YouTube channel, but here's some information from Wikipedia:\n\nHenrietta Swan Leavitt (; July 4, 1868 \u2013 December 12, 1921) was an American astronomer. Her discovery of how to effectively measure vast distances to remote galaxies led to a shift in the scale and understanding of the scale and the nature of the universe. Nomination of Leavitt for the Nobel Prize had to be halted because of her death. \nA graduate of Radcliffe College, she worked at the Harvard College Observatory as a human computer, tasked with measuring photographic plates to catalog the positions and brightness of stars. This work led her to discover the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variables. Leavitt's discovery provided astronomers with the first standard candle with which to measure the distance to other galaxies.\nBefore Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variables (sometimes referred to as Leavitt's Law), the only techniques available to astronomers for measuring the distance to a star were based on stellar parallax. Such techniques can only be used for measuring distances out to several hundred light years. Leavitt's great insight was that while no one knew the distance to the Small Magellanic Cloud, all its stars must be roughly the same distance from Earth. Therefore, a relationship she discovered in it, between the period of certain variable stars (Cepheids) and their apparent brightness, reflected a relationship in their absolute brightness. Once calibrated by measuring the distance to a nearby star of the same type via parallax, her discovery became a measuring stick with vastly greater reach. \nAfter Leavitt's death, Edwin Hubble found Cepheids in several nebulae, including the Andromeda Nebula, and, using Leavitt's Law, calculated that their distance was far too great to be part of the Milky Way and were separate galaxies in their own right. This settled astronomy's Great Debate over the size of the universe. Hubble later used Leavitt's Law, together with galactic redshifts, to establish that the universe is expanding (see Hubble's law)."

        "query": "tell me about black holes.",
        "reference_response": "Black holes are some of the most mysterious and intriguing objects in the universe. According to the general theory of relativity, black holes are regions in spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. This point of no return is called the event horizon. \n\nOne of the key features of black holes is their ability to warp spacetime itself. In Einstein's theory, massive objects like stars or black holes curve the fabric of spacetime around them, causing other objects to move along curved paths. This warping effect of spacetime by a black hole is what creates the strong gravitational pull that defines a black hole.\n\nBlack holes are characterized by two main properties: mass and spin. The mass of a black hole determines its gravitational pull, while the spin indicates how fast the black hole is rotating. Black holes can range in size from stellar mass black holes, which are a few times the mass of our Sun, to supermassive black holes, which can be billions of times more massive.\n\nThe spin of a black hole is harder to measure than its mass, but it plays a crucial role in determining the size of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole. The spin of a black hole influences the size of the ISCO, with faster-spinning black holes having smaller ISCOs. This relationship between spin and ISCO can help scientists understand the maximum spin a black hole can have and whether a black hole could potentially have a \"naked singularity,\" where the event horizon does not cover the singularity at the center.\n\nBlack holes can interact with their surroundings in various ways, such as accreting matter from nearby stars or galaxies, emitting powerful jets of radiation, and even merging with other black holes. Tidal disruption events, where a star gets torn apart by the gravitational forces of a black hole, are rare but provide valuable insights into the behavior of black holes.\n\nRecent advancements, such as the first-ever image of a black hole in the galaxy M87, have provided strong evidence for the existence of black holes and confirmed Einstein's general theory of relativity in extreme gravitational conditions. These discoveries continue to deepen our understanding of black holes and their role in shaping the cosmos."

        "query": "What is the relevance of black holes in quantum mechanics?",
        "reference_response": "The relevance of black holes in quantum mechanics lies in the study of black hole entropy and Hawking radiation. Jacob Bekenstein proposed that the entropy of a black hole should be proportional to its surface area, suggesting a link between black holes and thermodynamics. This idea was initially met with skepticism, as it implied that black holes should have a temperature and emit radiation, contradicting their \"black\" nature. Stephen Hawking's research on black hole evaporation led to the discovery of Hawking radiation, confirming that black holes have a temperature and emit radiation, thus supporting the concept of black hole entropy.\n\nThis connection between black holes, entropy, and radiation has profound implications for quantum mechanics and our understanding of the universe's thermodynamic properties. The study of black hole entropy and Hawking radiation has provided insights into the behavior of quantum fields in curved spacetime and the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. It has also contributed to the ongoing efforts to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity in the search for a unified theory of physics, such as quantum gravity.\n\nIn conclusion, black holes play a crucial role in quantum mechanics by challenging our understanding of entropy, radiation, and the fundamental laws governing the universe, prompting further exploration at the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity."
